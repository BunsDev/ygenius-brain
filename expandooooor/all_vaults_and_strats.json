Wrapped ETH, or WETH, refers to an ERC-20 compatible version of ether. ERC-20 is a technical standard developed after the release of ETH that allow tokens created on the Ethereum blockchain to interact with each other. \nIn order for ETH to be exchanged with other ERC-20s it needs to be wrapped into WETH. Wrapping ETH does not affect its value, 1 ETH = 1 WETH.","icon":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yearn/yearn-assets/master/icons/multichain-tokens/1/0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2/logo-128.png","decimals":18},"tvl":{"total_assets":"32308093914850952","total_delegated_assets":"0","tvl_deposited":53.22607971677811,"tvl_delegated":0,"tvl":53.22607971677811,"price":1647.453417},"apy":{"type":"","gross_apr":0,"net_apy":0,"fees":{"performance":0,"withdrawal":0,"management":0,"keep_crv":0,"cvx_keep_crv":0},"points":{"week_ago":0,"month_ago":0,"inception":0},"composite":{"boost":0,"pool_apy":0,"boosted_apr":0,"base_apr":0,"cvx_apr":0,"rewards_apr":0}},"details":{"management":"0x16388463d60FFE0661Cf7F1f31a7D658aC790ff7","governance":"0x16388463d60FFE0661Cf7F1f31a7D658aC790ff7","guardian":"0xC3D6880fD95E06C816cB030fAc45b3ffe3651Cb0","rewards":"0xC3D6880fD95E06C816cB030fAc45b3ffe3651Cb0","depositLimit":"0","availableDepositLimit":"0","comment":"3.0 weth vault","apyTypeOverride":"","apyOverride":0,"order":200,"performanceFee":1000,"managementFee":0,"depositsDisabled":true,"withdrawalsDisabled":false,"allowZapIn":false,"allowZapOut":true,"retired":true,"hideAlways":true},"strategies":[],"migration":{"available":true,"address":"0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c","contract":"0x1824df8D751704FA10FA371d62A37f9B8772ab90"}},{"address":"0x8B58Aa42A4Aa222b684078459CE03Dd0A43342B1","type":"Experimental","symbol":"yvUSDP","display_symbol":"yvUSDP","formated_symbol":"yvUSDP","name":"USDP yVault","display_name":"USDP","formated_name":"USDP yVault","icon":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yearn/yearn-assets/master/icons/multichain-tokens/1/0x8B58Aa42A4Aa222b684078459CE03Dd0A43342B1/logo-128.png","version":"0.3.5","category":"Stablecoin","inception":1619192695,"decimals":18,"chainID":1,"riskScore":0,"endorsed":false,"emergency_shutdown":false,"token":{"address":"0x1456688345527be1f37e9e627da0837d6f08c925","underlyingTokensAddresses":[],"name":"USDP Stablecoin","symbol":"USDP","type":"","display_name":"USDP Stablecoin","display_symbol":"USDP","description":"","icon":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yearn/yearn-assets/master/icons/multichain-tokens/1/0x1456688345527bE1f37E9e627DA0837D6f08C925/logo-128.png","decimals":18},"tvl":{"total_assets":"0","total_delegated_assets":"0","tvl_deposited":0,"tvl_delegated":0,"tvl":0,"price":0.997303},"apy":{"type":"","gross_apr":0,"net_apy":0,"fees":{"performance":0,"withdrawal":0,"management":0,"keep_crv":0,"cvx_keep_crv":0},"points":{"week_ago":0,"month_ago":0,"inception":0},"composite":{"boost":0,"pool_apy":0,"boosted_apr":0,"base_apr":0,"cvx_apr":0,"rewards_apr":0}},"details":{"management":"0x710295b5f326c2e47E6dD2E7F6b5b0F7c5AC2F24","governance":"0x710295b5f326c2e47E6dD2E7F6b5b0F7c5AC2F24","guardian":"0x846e211e8ba920B353FB717631C015cf04061Cc9","rewards":"0x93A62dA5a14C80f265DAbC077fCEE437B1a0Efde","depositLimit":"1000000000000000000000000000","availableDepositLimit":"1000000000000000000000000000","comment":"3.5 usdp vault","apyTypeOverride":"","apyOverride":0,"order":200,"performanceFee":1000,"managementFee":200,"depositsDisabled":true,"withdrawalsDisabled":false,"allowZapIn":false,"allowZapOut":true,"retired":true,"hideAlways":true},"strategies":[],"migration":{"available":false,"address":"0x8B58Aa42A4Aa222b684078459CE03Dd0A43342B1","contract":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}},{"address":"0xAc1C90b9c76d56BA2e24F3995F7671c745f8f308","type":"Experimental","symbol":"yvAAVE","display_symbol":"yvAAVE","formated_symbol":"yvAAVE","name":"AAVE yVault","display_name":"Aave","formated_name":"Aave yVault","icon":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yearn/yearn-assets/master/icons/multichain-tokens/1/0xAc1C90b9c76d56BA2e24F3995F7671c745f8f308/logo-128.png","version":"0.3.2","category":"Volatile","inception":1615238900,"decimals":18,"chainID":1,"riskScore":0,"endorsed":false,"emergency_shutdown":false,"token":{"address":"0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9","underlyingTokensAddresses":[],"name":"Aave Token","symbol":"AAVE","type":"","display_name":"Aave Token","display_symbol":"AAVE","description":"Aave is a decentralized money market where users can lend and borrow more than 25 different crypto assets.

Wrapped ETH, or WETH, refers to an ERC-20 compatible version of ether. ERC-20 is a technical standard developed after the release of ETH that allow tokens created on the Ethereum blockchain to interact with each other. \nIn order for ETH to be exchanged with other ERC-20s it needs to be wrapped into WETH. Wrapping ETH does not affect its value, 1 ETH = 1 WETH.","icon":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yearn/yearn-assets/master/icons/multichain-tokens/1/0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2/logo-128.png","decimals":18},"tvl":{"total_assets":"851795468147526399","total_delegated_assets":"1","tvl_deposited":1403.293354584757,"tvl_delegated":1.6474534170000002e-15,"tvl":1403.293354584757,"price":1647.453417},"apy":{"type":"","gross_apr":0,"net_apy":0,"fees":{"performance":0,"withdrawal":0,"management":0,"keep_crv":0,"cvx_keep_crv":0},"points":{"week_ago":0,"month_ago":0,"inception":0},"composite":{"boost":0,"pool_apy":0,"boosted_apr":0,"base_apr":0,"cvx_apr":0,"rewards_apr":0}},"details":{"management":"0x50c1a2eA0a861A967D9d0FFE2AE4012c2E053804","governance":"0x16388463d60FFE0661Cf7F1f31a7D658aC790ff7","guardian":"0x16388463d60FFE0661Cf7F1f31a7D658aC790ff7","rewards":"0x16388463d60FFE0661Cf7F1f31a7D658aC790ff7","depositLimit":"34000000000000000000","availableDepositLimit":"33148204531852473601","comment":"4.3 weth vault","apyTypeOverride":"","apyOverride":0,"order":244,"performanceFee":1000,"managementFee":0,"depositsDisabled":true,"withdrawalsDisabled":false,"allowZapIn":false,"allowZapOut":true,"retired":true,"hideAlways":false},"strategies":[],"migration":{"available":true,"address":"0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c","contract":"0x1824df8D751704FA10FA371d62A37f9B8772ab90"}},{"address":"0xbD65955F752B2eF093B34B05e5FFb439AE8e5049","type":"Experimental","symbol":"yvCOMP","display_symbol":"yvCOMP","formated_symbol":"yvCOMP","name":"COMP yVault","display_name":"Comp","formated_name":"Comp yVault","icon":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yearn/yearn-assets/master/icons/multichain-tokens/1/0xbD65955F752B2eF093B34B05e5FFb439AE8e5049/logo-128.png","version":"0.4.2","category":"Volatile","inception":1625337003,"decimals":18,"chainID":1,"riskScore":0,"endorsed":false,"emergency_shutdown":false,"token":{"address":"0xc00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888","underlyingTokensAddresses":[],"name":"Compound","symbol":"COMP","type":"","display_name":"Compound","display_symbol":"COMP","description":"Compound is a decentralized blockchain protocol that allows users to lend or borrow selected cryptocurrencies.
