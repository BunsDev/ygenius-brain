## NFTreasury

Indulge us a moment while we paint you a picture.

You’re an NFT project founder. You’ve just launched your first collection, 10,000 Seasonally Depressed Sasquatches. The mint was a wild success, spiking gwei to 1200, selling out in minutes, and giving you a wallet filled with hundreds of ETH to fund your project.

**Awesome. Now what?**

At Yearn we have a lot of love for NFTs. We admire the creativity, the artistry and the sheer relentless pace of building on display. So we’ve created a tool to help project creators do what they do best (creating) while we do what we do best (securing funds and generating yield).

NFTreasury is designed to be the simplest, safest and sexiest treasury creation and management tool in existence.

### **How Does It Work?**

Most projects have short term fund needs (paying collaborators, staff, putting on events etc) and longer term financial needs — setting funds aside until needed later.

NFTreasury helps you secure those **long term **funds in a Yearn vault — so they can earn yield until your project needs them. It also helps you diversify your **short term **fund needs into USDC and ETH. All in a few clicks.

### **Step One**

Connect your project wallet to [NFTreasury.org](http://www.nftreasury.org) and decide what % of your funds you’ll need for the long and short term.

### **Step Two**

Your long term funds are sent to a secure Yearn vault, earning yield until you need them. Now it’s time to swap your short term funds into a mixture of USDC and ETH (depending on your projects needs)

### **Step Three**

Kick back, relax, and tell your discord that the treasury is sorted. All without having to spend hours on zoom with an accountant who’ll charge you $800 an hour for you to explain to him why just right clicking the jpeg is not the same as owning it.
