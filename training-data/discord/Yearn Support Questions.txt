[07/20/2020 4:16 PM] ReturnOfTheFax | Punk 6090#0790
less smart contract risk maybe? You're not exposed to balancer risk.
I guess it's just to ease friction and get people into it


[07/20/2020 4:16 PM] adrianmcli#4137
I'm in Pool 1, thinking about moving to Pool 3. My biggest worry is impermanent loss on Balancer.


[07/20/2020 4:16 PM] brad.eth#8135

@Unknown yeah and this is a reason as well. No impermanent loss in Pool 1


[07/20/2020 4:16 PM] blockomoco#9490
@Unknown the yield is different (beyond that the one is Curve and the other Balancer)

@Unknown  You're saying Pool 1 has no voting rights?

At the time of this writing, for YFI Rewards:

pool #1 APY (unstable)    : 398.9718% 
pool #2 APY (unstable)    : 875.2885% 
pool #3 APY (unstable)    : 735.6109%

@Unknown not familiar enough to answer your question reliably. Sorry


[07/20/2020 4:19 PM] adrianmcli#4137
Pool 3 returns aren't _necessarily_ larger than Pool 1, because there are more variables at play for Pool 3, specifically:

1. Impermanent loss
2. You need to put in enough to get 1000 BPT (which might mean buying YFI at a high price)
3. You need to remember to vote
4. The voting rewards can be very miniscule (just a few aDAI)
5. Losing gas from shuffling everything around


[07/20/2020 4:20 PM] blockomoco#9490
what I suspect is that it should depend on the pool traffic, how many people have staked, as well as how much FYI is remaining

@Unknown You don't have to neccessarily buy YFI to enter pool 3, that's the beauty of Balancer that you can enter with only one asset


[07/20/2020 4:21 PM] blockomoco#9490
> Isn't Pool 3 both Curve *and* Balancer?
@Unknown 

I think it only is Balancer. The balancer pool is composed of YFI and yCRV


[07/20/2020 4:21 PM] blockomoco#9490
the latter can be acquired by staking into pool #1


[07/20/2020 4:22 PM] blockomoco#9490

The y-pool on Curve has gone crazy again🤯 and it's because of $YFI (https://t.co/3AGUZJLaGc), which is the governance token of https://t.co/uncUClXHtD. Here's a guide on how to farm it!

@josemv no I think that's wrong. Entering with only one asset means you use it to buy the other asset to equalize the pool to set ratio


[07/20/2020 4:22 PM] blockomoco#9490
it is correct to claim that one can enter a balancer pool with 1 asset


[07/20/2020 4:23 PM] blockomoco#9490
in the beginning Balancer did not support that, though was added recently


[07/20/2020 4:23 PM] blockomoco#9490
you will need to pay a slippage depending which side you pick (a pool can contain more than 2 tokens as a side note)


[07/20/2020 4:24 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
> in the beginning Balancer did not support that, though was added recently
@blockomoco You can supply one asset but balancer will swap it to the proportions that the pool requires, so depending upon those proportions and the amount you are depositing, you will get a certain amount of slippage, and pay some pool fees

[07/20/2020 4:24 PM] ReturnOfTheFax | Punk 6090#0790
yeah but entering with only one assets just means that you are buying the other asset with the one you entered.
10 eth into 50/50 eth/usdc would mean 5 eth goes directly in and 5 eth buys usdc then efters the pool. Isn't that how it works?

@Unknown 

Depends how the YFI develops :)

The yield one can earn from the pools currently is very high. So that sitting on YFIs only may not be the best choice.

If you do decide to get YFI, you can stake in in balancer pools to earn yield on top of that. If you are ok with the risks


[07/20/2020 4:30 PM] blockomoco#9490
(referring to Balancer risks)


[07/20/2020 4:31 PM] neeraj3296#8152
can anyone explain what impermanent loss every is talking about here


[07/20/2020 4:31 PM] adrianmcli#4137
> @josemv no I think that's wrong. Entering with only one asset means you use it to buy the other asset to equalize the pool to set ratio
@Unknown this is correct, it just buys for you


[07/20/2020 4:31 PM] brad.eth#8135
@blockomoco is this right https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf/status/1285228065539231744, he says that to earn CRV, you need to be in Pool 3, but Pool 1 from yieldfarming.info shows YFI and CRV being the two reward tokens from farming Pool 1


[07/20/2020 4:31 PM] blockomoco#9490
TLDR (and the intuition for that is not easy, though believe me it is as such): 
impermanent loss is the missed gains VS holding a token outside a balancer pool


[07/20/2020 4:32 PM] blockomoco#9490
if a token doubles in price and you have the token in a pool. If you take it out of the pool you will not have it doubled


[07/20/2020 4:32 PM] blockomoco#9490
it will be less than that, depending on various factors, mostly also on the weight of the token in the pool


[07/20/2020 4:33 PM] neeraj3296#8152
so basically opportunity cost it means


[07/20/2020 4:33 PM] neeraj3296#8152
and very thanks for the explanation


[07/20/2020 4:33 PM] blockomoco#9490
@Unknown you certainly also earn CRV when being in pool #1


[07/20/2020 4:33 PM] blockomoco#9490
CRV is not out yet, you just accumulate the right to get the token once the team distributed it


[07/20/2020 4:34 PM] blockomoco#9490
I think you gain that right with any Curve pool


[07/20/2020 4:34 PM] brad.eth#8135
right, makes sense thanks

[07/20/2020 4:34 PM] adrianmcli#4137
Pool 1 is the best right now IMO. There's too much uncertainty about YFI's price that you'll get wrecked by impermanent loss.


[07/20/2020 4:34 PM] blockomoco#9490
that is correct. I moved funds from pool #1 into pool #2. Yesterday evening the gains where great. Today not that great, have some loss on my funds


[07/20/2020 4:35 PM] blockomoco#9490
because the price of YFI went down a bit. Meaning if I remove my funds from pool #2 right now, I actually have loss on funds (not talking about loss on gains)

sure pool 1 is less risky, but its styll risky, and why not go max degen?


[07/20/2020 4:37 PM] blockomoco#9490
you can either sell YFI for DAI and re-invest into pool #1 or you can stake YFI into balancer for more gains

[07/20/2020 4:39 PM] psybull#4139
yes, pool 3 is the governance pool and has more requirements, plus if youre locking up your vote, you risk getting dumped on (someone else pointed out)

@psybull pool 1 is like not risky at all, what are you talking about? It's just regular Curve and a literal copy of Synthetix Mintr.


[07/20/2020 4:41 PM] psybull#4139

[07/20/2020 4:41 PM] psybull#4139
right?


[07/20/2020 4:41 PM] psybull#4139
thats still a lot of smart contract risk layered vs like, take a loan on compound just by yourself


[07/20/2020 4:42 PM] blockomoco#9490
these are hypothetical, though not impossible risks. To me it seems that Curves quality is fairly high


[07/20/2020 4:42 PM] blockomoco#9490
(compared to some other projects)


[07/20/2020 4:42 PM] adrianmcli#4137
Curve is really battle tested at this point, it's been out for a long time


[07/20/2020 4:42 PM] psybull#4139

@psybull  
You put your FYI in stake and then 1000 BPT??


[07/20/2020 4:44 PM] adrianmcli#4137
Pool 1 is only dependent on Curve + yEARN which has been out a long time and gets its yield from Compound/AAVE/dydx. All projects that have been battle tested.


[07/20/2020 4:44 PM] psybull#4139
im just sayng, if youre gonna tell someone to pick ebtwee pool 1 and 2, and youre gonna say that 1 is 'less risk' i think that you undersell the risk there


[07/20/2020 4:44 PM] psybull#4139
thats my only point


[07/20/2020 4:44 PM] adrianmcli#4137
Pool 2 and 3 has Balancer risk + impermanent loss


[07/20/2020 4:44 PM] psybull#4139
impermanace loss on a 2% pool is basically none


[07/20/2020 4:44 PM] adrianmcli#4137
these are way bigger than platform risk of Curve and yEARN (which has a much longer track record)

You earn YFI rewards for your stake.

>

@Unknown not quite. when the price of YFI drops, part of the 98% stablecoin is sold to buy more YFI.


[07/20/2020 4:58 PM] blockomoco#9490
> @blockomoco how much did you lose?
@Unknown only a few percent (like 3% or so). It is likely though that the actual loss is less and that the 3% are more like a price feed issue


[07/20/2020 5:00 PM] blockomoco#9490
that sounds right @Unknown. After all the purpose of Balancer is to keep a certain predetermined "balance"

by rewarding / panalizing certain trades balance is restored. As far as I read (may be wrong)

Just wrote a simple guide on how to do buy and stake in YFI pools


[07/20/2020 5:05 PM] blockomoco#9490
thx @weeb and arrived just in time


[07/20/2020 5:06 PM] blockomoco#9490
from that article:
```
What about the “Impermanent Loss”? Wouldn’t I lose money if YFI value dropped significantly?
Since both pool is weighted with 2% YFI, you can calculate the loss using this formula.
Lets say YFI value drops 5x then the value of your staked asset (BPT) becomes
0.2 ^ 0.02 = 0.96832378572 (3.2% decrease)
Lets say YFI value drops 10x then the value of your staked asset (BPT) becomes
0.1 ^ 0.02 = 0.95499258602 (4.5% decrease)
Lets say YFI value drops 100x then the value of your staked asset (BPT) becomes
0.01 ^ 0.02 = 0.91201083935 (8.8% decrease)
As you can see the impermanent loss is very forgiving in this setup. It allows LPs to stake with less worry about potentially losing all of their investments.
```

@weeb 

Why not recommending https://balancer.exchange/#/swap instead of referring to 1inch ? The swap UI is super simple and beginner friendly. Just a recommendation how folks can safe some fees. Because I assume that beginners may likely to go with the first and so called "easy way" (aka the 1inch recommendation).

definitely not a big deal to leave the article as is in that regard. Just nit picking 🙂 
Thx for putting in the effort 👍


[07/20/2020 7:01 PM] Polo#3333
I think I made a mistake.
I deposited DAI in curve.fi to get the ytokens but I didn't stake those in curve.fi. Instead I directly added them in pool 2 of Balancer to get BPT. Then I staked the 1000 BPT on ygov to be able to earn the fee reward from YFI.

So basically I missed the part where I stake the ytokens on ygov. I think I need to revert the process but unstaking the BPT will cost $185 of fees.
Am I correct?


[07/20/2020 7:02 PM] psybull#4139
@Unknown no you are good


[07/20/2020 7:02 PM] psybull#4139

the staking yCRV is only for people who arent going into the gov pool

he must be in pool #3


[07/20/2020 7:03 PM] psybull#4139
yeah, if you WANT to be in the gov pool, then you cant stake the yCRV in the pool1


[07/20/2020 7:03 PM] Bruckzr#9811
I got an yfi what could I do with that? Can I stake it? Where?


[07/20/2020 7:03 PM] psybull#4139
you can only be in 1 or 3

but not with the same monies


[07/20/2020 7:04 PM] Polo#3333

but the return isa bout 120%, don't expect 700-1000%


[07/20/2020 7:06 PM] Polo#3333
so you can't stake ytokens on yearn and YFI for fee rewards at the same time?

what

[07/20/2020 7:07 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777

[07/20/2020 7:10 PM] MRKWHG#0869
@Unknown to earn YFI fees, you need 1000 bpt staked in governance and have voted


[07/20/2020 7:11 PM] MRKWHG#0869
thats the requirement, with other stuff you can do whatever you want


[07/20/2020 7:11 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
ahh so that was his point


[07/20/2020 7:12 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
yes you need somethinga bove 5k in ydai crv tokens


[07/20/2020 7:12 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
staked at balancer so you receive 1000 bpt at least to stake them on ygov


[07/20/2020 7:13 PM] Polo#3333
Yes I'm in the pool 3 of balancer and I staked 1000 BPT so I'm currently earning YFI fees.
But when I click on yearn my balance is 0.00 curve.fi so I have nothing to stake, which makes me think I missed a part

@apoorv.eth  which one...pool 2 right?

Am a lil confused


[07/20/2020 7:54 PM] apoorv.eth#0001
Pool 2: 98% DAI + 2% YFI
Pool 3: 98% yCRV + 2% YFI
So you can deposit in any one of these.

5k+

you don't get crv by staking yfi

i think you should skip this alltogether 😂


[07/20/2020 9:10 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
step 1 - buy stablecoins
step 2  - supply to curve

now you earn crv


[07/20/2020 9:10 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777

[07/20/2020 9:10 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777

If the 2 in 98/2 goes too 0, we still keep the 98, right? R..r..right? 🤔

U get to keep that 98 yes


[07/20/2020 10:16 PM] Sept#0112
You keep ~90% if the price were to go down by 100x (to 10 dollars)


[07/20/2020 10:16 PM] eden#4984
You dun keep anything if one goes zero


[07/20/2020 10:16 PM] psybull#4139
basically, you sell 98% even entering the pool


[07/20/2020 10:17 PM] psybull#4139
so, you dont have much to lose either way ha


[07/20/2020 10:20 PM] Steve#7370
How much you need to add to get 1k bpt?


[07/20/2020 10:21 PM] Sept#0112

4.77k to be exact


[07/20/2020 10:23 PM] popcornkirby#7582
when do you get the BPT?


[07/20/2020 10:23 PM] Sept#0112
when you deposit your yCRV in the yCRV / YFI balancer pool


[07/20/2020 10:23 PM] dripdrop#3124
in UI it seems that YFI  rewards after we stake we can't unstake? Clicking Unstake Tokens says nothing is available to unstake even though I have YFI staked. Is that also locked by voting window? Or does "claim and unstake" button work?

what is the best way to be exposed to potential token upside in YFI, and still earn some sort of yield? stake it here: https://ygov.finance/stake  ?


[07/20/2020 10:31 PM] alx#6406
or be a liquidity provider on Uniswap's ETH/YFI pool? (I don't have a ton)


[07/20/2020 10:41 PM] dripdrop#3124

The reward you get for participating in governance is proportional to the amount of yfi you vote with right?


[07/21/2020 12:23 AM] Steve#7370
And not related to the amount you put into pool 3?


[07/21/2020 12:35 AM] tonio#8545
proportional to BPT in governance pool. rewards are proportional to YFI in rewards pool


[07/21/2020 1:57 AM] popcornkirby#7582
how do you get 1000 BPT? I staked $7k DAI in the balancer pool and only got 17 BPT


[07/21/2020 1:58 AM] psybull#4139

hey guys, I got a question. I'm hearing about "burning" YFI to claim rewards
how does that work, exactly?
i.e. how do I make sure I don't burn it?
does 'claim and unstake' burn? hope not ...

I read some tweet (that I can't find now) about people burning $1000 of YFI to claim $10 in fees
wanna make sure I, uh, don't do that, lol

[07/21/2020 3:13 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
i just add liqiduity to pool#3 by putting in ycrv and small amount of yfi. i


[07/21/2020 3:13 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
i got BPT back. when i remove liquidity do i get any of the yfi/ycrv back?


[07/21/2020 3:13 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you don't get bpt in pool #3 yet


[07/21/2020 3:13 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
ydai crv tokens and yfi are not whitelisted yet


[07/21/2020 3:13 PM] trotus#7057
Need some help with the acronyms  'AUM'


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
i got the BPT


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
i mean bal


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
sory


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] TerraBellus#4774
You're thinking BAL


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you don't get bal


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
o okok


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
so i got BPT


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
yes


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
and when i remove liquidity


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you can stake them


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] TerraBellus#4774
You get BPT


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
do i get ycrv or yfi back?


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
or basically the ycrb and yfi are exchanged into BPT


[07/21/2020 3:14 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you take the bpt


[07/21/2020 3:15 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
and stake it


[07/21/2020 3:15 PM] TerraBellus#4774
If you want the others back, withdraw liquidity

i did those


[07/21/2020 3:15 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
if you wtihdraw


[07/21/2020 3:15 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
and also the remaining yfi


[07/21/2020 3:15 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you get your riginal tokens back


[07/21/2020 3:15 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
and yfi


[07/21/2020 3:15 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
but you have to claim it


[07/21/2020 3:16 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
so we get original back when we claim it with BPT?


[07/21/2020 3:16 PM] TerraBellus#4774
If you still have yfi in your wallet you can single-asset add it to and Balancer pool


[07/21/2020 3:16 PM] J໐hຖຖฯ 🍌🍌🍌#4093
How do you put liquidity in pool 3? You need to go into Y pool in curve to get yCRV, stake that to get YFI. But the pool needs both yCRV and YFI?


[07/21/2020 3:16 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you don't stake at curve


[07/21/2020 3:16 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you only supply stablecoins there


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
but dont stake


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you stake it at balancer


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
to get bpt tokens


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] TerraBellus#4774
You may get more or less or either or both assets when withdrawing


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
to stake them at ygov


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] J໐hຖຖฯ 🍌🍌🍌#4093
but to stake YFI you need to get YFI, and that's by staking yCRV?


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] J໐hຖຖฯ 🍌🍌🍌#4093
😄


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
no


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
to stake yfi


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
you must supply 1000 bpt to ygov


[07/21/2020 3:17 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
and vote


[07/21/2020 3:18 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
so i can get my original yCRV and yfi in pool#3 when i claim it with BPT in the future? i may or may not get back same amount


[07/21/2020 3:18 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
then you can stake the yfi that you earn


[07/21/2020 3:18 PM] Yolo_Moon#4630
yes im staking my remaining YFI in governance now


[07/21/2020 3:18 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
So what does staking do on curve? Just generate YFI rewards?


[07/21/2020 3:19 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
With no voting capabilities?


[07/21/2020 3:19 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
yfi and stablecoins %


[07/21/2020 3:19 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777

hello im in pool 2, do i only get yfi as reward?


[07/21/2020 3:19 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
crv is the gov token for curve.fi


[07/21/2020 3:19 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
yfi, bal tokens and pool fees


[07/21/2020 3:20 PM] J໐hຖຖฯ 🍌🍌🍌#4093
for pool 3 do we need to suply both yCRV and YFI or just one of them?

Ugh, I seem to have lost myself in DeFi again and can't find a way out. I now own some 'crvPlain3andSUSD' (contract address: 0xC25a3A3b969415c80451098fa907EC722572917F) tokens but need to revert back to sUSD (token initially bought with) in order to trade into USDC before providing liquidity t a Y pool again.

I just can't seem to figure out how to sell back the curve tokens.

Can anyone help a girl out?


[07/21/2020 3:29 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
in pool 2


[07/21/2020 3:29 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777

@justwanttoknowathing Ah, so on Mintr?


[07/21/2020 3:30 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
You can probably unwrap them there, yes. Or curve's sUSD sub-page.


[07/21/2020 3:31 PM] nigma#4516
> You can probably unwrap them there, yes. Or curve's sUSD sub-page.
@justwanttoknowathing I'll play around with it. Thank you kindly.  :3


[07/21/2020 3:32 PM] psybull#4139
@Unknown i think this is the page you need: https://www.curve.fi/susdv2/withdraw


[07/21/2020 3:32 PM] psybull#4139
that shouldunwrap into the underlying tokens


[07/21/2020 3:33 PM] psybull#4139
then you need to trade to w/e you want

further down the rabbit hole on YFI pools!


[07/21/2020 4:00 PM] reverbb#6056
If we withdrawal from the Curve pools right now, do we miss out on receiving CRV in the future?


[07/21/2020 4:00 PM] reverbb#6056
Or do we get a "credit" to be able to claim it later?


[07/21/2020 4:04 PM] psybull#4139
my understanding is that CRV is earned by snapshot


[07/21/2020 4:04 PM] psybull#4139
but it isnt released yet, so i dont think anyting can be said with certainty


[07/21/2020 4:05 PM] psybull#4139
they said nothing was final at least a few times


[07/21/2020 4:05 PM] Ceebee111#5779
I checked ygov.finance to see my staking and rewards and it showing zero staking despite my having staked them on the zapper platform right after I joined the ycurv pool. Can anyone speak this? Thanks

did you enter the right pool for sure?


[07/21/2020 4:06 PM] psybull#4139
one thing is you might need to hard-refresh the gov page it doesnt auto-update with new chain info


[07/21/2020 4:06 PM] psybull#4139
also, check this site with your address: https://yieldfarming.info

👀 

[07/21/2020 4:39 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
You can only stake yCRV to pool #1 from Curve's site.

{Reactions}
👍 

[07/21/2020 4:39 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Does pool 1 offer governance rights??


[07/21/2020 4:39 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
For voting?


[07/21/2020 4:39 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
If you want to stake your yCRV to pool #3 (governance) you must use ygov's site.


[07/21/2020 4:39 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Ahh


[07/21/2020 4:40 PM] Ceebee111#5779
Thanks thanks.  And pool 3 gets you the same amount of YFI rewards?


[07/21/2020 4:40 PM] Ceebee111#5779
Or is it all the same


[07/21/2020 4:40 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
Each pool is distributing 10,000 YFI the first week. The rate you will get them from a pool depends on how many other people are in there with you.

{Reactions}
👍 

[07/21/2020 4:40 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
Use yieldfarming.info to get the live rate.


[07/21/2020 4:41 PM] Ceebee111#5779
Thanks a million for the info


[07/21/2020 4:42 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
How does it determine how much bpt you get per ycrv token that’s staked


[07/21/2020 4:42 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
Fixed rate.


[07/21/2020 4:43 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
When someone creates a Balancer pool they choose how much of the assets they're adding, that becomes "1 BPT". It's arbitrary.


[07/21/2020 4:43 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Oh ok


[07/21/2020 4:49 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
So if I want to generate BPT to vote how do I calculate how much ycrv I need to pool into pool 3


[07/21/2020 4:50 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Just through the conversation ratio on the yieldfarming website?


[07/21/2020 4:50 PM] TerraBellus#4774
https://yieldfarming.info/ygov_ycrv_balancer/


[07/21/2020 4:51 PM] TerraBellus#4774
That shows the current price of 1 BPT, which is $4.76


[07/21/2020 4:51 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Soooo, to vote you need about $4760 USD


[07/21/2020 4:51 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Why is that so different than pool 2 for the Dai/yfi


[07/21/2020 4:52 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Where 1 bpt = $403


[07/21/2020 4:52 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Cause Andre intended this to be the BPT used for gov I suppose.


[07/21/2020 4:52 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Specifically using pool 3 you mean?


[07/21/2020 4:52 PM] TerraBellus#4774
It uses the yCRV token so it's a positive feedback loop


[07/21/2020 4:52 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Ohhhh like to help bootstrap it


[07/21/2020 4:52 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
Ok


[07/21/2020 4:53 PM] TerraBellus#4774
It also doesn't prevent people from being able to buy into voting, but doing so would result in the inflation of the value of YFI


[07/21/2020 4:54 PM] TerraBellus#4774
As adding yCRV to the pool is the same as exchanging 2% of the value added to YFI, adds fees, etc.


[07/21/2020 5:01 PM] El Patron#9386
Why is liquidity in pool 3 is 0?


[07/21/2020 5:01 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Cause Balancer hasn't whitelisted the tokens I think.


[07/21/2020 5:08 PM] TuTrinh | VICGROUP#2789
Hi people! Please help, why now I can't add liquidity to pool 3 ? (I unlocked YFI and yCRV)

[07/21/2020 7:09 PM] mxmt#2770
Hey just to be sure: what matters if I want to farm YFI in Pool3 is the amount of BPT I'm staking correct. Staking YFI is mostly for fee rewards? So if I wanted to farm more YFI I don't need to buy more YFI, I just need to add more yCRV in the Pool to get more BPT. IS this correct?

peepoyes 

[07/21/2020 7:11 PM] eden#4984
can only farm YFI by staking BPT


[07/21/2020 7:12 PM] eden#4984
so yes youre right

[07/21/2020 7:34 PM] Alde#4128
if you claim fees from your staked YFI, is the YFI burned?


[07/21/2020 7:35 PM] zai#0518
yes 
don't


[07/21/2020 7:36 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
wrong


[07/21/2020 7:36 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
nothing gets burned when you restake your yfi


[07/21/2020 7:36 PM] Shroomfinder General#7777
unstake *


[07/21/2020 7:36 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
> can only farm YFI by staking BPT
@eden  cant you farm on curve without bpt?


[07/21/2020 7:37 PM] eden#4984
oh yes pool 1


[07/21/2020 7:37 PM] psybull#4139
hold on


[07/21/2020 7:37 PM] eden#4984
always forgot pool 1


[07/21/2020 7:37 PM] psybull#4139
no burning YFI from claim in pool 4?


[07/21/2020 7:37 PM] psybull#4139
correct?


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] eden#4984
no - but i havent tried it myself


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] aeto#9504
someone try it


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] psybull#4139
theres no way this is the SNX contract it doesnt burn shit


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] aeto#9504
for science


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] psybull#4139
ill read it


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] eden#4984
it refers to the "Fee Rewards" contract


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] Alde#4128
i saw on twitter that your yfi gets burned if you claim fees


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] psybull#4139
that was the old system


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] psybull#4139
that andre disabled from UI


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] psybull#4139
some not so smart people did it


[07/21/2020 7:38 PM] eden#4984
there are "Rewards" contract and "Fee Rewards" contract


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] psybull#4139
FEE REWARDS, im saying, does NOT burn your YFI to claim


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] psybull#4139
but i will verify


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] psybull#4139
since i dont know 100%


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] eden#4984
i think the former burns your yfi - again not sure DYOR


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] Alde#4128
thanks @psybull


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] Alde#4128
thanks @eden


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] eden#4984
so i think the socalled pool 4 does NOT burn your yfi


[07/21/2020 7:39 PM] eden#4984
again DYOR


[07/21/2020 7:40 PM] Alde#4128
what does the pool have to do with it?


[07/21/2020 7:40 PM] Alde#4128
staked YFI collects fees


[07/21/2020 7:40 PM] Alde#4128
is that pool 4?


[07/21/2020 7:40 PM] aeto#9504
yes that is pool 4


[07/21/2020 7:41 PM] aeto#9504
but no one has verified that "claim rewards" does not burn staked YFI


[07/21/2020 7:41 PM] eden#4984
check pool 4 contract address, then check the contract on etherscan people


[07/21/2020 7:41 PM] aeto#9504
although if this is the same as mintr, then nothing gets burned


[07/21/2020 7:42 PM] aeto#9504
there's also the "claim and unstake" option which also suggests nothing gets burned


[07/21/2020 7:50 PM] psybull#4139
welcome to STONED solidity, where my high-ass javascript developer attempts to explain code to you lot:

Today we look at the [getReward() function from the Fee Rewards pool4 smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb01419e74d8a2abb1bbad82925b19c36c191a701#code)

```
function getReward() public updateReward(msg.sender) {
    if (breaker == false) {
        require(yGov.balanceOf(msg.sender) > minimum, "<minimum");
        require(yGov.voteLock(msg.sender) > block.number, "<block.number");
    }
```

this is some function and inheritance declaration bullshit we dont care about

I dont totally know what `breaker` is, but its comparing minimum values and block numebrs, so its more like some sanity checks than anything to do with burning

```
    uint256 reward = earned(msg.sender);
    if (reward > 0) {
        rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
        yCRV.safeTransfer(msg.sender, reward);
        emit RewardPaid(msg.sender, reward);
    }
}
```

This is the part we care about, which is that, if the TX sender has a reward value greater than 0, it `safeTransfers` that amount to the sender, in yCRV, then `emits` the event

I dont see anything in that code that woudl burn, but DYOR and see if i explained it well!

[07/21/2020 7:54 PM] aeto#9504
`yCRV.safeTransfer` actually burns YFI


[07/21/2020 7:54 PM] psybull#4139
hmmm, maybe theres a followup episode about `safeTransfer` but its not a burn function


[07/21/2020 7:55 PM] psybull#4139

Haha, no, you did great.


[07/21/2020 7:56 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
If you look elsewhere in that code I'm sure yCRV is the yDAI+yUSDC+etc. token, `safeTransfer()` is usually a safer version of `transfer()` which is a standard erc20 function.

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[07/21/2020 7:56 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
That just zeros out your owed reward and sends you your reward.


[07/21/2020 7:57 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
(Unless Andre's decided on _now_ to be evil and `safeTransfer()` does something odd. That'd be one hell of a choice at this point, though.)


[07/21/2020 7:57 PM] psybull#4139
well, yeah ok barring a camoflage booby trap

[07/21/2020 7:59 PM] zai#0518
if you looked at transactions of people burning YFI to get aDai, would that help ? I guess the code got changed since then?

that usually means you are doing something wrong

you don't have to vote to stake tho


[07/21/2020 11:14 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Yes sorry I should have clarified. This is for pool too. Don’t have the full 1000 yet just checking it all out first. I checked the token contract and it’s the right one.


[07/21/2020 11:15 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Sorry, for the balancer pool not the governance


[07/21/2020 11:17 PM] Kendrick Llama#1532
if you got pool 2 BPT already then it could be borked MetaMask, restart your browser and try again please


[07/21/2020 11:24 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Okay let me back up. I added liquidity to pool #3 and received BPT in metamask (custom added it from the contract address). My metamask is connected to ygov, but it is not showing any BPT balance in the ygov dashboard. I tried restarting the browser and it is still asking for .79 Eth as gas. This happens when I am trying to manually input the amount of BPT in the dashboard. Does that make sense?


[07/21/2020 11:39 PM] TerraBellus#4774
You see the BPT token in your wallet on etherscan?


[07/21/2020 11:40 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Yes. It’s showing up in Metamask and etherscan


[07/21/2020 11:40 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Is there a minimum?


[07/21/2020 11:41 PM] TerraBellus#4774
This token: 0x95C4B6C7CfF608c0CA048df8b81a484aA377172B ?


[07/21/2020 11:41 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Yes that’s the one


[07/21/2020 11:43 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Do you have 1000+?


[07/21/2020 11:44 PM] fittytigsic#1690
No I don’t. But do I need that if I am not trying to stake in the governance platform and only the balancer platform through ygov?


[07/21/2020 11:44 PM] TerraBellus#4774
They should appear under https://ygov.finance/stake


[07/21/2020 11:45 PM] TerraBellus#4774
As in, under the balancer "tab"

@Unknown  I have the same issue trying to deposit yCurve. Stakes through Curve so not a big deal but still, doesn’t recognise tokens in wallet.


[07/22/2020 12:03 AM] fittytigsic#1690
Hmm. If is would go through without the crazy amount of gas it wouldn't be an issue for me. I am now seeing a different BPT in my wallet which shows that Ygov is interacting with it, but the balance is 0. I just don't understand why this is happening. It showed up in my wallet after adding liquidity to the balancer pool.


[07/22/2020 12:04 AM] fittytigsic#1690
> @Unknown  I have the same issue trying to deposit yCurve. Stakes through Curve so not a big deal but still, doesn’t recognise tokens in wallet.
@Unknown Did you have to manually adjust gas price? I tried to adjust it to a normal amount, but it shot an error message.


[07/22/2020 12:05 AM] mimi#5164
> @Unknown Did you have to manually adjust gas price? I tried to adjust it to a normal amount, but it shot an error message.
@Unknown  As it didn’t recognise my tokens I had nothing to try and stake so not sure about gas price. Spent around $50 string through Curve


[07/22/2020 12:08 AM] fittytigsic#1690
Should I maybe try to remove the liquidity from the pool, re-add it, and try again?


[07/22/2020 12:11 AM] TerraBellus#4774
Could do. RIP fees though.


[07/22/2020 12:12 AM] TerraBellus#4774

[07/22/2020 12:15 AM] fittytigsic#1690
Okay I was able to stake through the governance link. However, I wont see any rewards from having fewer than 1000 and staking there, right?

I'm looking at the yfi->ycrv fee rewards contract and can't find anything about yfi token locked until block n.  Can you unstake the yfi at any time or do you have to wait a certain amount of time?

what a peculiar design. it encourages waiting as long as possible before claiming


[07/22/2020 10:22 AM] sadcat#1111
on further thought, it provides a constantly rising price floor

I don’t see why staking to earn fees wouldn’t be a better mechanism

Low yfi price encourages purchasing as fees go up just like any other p/e type scenario


[07/22/2020 10:26 AM] sadcat#1111
it's a hard price floor because lower price is going to get arbitraged, which I think is a unique design. could be memable

@sadcat for plebs like me I think it might be ok to mitigate high gas fees. If I wait and claim a bigger amount.


[07/22/2020 11:20 AM] eden#4984
YFI price would be constantly (slightly?) higher than claimable value, w/ the expectation of ALWAYS being able to claim more later. So few would really burn YFI and claim. So in turn YFI price is backed by those claimable values.
If we cap YFI supply, and fee continues to accumulate, you know what that means


[07/22/2020 11:45 AM] esk#5889
@Kendrick Llama Any idea how "burn for fees" will be reintroduced? Like, if you have YFI already staked for rewards will you be able to unstake using the old method, or will it be automatically converted to the burn method?


[07/22/2020 12:13 PM] Kendrick Llama#1532
not sure, I'm waiting for info


[07/22/2020 12:30 PM] blockomoco#9490
is there a way to see how many YFI are left to farm in each of the pools ?


[07/22/2020 12:35 PM] blockomoco#9490
in terms of collecting leverage for the upcoming CRV token distribution, does it make a difference if one is on pool 1 or pool 3 ?


[07/22/2020 12:37 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
1 is 100% yCRV, 3 is 98% yCRV. You will get 2% less CRV by using 3 over 1.


[07/22/2020 12:37 PM] blockomoco#9490
ok 👍 does the trading volume in the pools have an impact for the CRV distribution ?


[07/22/2020 12:39 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
No. Trading volume against the y pool makes your yCRV tokens go up in value. Trade volume against any of the balancer pools makes your YFI go up (incredibly slightly) in value.


[07/22/2020 12:40 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
As far as the YFI ecosystem is concerned, your CRV rewards are dictated solely by your yCRV balance, regardless of where you store them.


[07/22/2020 12:40 PM] blockomoco#9490
this is good info 🙂 thx @justwanttoknowathing


[07/22/2020 1:02 PM] Djcarlos000#6476

what does it do for the economics thats helpful other than reduce supply?

[07/22/2020 4:54 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Question about CRV token rewards: (Asked in Curve discord support channel, but would like further clarification here)

Given an LP deposits into Curve and receives yCRV tokens to their ETH address, I can see how Curve will track that the LP provided liquidity over a certain time period.  But once the LP stakes the yCRV into the Balancer pool, it now lives at the address of the balancer pool contract.  How does the CRV reward come to the LP in that situation?

In Curve discord I got the response:
[20:47] Charlie: @Unknown yearn will have to distribute which means distribution might be delayed or different.

So this implies that yearn has access to ERC20 tokens (e.g CRV) sent to the balancer pool address and can then distribute them to us? Have I understood right? Or missed anything?


[07/22/2020 4:59 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Andre has the ability to take those CRV tokens from the contract address and release them for distribution somehow.


[07/22/2020 5:00 PM] TerraBellus#4774
How they're distributed is probably a matter for governance.


[07/22/2020 5:05 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Thanks.  So he has the ability to take them as he created the pool, and thus can call the normal ERC20 methods such as transfer etc on the contract?   Sorry if this is obvious, but it's difficult to see the whole picture sometimes!


[07/22/2020 5:06 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Gonna go look at the pool contract on etherscan to see if I can get my head around it.


[07/22/2020 5:09 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Yeah. He does it manually for now.


[07/22/2020 5:18 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Yeah still struggling to understand this.   So once CRV launches it will be a ERC20 token, and an amount will be distributed to the YFI, yCRV pool address in the CRV contract.  But in order to move that CRV, Andre would need to control that address, but I assume (rightly or wrongly) that the pool address is not controlled by him (.i.e he does not have the private key).

Not saying there is a problem, as this all will have been put together by people who know what they are doing... Just wish I could get my head around how it works.


[07/22/2020 5:21 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
Any CRV sent to the yCRV/YFI pool will be lost forever.


[07/22/2020 5:21 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
Andre or our governance will have to talk to the Curve folks to have them send it elsewhere so he/we can distribute it.


[07/22/2020 5:22 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Andre does have the keys to that function, as far as I know. He just transferred ownership of the minting function to the multisig.


[07/22/2020 5:23 PM] TerraBellus#4774
@justwanttoknowathing likely knows far better than I, however 😄

[07/22/2020 5:25 PM] Djcarlos000#6476
can somebody guide me??


[07/22/2020 5:30 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Unstaking + claiming does not equate to burning for rewards


[07/22/2020 5:37 PM] Djcarlos000#6476
Thanks, in which case the FYI are burned??


[07/22/2020 5:38 PM] TerraBellus#4774
The mechanics of the ecosystem allow for a burning mechanism by which accrued fees can be acquired by burning YFI. Doing so at this stage would be a very unprofitable move, however, so Andre removed it.


[07/22/2020 5:39 PM] TerraBellus#4774
Somebody burned about $1200 worth of YFI and got back about $0.30 in accrued system fees.

@Unknown hmm okey, can we clear this up and get confirmation on it?
It was only the minting function that was put into the multisig?


[07/22/2020 6:49 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
There _are_ no keys for that function. The balancer pool contract is just a balancer pool: once made into a public pool it has no functions to remove non-balanced ERC20s that find their way into the contract.

> The mechanics of the ecosystem allow for a burning mechanism by which accrued fees can be acquired by burning YFI. Doing so at this stage would be a very unprofitable move, however, so Andre removed it.
@Unknown for instance, if I unstaked my BPT from pool 3 and moved my liquidity to another pool, it would not burn YFI? or it would?


[07/22/2020 7:55 PM] thierbig#6081
@_acap so no CRV rewards will be offered ever from that ppol


[07/22/2020 7:56 PM] _acap#6983
you're earning crv from the ycrv tokens.  You're basically earning crv, bal, and yfi + trade fees

@Unknown crv isn't released yet so you won't see that accumulate.  bal deposited weekly, trade fees on bal provided when you exit, yfi claimable in dashboard

[07/23/2020 5:18 AM] CanCOKE#4573
Question about CRV token rewards:
Given an LP deposits into Curve and receives yCRV tokens to their ETH address, I can see how Curve will track that the LP provided liquidity over a certain time period.  But once the LP stakes the yCRV into the Balancer pool, it now lives at the address of the balancer pool contract.  How does the CRV reward come to the LP in that situation?


[07/23/2020 5:20 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
@CanCOKE It's also been confirmed that those providing their yCRV to the third Balancer pool will be eligible to receive CRV rewards retroactively once it launches. However the mechanics of how those CRV can be claimed will depend on further development of the Yearn protocol.


[07/23/2020 5:20 AM] CanCOKE#4573
Oh, There are already questions and answers upstairs. Sorry

HI all. Can I check if say for YFI-yCRV, what is 21. withdraw in the smart contract do?


[07/23/2020 7:22 AM] Blackthorne#6730
#support i'm a tad confused about the fee rewards for pool 3. darren lau said in his twitter post that you use the y-gov tokens that you get from pool 3 to earn the yCRV rewards. are those the same as the YFi tokens?


[07/23/2020 7:22 AM] TerraBellus#4774
No


[07/23/2020 7:23 AM] TerraBellus#4774
YFI=y-gov tokens


[07/23/2020 7:23 AM] Blackthorne#6730
ok yes so they are the same then


[07/23/2020 7:23 AM] TerraBellus#4774
yCRV=paid as fee rewards


[07/23/2020 7:24 AM] Blackthorne#6730
can i claim Yfi multiple times from the same pool?


[07/23/2020 7:24 AM] Blackthorne#6730
are people claiming their YFi every day or two and then re-staking into the fee reward pool?


[07/23/2020 7:24 AM] TerraBellus#4774
yCRV are pooled DAI/USDC/TUSD/USDT wrapped in yearn's own interest earning contracts


[07/23/2020 7:25 AM] Blackthorne#6730
yes i get that


[07/23/2020 7:25 AM] TerraBellus#4774
If you have a large stack of YFI and you want to sell/stake for yCRV rewards (after meeting the criteria) it makes sense to claim them regularly.


[07/23/2020 7:26 AM] Blackthorne#6730
ok good deal. thx. 👍


[07/23/2020 7:27 AM] Blackthorne#6730

and whats the difference between  balancer and governance rewards? confusing


[07/23/2020 8:06 AM] TerraBellus#4774
1) Because it's good for pumpamentals
2) gov rewards assumes you're staking 1000+ BPT to qualify for a portion of the fees accrued by the system and not just YFI


[07/23/2020 8:07 AM] angel222#5411
Hi guys, i'm trying to unstake my BPT from the Governance pool, but I am unable to unstake, with the message "Unstaking tokens only allowed once all your pending votes have closed at Block: 10524429".


[07/23/2020 8:08 AM] angel222#5411
However, there are definitely no votes that end at block 10524429, and I only voted for proposal 1 which ended a day ago. So what's going on here?


[07/23/2020 8:09 AM] TerraBellus#4774
That lock is determined by when you voted, not when the poll ended.


[07/23/2020 8:10 AM] TerraBellus#4774

Hi fellows, just get a question about curve's Y pool. Suppose I want to swap USDT to USDC, then by using Y pool, I may take the route USDT - yUSDT -yUSDC - USDC? If that's the case, why don't I just use USDT/USDC pool to accomplish the swap?

@Unknown can use sUSD pool, a non-lending pool for USDT/USDC and save gas cost. Just a matter of which pool will have more liquidity to reduce the most slippage

@Kendrick Llama Thanks:) So i guess it basically depends on the amount of coins swapped to decide which factor, slippage or gas fee outweighs?

I think the contracts will empty of their rewards sequentially.


[07/23/2020 1:24 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Quick question. If I am staking my BPT in the governance pool, can I claim my YFI and re-enter it into the BAL pool to create more BPT? I don't quite have 1000 yet, but I would like to grow my stack. I have heard that there is/is not a burning mechanism anymore, and I just wanted to clarify this. Thanks!


[07/23/2020 1:26 PM] eden#4984
yes you can, but beware of gas price


[07/23/2020 1:27 PM] eden#4984
burning mechanism is still here, altho not accessible via the website


[07/23/2020 1:28 PM] fittytigsic#1690
Okay, gotcha. So it would likely be something to consider after farming for a decent stack? In this scenario, at what point would the YFI be burned?

The tokens have to be locked, i.e. 3 days.

Andre describes YFI as “0 financial value” token. 
"
In further efforts to give up this control (mostly because we are lazy and don’t want to do it), we have released YFI, a completely valueless 0 supply token. We re-iterate, it has 0 financial value. There is no pre-mine, there is no sale, no you cannot buy it, no, it won’t be on uniswap, no, there won’t be an auction. We don’t have any of it.

[07/23/2020 11:33 PM] Sept#0112
YFI is the token for the yearn protocol


[07/23/2020 11:33 PM] Libertarian Salvation#9271
" If the token is infinitely minted, a huge percent of the entire Dai supply can be stolen. "


[07/23/2020 11:36 PM] Sept#0112
Yeah if the yearn unaudited protocol were exploited it could mint infinite YFI and drain the pool of a hundred million in DAI


[07/23/2020 11:44 PM] Libertarian Salvation#9271
It´s sounds very weird.  A valueless token that worth $1,724,00 US dollar each YFI token.  A big warning on Balancer that I never saw in other pools.   Ultra high APY displayed on Curve.fi.   No official support.  What am I missing?

@AlphaTraderJoe great summary. Love this community!


[07/24/2020 12:12 AM] Libertarian Salvation#9271
@AlphaTraderJoe hm....so it´s a multi-sign that can control mining YFI.  And other governance stuffs as well.


[07/24/2020 12:19 AM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
drop it in curve for ycrv tokens


[07/24/2020 12:19 AM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
then stake those or put them on balancer


[07/24/2020 12:22 AM] AlphaTraderJoe#0284
@Libertarian Salvation yeap, for now YFI is capped at 30k, but the community is working on proposals and will vote on what the future supply and incentives will be like.... after the voting, i assume the signers will act in line with the votes...


[07/24/2020 12:23 AM] Libertarian Salvation#9271
@AlphaTraderJoe All right. Thank you.

Hi! Is it just me or are others also having trouble adding liquidity to Balancer? I push "Add Liquidity" and it no tx request is sent to metamask, strange


[07/24/2020 2:45 AM] Ceebee111#5779
Hi, when I stake yfi and then unstake do I get back the yfi in original yfi form?

And the second round starting time will be further announced?


[07/24/2020 3:02 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
yes everyone is waiting for that, emission rates are still being worked on


[07/24/2020 3:04 AM] mjp.sol#1082
But we still get ycrv given to us if we remain in pool 3 after yfi emission ends?


[07/24/2020 3:05 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
you mean CRV or yCRV?


[07/24/2020 3:06 AM] blockomoco#9490
the person probably means CRV, since pool 3 does not provide yCRV rewards


[07/24/2020 3:07 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
then yes you will still receive CRV because you are holding Curve LP tokens from y pool on Curve


[07/24/2020 3:07 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
However the mechanics of how those CRV can be claimed will depend on further development of the Yearn protocol.


[07/24/2020 3:08 AM] blockomoco#9490
what about pool 1


[07/24/2020 3:08 AM] blockomoco#9490
are the mechanics there more clear or same (to be determined)


[07/24/2020 3:08 AM] blockomoco#9490
referring to the Curve based pool, the Y pool


[07/24/2020 3:10 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
for pool 1 no worry about that, you will claim CRV from Curve when it's online

👍 ✨ 

[07/24/2020 3:11 AM] mamajuana!pink#4141
I thought pool 1 only gives you yields plus YFI tokens?


[07/24/2020 3:12 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
pool 1 is y pool on Curve and you farm CRV with it too


[07/24/2020 3:12 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
yield on yield bruh


[07/24/2020 3:13 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
pool 1 (y pool): YFI + CRV (soon) + APY


[07/24/2020 3:14 AM] mamajuana!pink#4141
Oh I see so not yet CRV but will have soon


[07/24/2020 3:15 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
yes it's pro-rata for CRV


[07/24/2020 3:16 AM] mamajuana!pink#4141
Base on what to prorate


[07/24/2020 3:16 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
your liquidity / total liquidity in Curve over time


[07/24/2020 3:16 AM] mamajuana!pink#4141
Staking amount / pool total?


[07/24/2020 3:16 AM] mamajuana!pink#4141

Hi all, I'm facing some issues adding liquidity to pool3 on Balancer. I had limited the amount of yCRV that could be withdrawn from my wallet when I was adding to the pool before. Now when I try to add more liquidity by unlocking my wallet, no tx request is thrown up to my metamask. I'm not sure how to resolve this--noone on Balancer discord is able to help, any idea how to resolve this?


[07/24/2020 3:49 AM] blockomoco#9490
if you suspect a metamask issue, worth trying on another browser


[07/24/2020 3:49 AM] blockomoco#9490
there, you would have a clean state what metamask is concerned


[07/24/2020 3:50 AM] blockomoco#9490
metamask works well for me on both firefox and chrome


[07/24/2020 3:50 AM] blockomoco#9490
(so that you should be ok trying out one or the other)


[07/24/2020 3:50 AM] Oodges#0367
does balancer support any wallets that can be secured via trezor?


[07/24/2020 3:50 AM] blockomoco#9490
works via metamask @Unknown


[07/24/2020 3:51 AM] blockomoco#9490
you can add your trezor there, and then connect to balancer via metamask

[07/24/2020 4:25 AM] Oodges#0367
So far so good,    when I want to then see my yCRV balance on metamask,  i need to specify the contract address and number of decimals,    is that  0xdF5e0e81Dff6FAF3A7e52BA697820c5e32D806A8   and 18?


[07/24/2020 4:25 AM] Oodges#0367
@mxmt   fee rewards for which pool?


[07/24/2020 4:25 AM] mxmt#2770
Pool 3


[07/24/2020 4:26 AM] mxmt#2770
For staking YFI in Ygov.finance


[07/24/2020 4:26 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
staking YFI is pool 4


[07/24/2020 4:27 AM] Oodges#0367
"Pool #3 BPT (98% yCRV 2% YFI) staking pool
Earns y curve fees, lending fees, and balancer fees. Earns BAL, CRV, YFI as rewards. Owning more than 1000 BPT (yCRV 2% YFI) grants you ability to stake YFI to earn yCRV."

[07/24/2020 4:27 AM] mxmt#2770
Oh yeah right. I do have over 1001 BPT staked so I guess I'm in POol4

@Kendrick Llama   I withdrew 100 yCRV from Curve to my metamask, and saw it there briefly,  without my asking it seems to have broken my CRV into its constituent yDAI yUSDT .....   ,  before I had the chance to add it to balancer  is that expected behaviour?


[07/24/2020 4:58 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
sounds like you chose to withdraw wrapped version which you should not


[07/24/2020 4:58 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
because when you deposit to y pool you will receive Curve LP tokens for y pool to your MetaMask wallet address already


[07/24/2020 5:00 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
you can go back to deposit page https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit then choose to deposit wrapped to get back the correct Curve LP tokens

What are the advantages / disadvantages of adding single asset yCRV to the Balancer pool,  or doing the 98%/2% split?


[07/24/2020 5:20 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532
there is slippage but . won't be this much at the current liquidity


[07/24/2020 5:38 AM] Oodges#0367
ok thx


[07/24/2020 5:55 AM] Oodges#0367
After adding the yCRV to the balancer pool is there anything needed to be done to harvest the BAL tokens?


[07/24/2020 5:59 AM] Oodges#0367
Or is that Bal pool not yet considered eligible for BAL

I want to  deposite my satble token(DAI). But my metamask can’t press “approve “button.

I went to deposite page(https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit )
and connect my metamask (firefox)
then, my stable token(DAI) display on webpage. 

I had checked.
[x]Add all coins in a balanced proportion
[x]Use maximum amount of coins available

then press , “deposite” button.

Please approve spending your coins  is showing.

I want approve metamask. But I cant.
Please tell me how to deal with it..

I"m having some trouble figuring out how to remove liquidity from the balancer pool


[07/24/2020 7:24 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
"governance pool"


[07/24/2020 7:25 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
I did single asset withdrawl as YFI, and I get why that doesn't work... cause it' can't calculate a percent based on "max"


[07/24/2020 7:25 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
but that is a problem for withdrawing ytokens too


[07/24/2020 7:25 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
so.... how to get out of balancer pool?


[07/24/2020 7:26 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
basically, I want to remove liquidity to buy more yfi


[07/24/2020 7:29 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Since you are only depositing only DAI and not all 4 coins equally, you probably need to deselect "Add all coins in a balanced proportion" - Perhaps metamask can't approve as you don't own those coins.


[07/24/2020 7:30 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
@Unknown any idea?


[07/24/2020 7:31 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
just remove as single asset y tokens?


[07/24/2020 7:31 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
then redeem via curve?


[07/24/2020 7:31 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
but bit tricky to calculate percentage


[07/24/2020 7:33 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown sorry, not sure.  But " I get why that doesn't work... cause it' can't calculate a percent based on "max"" doesn't make sense to me.  I think withdrawing via single / multiple,  should just give you your proportionate share back in the ratio of the pool.  Perhaps someone else could chime in....


[07/24/2020 7:33 AM] OxRichGenius (∞)#9194
yeah, so I did that for YFI, but it totally didn't work


[07/24/2020 7:33 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
In what way did it not work? Error message? what happened?


[07/24/2020 7:34 AM] winter_is_cold#0901
@Unknown  many thanks. but not work.. and i noticed. maybe my metamask eth is not enough amount.  i converted all eth to DAI.


[07/24/2020 7:34 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown That sounds like it, catches me out sometimes, check your eth balance


[07/24/2020 8:00 AM] winter_is_cold#0901
@Unknown 　I can approved metamask. Because of lack of eth amount. thanks you very much.


[07/24/2020 8:31 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
Hopefully someone can help with a problem I have. I just removed some USDC from the Y pool, and then observed that the remaining balance in the pool was less than I expected. I discovered that somehow I ended up with missing amount sitting in Metamask, in the form of the combo-token (USDC/DAI/USDT/TUSD). In the Curve UI, I can't figure out how to re-dollarize (?) that to put it back in the pool, or otherwise how to fix this.

I'm at ygov.finance, trying to stake my YFI, but haven't satisfied the BPT requirement and the UI just assumes the user knows what that means. Is there some documentation somewhere that describes how I acquire 1k BPT and then how to stake it in the governance pool?


[07/24/2020 9:04 AM] roccosplorer#7711
Only pool#2 (YFI/DAI Balancer) is now giving YFI rewards? Or also pool#3?


[07/24/2020 9:36 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown The BPT token referred to is the token balancer gives you in return for staking liquidity in their pools. Confusing point is that every balancer pool gives back a distinct type of BPT token, but they are all referred to as BPT.  When you deposit liquidity into the pool, in return the BPT will come to your address.


[07/24/2020 9:37 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
Hi again — I deposited 3 YFI using the single asset method, that then splits into the respective pool components. I received 8 BPT (as reported in the wallet balances area of Balancer.) That'd suggest needing to deposit $750k of YFI to get 1000 BPT.


[07/24/2020 9:38 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
You got the ether transaction url?


[07/24/2020 9:38 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459

[07/24/2020 9:39 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Thats true


[07/24/2020 9:39 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440

[07/24/2020 9:41 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459

[07/24/2020 9:41 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
The calculated price of the BPT right now is $4.85, so.... to get 1000 should cost only around $4850

[07/24/2020 9:41 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459

@Unknown in order to get this BPT, we need to deposit 80%/20% ycrv/yfi?


[07/24/2020 9:42 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
The balancer deposit tx should show the BPT coming back to your address

80%yCRV/20%YFI if I read correctly

@Unknown Rather than doing the single asset, I'll remove $5k in yCRV. Do you know how to do that? I know how to remove dollars from the pool, but not yCRV.

[07/24/2020 9:51 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
you should see it there at least.


[07/24/2020 9:52 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Some wallets won't show BPT unless you manually add it with the contract address.  Cant explain the stake UI not showing it through. Try reloading?


[07/24/2020 9:52 AM] Speedy#1121
If you deposit YFI as single asset will I get back the same value of YFI if remove it from liquidity?


[07/24/2020 9:52 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
Ah, do you happen to have the contract address?

I have a question,where can I see the pool's situation,I heard the pool1 YFI is finished,so where can I see how much YFI left in the pools


[07/24/2020 10:00 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
@Unknown OK, I did it again, and manually added the BPT token to my Metamask wallet. Now I see 1000 BPT tokens.


[07/24/2020 10:00 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440

[07/24/2020 10:00 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459

@Unknown OK


[07/24/2020 10:03 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
OK Graham, the problem before was, I though the staking process at ygov required you to be holding 1000 BPT. I didn't realize you needed to perform another action at ygov first, i.e. the staking of the 1000 BPT tokens.


[07/24/2020 10:05 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Ah ok.


[07/24/2020 10:05 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
I presume jumping through all these hoops to stake my YFI is worth it. 🙂


[07/24/2020 10:06 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
I actually don't know what I'm going to earn (more YFI?), when earnings come in, etc. 🙂


[07/24/2020 10:10 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Well pool 3 rewards end on Sunday and vote is underway to determine future schedule of rewards.

Is "pool 3" where YFI coins get sent when staking them at ygov.finance?


[07/24/2020 10:12 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Sorry not vote, but discussion, vote soon


[07/24/2020 10:13 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Pool 3 in the balancer pool.  YFI coins will accumulate at https://ygov.finance/stake where you can claim / stake


[07/24/2020 10:13 AM] aaaaaaaaaa#7020
hey where can I see current pools distribution rates?


[07/24/2020 10:13 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Ah sorry, misread


[07/24/2020 10:15 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown staking YFI there, gives you some yCRV, see https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/yfi_ycrv/#  - YFI accumulation is seen at https://ygov.finance/stake as reward for depositing into balancer pool 3


[07/24/2020 10:17 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
@Unknown I've successfully staked the BPT and the YFI. That yieldfarming URL is showing everything successfully.


[07/24/2020 10:18 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Excellent, the rewards  are not too high for that, little bit of yCRV.  Biggest reward is the YFI reward for being in the balancer pool, which ends some time on Sunday.


[07/24/2020 10:18 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
yieldfarming link above will show you your rewards if you connect metamask


[07/24/2020 10:19 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
The balancer pool rewards end Sunday. OK. The Curve pool rewards I understand do NOT end on Sunday (as originally planned?)


[07/24/2020 10:20 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
I'm not aware of curve pool rewards ending, they haven't even released the CRV token yet, difficult to keep up with this all though


[07/24/2020 10:21 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
unless you mean the rewards from yearn, im which case then I believe they end today


[07/24/2020 10:21 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
I mean the YFI rewards paid out to the main YFI pool. I understood that's called the "Curve" pool.


[07/24/2020 10:21 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
Yeah, yearn. 🙂


[07/24/2020 10:21 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
My god.


[07/24/2020 10:21 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
My understand in that is referred to as pool 1 and rewards ended today


[07/24/2020 10:21 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
I'm really struggling to keep all these dimensions straight.


[07/24/2020 10:21 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440

[07/24/2020 10:27 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Possible until some time on Sunday., Then again later once a vote is passed on new schedule.


[07/24/2020 10:34 AM] madye#2563
now that pool 1 is finished, is unstaking from curve and using the yCRV in pool 3 the easiest way to get to a new pool?


[07/24/2020 10:35 AM] Shebee82#4127
Admin are there directions how to deposit in Pool 4?


[07/24/2020 10:37 AM] madye#2563
curve.fi = yCRV correct?


[07/24/2020 10:37 AM] roccosplorer#7711
When do Pool #2 rewards end?


[07/24/2020 10:42 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@madye yes. not sure what you are asking in 2nd question through


[07/24/2020 10:43 AM] madye#2563
@Unknown in ygov.finance/stake the yCRV are showing as curve.fi unless I'm truly misunderstanding how all of this works


[07/24/2020 10:44 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Depositing stable coins into the curve y pool, will return you yCRV tokens.


[07/24/2020 10:46 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
This will show up in the curve.fi/y section on ygov.finance


[07/24/2020 10:46 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
(and also in your wallet of course)


[07/24/2020 10:47 AM] madye#2563
All I did was "deposit and stake"  www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit and that I assume got me into pool 1. Now I can go to the same link and unstake, which will give me yCRV tokens I can stake in pool 3


[07/24/2020 10:47 AM] madye#2563
unless I'm wrong


[07/24/2020 10:48 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
That sounds right, i've not gone via pool 1, I just deposited (not and staked) into curve y pool, then took my ycrv off to pool 3. But what you are describing sounds correct.


[07/24/2020 10:49 AM] madye#2563
cool thanks mate


[07/24/2020 10:49 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
@Unknown Now that I've staked my BPT, can I close out my participation in the yCRV/YFI pool at Balancer, or does that have to remain active?


[07/24/2020 10:49 AM] Shebee82#4127
@Unknown can you please clarify how to deposit in pool #4 that only benefits from transaction fees?


[07/24/2020 10:50 AM] Shebee82#4127
For YFI farming

> @Unknown Now that I've staked my BPT, can I close out my participation in the yCRV/YFI pool at Balancer, or does that have to remain active?
@Unknown you can't get out of that balancer pool, as that requires swapping your BPT tokens back for your liquidity, but you're BPT tokens are staked in yearn.


[07/24/2020 10:50 AM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
Gottit. Thanks.


[07/24/2020 10:52 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
> @Unknown can you please clarify how to deposit in pool #4 that only benefits from transaction fees?
@Unknown See "Pool #4 YFI staking reward pool" at https://medium.com/@Weeb_Mcgee/yfi-explained-by-weeb-90a4e545aa3e


[07/24/2020 10:55 AM] Shebee82#4127
Merci!


[07/24/2020 10:55 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Not sure if its worth it unless you have a lot of YFI. APY is currently 20% in yCRV tokens,  I did it recently, but the cost of gas can cancel out the benefits.


[07/24/2020 10:57 AM] Shebee82#4127
I have alot of YFI. I can’t stake my YFI elsewhere can I?

[07/24/2020 1:35 PM] fel#8415
Correct, no more YFI for pool 1.  You still accrue some curve rewards


[07/24/2020 1:40 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
do they need staked to accrue CRV rewards though?


[07/24/2020 1:41 PM] mr.stegosaurus#8066
i thought you only need to deposit coins into a pool. so ycrv tokens unstaked should still accrue crv rewards?


[07/24/2020 1:41 PM] Blackthorne#6730
i've been wondering exact same question


[07/24/2020 1:42 PM] Blackthorne#6730
doesn't really say on the curve page that they do, but have seen it implied elsewhere that crv rewards are accumulating...


[07/24/2020 2:10 PM] _therealreal#0762

note that he numbers also contain unclaimed rewards. Which is why there still is 579 YFI assigned to pool 1

hello. i followed the instructions written in a blog and arrived here


[07/24/2020 6:48 PM] Benfield#4056
i swapped eth for dai, and then i staked my dai to get curvy, then i staked my curvy to get yif and i find that they arent giving the yif which means ive got to unstake my curvy to get my curvy back and then swap my curvy for dai and then my dai back in to eth.


[07/24/2020 6:48 PM] Benfield#4056
id rather not do that and waste another $50 on gas fees so can i know when yif payouts will resume on the curvy staking to get yif pool?

[07/24/2020 6:52 PM] Benfield#4056
curve.fi?


[07/24/2020 6:56 PM] mjp.sol#1082
Across multiple channels you spam this stuff. You need to go read, rewards have ended in pool1, will end tmw in pool 2 and end on Sun for pool3.  Yfi Rewards will probably come back but we simply do not know


[07/24/2020 6:56 PM] Benfield#4056
im in the trollbox


[07/24/2020 6:56 PM] mjp.sol#1082
You still get your apr return,you will also got crv tokens, when they release crv


[07/24/2020 6:57 PM] mjp.sol#1082
You can also get bal tokens if you put into either of the bal pools and when bal whitelist us


[07/24/2020 6:57 PM] Benfield#4056
ok well thats all you had to say


[07/24/2020 7:35 PM] Benfield#4056
is there anything else i can do with curve.fi except stake them in the pool1?


[07/24/2020 7:42 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown curve.fi is the website, better to refer to the tokens as yCRV for clarify.  You can stake them in pool 3 (in a 98/2 ratio with YFI), for YFI rewards until Sunday.


[07/24/2020 7:44 PM] Benfield#4056
i do not own YFI i was hoping to get some in pool 1


[07/24/2020 7:44 PM] Benfield#4056
there was no warning that entering pool 1 was a waste of gas


[07/24/2020 7:45 PM] Benfield#4056
why is pool 1 not closed if it provides net negative roi?


[07/24/2020 7:45 PM] Benfield#4056
i feel like i have been cruelly tricked


[07/24/2020 7:54 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown This is a fast moving crazy space, sorry you wasted gas on pool 1, appreciate its difficult to piece together the big picture.  Pool1 will still receive CRV rewards from curve protocol, but no longer YFI.

If you want you can still deposit into pool 3 with the yCRV token you receive for depositing into poo1l, but rewards will  end on Sunday until new vote passes and new rewards begin in a week or so, and the rewards will likely be lower and longer term.  But you need to consider whether the size of your deposit is worth it considering gas fees.  If you are depositing into balancer for the first time I think you will be prompted to set up a proxy contract that will cost you up to $15 in gas.


[07/24/2020 7:56 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Also consider that depositing into pool 3 with just yCRV ( as opposed tot 98/2 yCRV/YFI split) will incur a little slippage / swap fee (again depending on size of deposit)

Is YFI rewards still available for those who provide liquidity in the pools?

Pool 1, no.
Pool 2 until tomorrow sometime
Pool 3 until Sunday sometime


[07/24/2020 8:14 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Then once a vote passes some rewards ought to return in a week or so


[07/24/2020 8:16 PM] Libertarian Salvation#9271
hm....Pool 2 or 3 are Balancer pools ?


[07/24/2020 8:17 PM] Libertarian Salvation#9271
Why so short time period ?


[07/24/2020 8:19 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Rewards were set up to run for 1 week,  and the pools were staggered in their starting time, we are just approaching the end of that week. Why? I couldn't say.


[07/24/2020 8:19 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Yes Pool 1 and 2 are balancer pools


[07/24/2020 8:23 PM] Libertarian Salvation#9271
@Unknown I did not know this deadlines. Where it was disclosed?

Is pool 4 rewards still based on the time + YFI amount stacked ?

So I just removed my liquidity from Pool 2 after a week. How do I claim my BAL?


[07/25/2020 1:19 AM] winter_is_cold#0901
Hello, I have a quesiton.
I staked yesterday on ypool.
curve.fi/iearn/profit   page  says  there  is weekley YFI rewards!
But it  is no true.  right?
———————
Pending YFI LP rewards: 1.52 USD
Paid YFI LP rewards: 0.00 USD
Estimated weekly YFI LP rewards: XXXX USD
Claimable aDAI: 0 aDAI [?] 
Total profit [?] : 1.84 USD 
———————
yieldfarming.info  page says  0 weekley YFI rewards.
———————
======== YFI REWARDS ========  (Temporarily paused until further emission model is voted by the community)
Claimable Rewards : 0.0005 YFI = $1.52
Weekly estimate   : 0 YFI = $0.00 (out of total 0 YFI)
Weekly ROI in USD : 0%
APY (unstable)    : 0% 

======== CRV REWARDS ========
    Not distributed yet
———————


[07/25/2020 2:50 AM] Kendrick Llama#1532

> So I just removed my liquidity from Pool 2 after a week. How do I claim my BAL?
@Unknown No need to claim, BAL will be sent to your address,  happens weekly.


[07/25/2020 4:02 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Clicking "Exit: Claim and unstake" from pool 4, is giving me this error in metamask "ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code."
That's not good....


[07/25/2020 4:06 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Unstaking without claiming rewards tx went through fine


[07/25/2020 4:07 AM] Jin#8315
Just checking, do you fulfill all the requirements? i.e voted recently (not sure how recent tho) & >= 1000 BPT staked


[07/25/2020 4:08 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
I didn't think that recent voting was a requirement for claiming rewards, only for earning them in the first place, maybe I'm wrong, we need better documentation (I have the BPT staked)


[07/25/2020 4:09 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Either way, contact code error should is not a good response.

Is there like a standard for devs to specify what kind of error code/messages to return when a transaction fails? Some sort of error handling perhaps, not sure about that


[07/25/2020 4:13 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Not sure, but this error was shown before tx submitted, in the metamask confirmation popup


[07/25/2020 4:13 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440

[07/25/2020 4:33 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Currently no, waiting for balancer to whitelist the pool tokens. Only if they do that, will BAL rewards apply,

The timer I got yesterday says 1 hour left


[07/25/2020 5:33 AM] huntingisland#6974
but I'm not sure if YFI distribution is clock based or block based. If block based I would expect drift.

it's block based

@Unknown you don't withdraw and claim. You keep yCRV add it to pool 3 to farm YFI while pool 3 is still active for now

@Kendrick Llama Thank you for the response. i am trying to get my tokens out if the ypool on curve.fi into my wallet so i can put them into balancer


[07/25/2020 2:13 PM] Kendrick Llama#1532
when you deposit to y pool, you will receive yCRV to your wallet address already, there is no withdraw step for that


[07/25/2020 2:14 PM] Kendrick Llama#1532
you should see yCRV tokens immediately after you deposit to y pool

if you were in pool 1 before to farm YFI then it means you are staking and you need to unstake

@GiraeffleAeffle BPT is worth about $4.90.  so over $4900 worth of YFI/yCRV


[07/25/2020 2:50 PM] GiraeffleAeffle#1581
Holy moly. That's a lot. Is yCRV and CRV the same?


[07/25/2020 2:51 PM] GiraeffleAeffle#1581
And also I can basically take my yCRV token out of the first pool, since the distribution period is over?


[07/25/2020 3:09 PM] Emilio#6981
yCRV is your deposit on Curves' "Y" pool. CRV is Curve's governance token which has not been launched yet.


[07/25/2020 3:11 PM] Emilio#6981
the yCRV is in your wallet, it is a representation of the liquidity you provided. What you can do is deposit that yCRV on balancer's yCRV/YFI pool to earn pool fees and BAL rewards. By doing that you will receive a BPT token (representing the liquidity you just added to the pool) which can be staked on Pool 3 "Governance" to farm YFI


[07/25/2020 3:12 PM] madye#2563
@emi#8702 where can I see the BAL rewards?


[07/25/2020 3:13 PM] Emilio#6981
BAL rewards are sent every Tuesday to the address from which you added liquidity to the pool


[07/25/2020 3:16 PM] madye#2563
ok, yieldfarming.info says Not whitelisted yet?


[07/25/2020 3:20 PM] Emilio#6981
Right, apparently since yCRV has not yet been whitelisted by Balancer (you can see the contract address instead of the token name), you would not receive BAL rewards

ah understood


[07/25/2020 3:22 PM] madye#2563
so if it gets whitelisted, rewards won't work retroactively for the time you've been staking but from that point onward correct?


[07/25/2020 3:23 PM] Emilio#6981
I guess nobody knows but i find it unlikely that they will distribute rewards retroactively

> I guess nobody knows but i find it unlikely that they will distribute rewards retroactively
@Emilio It's actually technically impossible for them to retroactively distribute, at least on a weekly basis - awards for BAL come from a pool on a weekly basis, once depleted they are gone. Retroactive distribution would require a community consensus, which would "never" happen.

@Unknown If you click the "deposit wrapped" checkbox on the curve ui, you can then deposit your wrapped token directly (yUSDT)


[07/25/2020 4:48 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
This will give you yCRV token back which you deposit into pool 3 to earn YFI

Should I deposit and stake. Or if I stake I won’t be able to use the ycrv on pool 3? Is it mutual exclusive?

If you stake, you dont hold the yCRV anymore. So if you want to deposit yCRV liquidity on Balancer, you must just deposit, not stake


[07/25/2020 5:06 PM] Shai#1550
Once I deposit to Balancer and get the BPT I need to stake it too? Or just use it for voting on the governance dapp?

@Unknown you should get yusdc after depositing


[07/26/2020 6:26 AM] Jin#8315
Also there are some changes to the yusdc contract

BPT trapped in voting. Is there any workaround or just need to wait? Is there any risk for not being able to withdraw since the pool rewards have ended?


[07/26/2020 12:50 PM] blakehendo#9202
@roccosplorer - I have the same issue. How do we know when they release? The UI says a block number that already passed. I don't understand why they are still locked when the vote is already done and closed.


[07/26/2020 1:18 PM] 0x57#0057
isn't it locked 3 days from the time you vote


[07/26/2020 1:29 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@blakehendo I think https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/yfi_ycrv/ may tell you how long you are locked for

Wasnt sure if those 2 checks are for only staking or also claiming


[07/26/2020 3:47 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Pretty sure that having voted and having 1000 btp were only requirements for staking in pool 4.  Not for anything else.


[07/26/2020 5:21 PM] Shai#1550

@Unknown what's pool 4? yVault? I believe it's not doing anything yet


[07/26/2020 7:25 PM] Shai#1550
Don’t know. I think I just read one had to vote earlier to be eligible to participate in it. I’m afraid I missed it


[07/26/2020 7:31 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
In pool 4 you stake yfi to receive yCRV (not big returns), in order to qualify for the returns you need to have 1000 BPT staked (from pool 3) and to have recently voted, which locks your BPT for 3 days after you vote.


[07/26/2020 7:32 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
See "Fee rewards" https://ygov.finance/staking


[07/26/2020 7:51 PM] sina#7327
The YFI incentive for this is gone now though, right? What's next, seems yVaults are up for deposit but aren't actually doing anything yet on the backend


[07/26/2020 7:55 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Yes, YFI incentive gone for now, little yCRV reward  from pool 4.  Whats next? yVaults in progress, and waiting to finalise and implement new reward schedule which will be a more gradual affair than the insanity of last week.


[07/26/2020 7:56 PM] sina#7327
Is there a "single source of truth" for this conversation/development that we can track and point new curious users to?

[07/26/2020 10:08 PM] Sam Cassatt#4315
Hi 🙂 Anyone know why this is happening? I just was trying to claim my rewards from the yCRV fee rewards pool. When I try, it gives me a ridiculously high gas fee and metamask says there's an exception in the code. I still have >1000 BPT staked in the governance pool, but it says I haven't voted recently, since yip-10 is the last thing I voted on.

yeah same for me


[07/26/2020 10:17 PM] Robert#5432
I believe they need to be locked, in order to get rewards


[07/26/2020 10:18 PM] Robert#5432
if I'm not mistaken


[07/26/2020 10:22 PM] Afro#0935
did you vote on a proposal before you staked?


[07/26/2020 10:28 PM] Juan_Snow#3540
> did you vote on a proposal before you staked?
@Afro  probably. I dont remember in what order honestly. I've staked, voted. staked more YFI..voted again on another proposal, which reset the time of my locked bpt tokens


[07/26/2020 10:31 PM] Sam Cassatt#4315
I definitely voted before I staked. I voted on yip-10, which is now done. So maybe you need to have the governance locked in order to claim the yCRV pool rewards?


[07/26/2020 10:32 PM] Sam Cassatt#4315
I just don't want to get either of my funds stuck by doing things in the wrong order😟

also no for me. It unlocked when yip-10 passed


[07/26/2020 10:39 PM] 0xminion#9883
I think the problem is is with the stake reward, when I try to exit,unstake and claim it throws and error


[07/26/2020 10:39 PM] 0xminion#9883
but if you just unstake YFI you will be fine


[07/26/2020 10:39 PM] 0xminion#9883
claiming the yCRV reward still throws an error

Hey all, I'm new to curve and yearn and now a YFI holder... is there a tutorial or faq on what we can do with this coin?  I know its a governance token, I know it can claim from pools, I know you can vote with it and i've watched the good explainer videos, checked the forums, and read the articles.... but I still dont understand exactly how to implement the token?  Thanks for the help 🙂

Time lock isn’t based on proposal, it’s based on the time you voted. Check yield farming info website and you can see countdown clock when you can unstake


[07/27/2020 2:41 AM] jawn#2550
estimated time left should be here:

[07/28/2020 7:58 AM] Laur#4570
do I understand correctly? 
1. to provide liquidity for v2 of yearn, I go to https://yearn.finance/vaults and deposit USDC
2. I don't need to do anything else after that
3. I only get 50% of the profit, because the rest goes to YFI holders?


[07/28/2020 8:30 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Where did you see point 3?


[07/28/2020 8:34 AM] Laur#4570
I don't remember where, but I understand that for the current strategies, 50% goes to vault liquidity providers, and 50% to governance pool

then where more strategies will be added, the creator of each strategy will also be able to propose a percentage for himself


[07/28/2020 11:39 AM] JiroOno#4493

> Yeah I'm still locked as well... And there is nothing to even vote on, doesn't make much sense
@Unknown The lockup period is relevant to when you last voted. I just got unlocked this morning. You can check your own status here: https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/yfi_ycrv/


[07/28/2020 12:22 PM] JiroOno#4493
yeah I know, was just weird cause I voted like 3-5 days ago but I think b/c I voted a second time for the YIP-10 to get the quruom up that it gave me a longer time lock


[07/28/2020 12:23 PM] JiroOno#4493
also just a little salty after that btc move, b/c that was my renbtc stack that I moved over to farm some YFI


[07/28/2020 12:25 PM] Gabriel Nergaard#3459
I just hope the Yearn UI sucks because there simply hasn't been time to get to it, but that the plan is to make it a priority. You'd think there'd at least be a note along the lines of, "If you vote, your pool deposit will be locked for a while."


[07/28/2020 12:25 PM] JiroOno#4493
yeah I think it should be expected to be a pretty rough around the edges right now, primarily b/c Andre is going solo on all of this.


[07/28/2020 12:26 PM] JiroOno#4493
Would be nice to see us get a dev fund together though so we can provide some grants for others to make moves on overhauling the UI, and Andre can continue to focus on the smart contract develop work / research


[07/28/2020 7:44 PM] Shai#1550
Any point in leaving yfi in pool 3? If not, what’s the recommended path now to farm with it?


[07/28/2020 7:45 PM] urukai#5285
I have that same question.


[07/28/2020 7:49 PM] Wilford#0911
Let’s say a proposal passed.. can more proposals be done to change the proposal that passed for example... instead of 50k YFi 100k


[07/28/2020 9:03 PM] dripdrop#3124
Depends on the wording of the proposal. If it said "50k YFI and burn the keys" then...not mutable


[07/28/2020 9:12 PM] mel01#2464
Trying to wrap my head around this. If you withdraw from balancer pool via single asset YFI,  the price of YFI at time of withdrawal does not in any way determine how many YFI you get, right?


[07/28/2020 9:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
It most certainly does determine how much YFI you get. The distribution is based on value portions between the pooled assets.


[07/28/2020 9:24 PM] dripdrop#3124
Higher YFI price = you get less YFI and more [other thing] back when you withdraw from Balancer.


[07/28/2020 9:25 PM] mel01#2464

Hi, I haven't received my BAL for my pool 2 and 3. Received this reply from the Balancer side: @Unknown If you staked BPT into another contract, then that contract is going to receive your BAL. It's up to yearn to reroute it to you.

Anyone?


[07/29/2020 6:35 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown @Unknown In pool 2 and 3, when you stake, you are transferring your BPT token (from balancer that represents your liquidity in the pool), to  staking contracts.  The BAL reward then goes to these addresses.  You ought to get it back later from yean, but an important mechanic to be aware of.


[07/29/2020 7:57 AM] Shai#1550

Team is just Andre and I think he’s too busy for this. This is just the community helping each other, but with the rate this is moving it’s hard to come by anyone who would know more than yourself...;-)

[07/30/2020 4:27 AM] Shebee82#4127
Is there a bug on yearn vault interface? My yUSDC is not showing but it is in my ether wallet


[07/30/2020 4:28 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Tried reloading page / disconnecting and reconnecting wallet?


[07/30/2020 4:32 AM] Shebee82#4127
I have tried all those. My YDAI is showing but not YUSDC


[07/30/2020 4:32 AM] Shebee82#4127
I would like confirmation it is simply a bug


[07/30/2020 4:33 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Sorry, not sure then.


[07/30/2020 5:01 AM] Shebee82#4127
Does Andre ever hop on here or developers?


[07/30/2020 5:06 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Andre, no. Some people are devs but not official product devs I think.


[07/30/2020 5:11 AM] Shebee82#4127
Damn.


[07/30/2020 5:11 AM] Shebee82#4127
Im sure it’s safe as it’s in my wallet


[07/30/2020 5:11 AM] Shebee82#4127
Just a bug

[07/30/2020 5:25 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
That was one of them (Pool 2) but there are no rewards currently, so you might want to wait for the new reward schedule to come through (maybe a week) before depositing / staking.

Graham any idea where we can see vault funds? As in pool address?

Not off the top of my head, might be worth following your tx on etherscan to find it


[07/30/2020 6:09 AM] Shebee82#4127
its in the pool with 260k total


[07/30/2020 6:10 AM] Shebee82#4127
Just can't see it on my Vault interface

Hey there! Just noticed yearn v2 is on. Now I had/have locked my stake on v1, anyone know what I should do ? (V1 still paused, v2 seems to be up and running?)


[07/30/2020 7:28 AM] metamizolmann#7375
Ah as I view it v2 seems to be gov only, so v1 will be back with the yearn pool?


[07/30/2020 11:36 AM] klassicd#6817
Getting the "daily request count exceeded, request rate limited" error when I try to stake on  v2.  Is there another method like calling contract directly?  Or maybe this is a coinbase wallet issue?

@Unknown I'm having the same issue with coinbase wallet, i'm thinking it's an issue with the wallet. I'm going to try it with Metamask to see if that fixes it

@Unknown if you leave just a little bit in the gas fees go down


[07/30/2020 4:13 PM] siipiorava#0056
is there a recommended gas limit for reward withdrawal, I don't want to start experimenting with these prices


[07/30/2020 4:14 PM] amaz_ng#6977
@Unknown I would just go with what metamask suggests. My gas fees went from $125 to $2

Hi! can https://ygov.finance/stake read from smart contract wallets such as Argent's? I have connected via Wallet Connect and it says 0 YFI available to stake.


[07/31/2020 11:07 AM] trotus#7057
Ok! I refreshed an now I see the balance!


[07/31/2020 12:18 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Argent is a great idea, but it scared the shit out of me with  its slow state updates


[07/31/2020 2:46 PM] ghintama#9049
is there any benefit of currently staking yfi in https://ygov.finance/stake ? My understanding is that there are no incentives provided currently


[07/31/2020 2:50 PM] urukai#5285
My question exactly.


[07/31/2020 5:23 PM] siipiorava#0056
you get curve fees and CRV token when it is released


[07/31/2020 5:24 PM] siipiorava#0056
you also can deposit yCRV into the yearn vault if it is within your personal risk tolerance


[07/31/2020 8:42 PM] sweetpotato#2424
what is the different between using yCRV and USDC for Vaults?


[07/31/2020 8:55 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Each vault uses different strategies that are only available to the vault's token.  yCRV last I checked was farming YFII, USDC farming MTA

How to get around paying $243 gas fee when unstaking *any* amount of YFI in Gov?  Solutions anyone?


[08/01/2020 6:32 PM] melm#3791
Also says **Transaction Error - Exception thrown in contract code**

Transaction to unstake, even at $243 gas fee gets reverted and fails. How to unstake YFI from v2 Gov?


[08/01/2020 6:54 PM] einst#0001
did you vote, bc your funds could be locked up until the vote is over


[08/01/2020 6:57 PM] melm#3791

Is unstaking YFI in Gov definitely locked for 3 days affter voting in v2?


[08/01/2020 7:13 PM] Morty#6969
Yes I think. I read it somewhere or heard defidad saying about it in a video.


[08/01/2020 7:14 PM] melm#3791
I hope that's the case


[08/01/2020 8:10 PM] roccosplorer#7711
The yCRV vault does not show how much it has increased in value?


[08/01/2020 8:16 PM] _acap#6983
stop spamming every channel.  How long have you been in the vault?


[08/01/2020 8:17 PM] roccosplorer#7711
Around 6 hours


[08/01/2020 8:17 PM] _acap#6983
lol...give it time.


[08/01/2020 8:17 PM] _acap#6983
If you click the box it should show you how much you put in and in parenthesis how much you have earned.


[08/01/2020 8:20 PM] roccosplorer#7711
Hmm. I thought it would be more. The APY seems very low. I thought its farming YFII and Yffi


[08/01/2020 8:21 PM] roccosplorer#7711
APY per week just 1%


[08/01/2020 10:37 PM] fanofthings#4922
Hey guys have a question. I deposited usdc into yvault, but how do I convert to yusdc into regular usdc? And what token is the reward for putting usdc in the vault?


[08/02/2020 2:01 AM] ONI#6888
you just withdrawal


[08/02/2020 2:02 AM] ONI#6888
you put in usdc and you take out more usdc when you withdrawal thats it.


[08/02/2020 2:02 AM] ONI#6888
@Unknown


[08/02/2020 2:05 AM] fanofthings#4922
@ONI thanks man! And do I get any yfi for adding usdc to the vault?


[08/02/2020 2:06 AM] fanofthings#4922
Once they increase supply that is


[08/02/2020 2:06 AM] ONI#6888
no


[08/02/2020 2:06 AM] ONI#6888
you get more usdc


[08/02/2020 2:06 AM] Morty#6969
aren't we farming  YFII on yCRV and yUSDC Vaults?


[08/02/2020 2:07 AM] ONI#6888
yeild is paid in the same vault coin


[08/02/2020 2:07 AM] ONI#6888
no


[08/02/2020 2:07 AM] ONI#6888
wait yes


[08/02/2020 2:07 AM] Morty#6969
Wouldn't he get YFII tokens also along with the yield?


[08/02/2020 2:07 AM] ONI#6888
yfii is farmed on the ycrv vault and pays out in ycrv (i think)


[08/02/2020 2:07 AM] ONI#6888
no


[08/02/2020 2:07 AM] ONI#6888
its auto converted to what you put in

$YFI is about to go full industrial farming against $YFII. A new yCRV yVault was deployed to farm YFII, immediately dump it for DAI and compound the harvest by using the DAI to farm more YFII 👀

[08/02/2020 2:08 AM] ONI#6888
the whole pools yfii is sold whenever someone calls harvest afaik


[08/02/2020 2:08 AM] Morty#6969
What do you reckon?


[08/02/2020 2:08 AM] Morty#6969
okay


[08/02/2020 2:08 AM] ONI#6888
so it takes profits then puts it into ycrv for everyone and keeps farming


[08/02/2020 2:08 AM] Morty#6969
I see. .


[08/02/2020 2:09 AM] ONI#6888
@alphast0rm isnt that correct or any idea how often ycrv vault's yfii is liquidated into ycrv or adai?


[08/02/2020 2:09 AM] ONI#6888
only when someone calls harvest and that is mostly when someone tries to withdrawal?


[08/02/2020 2:10 AM] Morty#6969
Okay  yes, the  YFII goes into the Balancer Pool for DAI,  DAI back into the yCRV  pool, yCRV to the vault and then rinse and repeat


[08/02/2020 2:10 AM] ONI#6888
yah it clearly shows the flow of funds in the uh picture


[08/02/2020 2:11 AM] ONI#6888
yah the tldr put in ycrv get out more ycrv (and it ever so often liquidates the yfii)


[08/02/2020 2:11 AM] ONI#6888
same with usdc


[08/02/2020 2:11 AM] ONI#6888
put in usdc get out more usdc


[08/02/2020 2:12 AM] ONI#6888
now im not sure is it possible to get less than you put in? anyone?


[08/02/2020 2:12 AM] ONI#6888
@ me if anyone has the answers to my questions, thx


[08/02/2020 2:13 AM] Morty#6969
how long does one have to keep yCRV token in the vault? As the rewards are only visible upon calling harvest()


[08/02/2020 2:15 AM] ONI#6888
no just put in a number in withdrawal and u see ur current amount


[08/02/2020 2:15 AM] ONI#6888
the number in () is what you have now


[08/02/2020 2:16 AM] ONI#6888
the number not is what you put in


[08/02/2020 2:29 AM] Morty#6969
Gotcha. 
So my APY comes up to about 140% if I've calculated this right. 
That sounds about right eh?


[08/02/2020 3:07 AM] gy#9764
How we can’t withdraw yfi from staking even if we didn’t vote?


[08/02/2020 3:07 AM] gy#9764
it won’t let me withdraw and posts a 0.9 eth gas fee. I did not vote with this account


[08/02/2020 3:13 AM] gy#9764
I found a bug in v2 unstaking. It works with normal fees if you manually enter how much yfi you want to withdraw. Don’t click on balance to fill field. That will disallow your withdrawal and set astronomical gas fees.


[08/02/2020 3:14 AM] gy#9764
I figured it out on my own cuz yearn mods are non-existent


[08/02/2020 3:21 AM] gy#9764
doesn’t always work


[08/02/2020 3:21 AM] gy#9764
clearly there’s a problem w v2


[08/02/2020 3:25 AM] gy#9764
Also if you click Claim and Unstake, same problem with disallowing withdrawal


[08/02/2020 3:28 AM] Kiwi#7331

Anyone can tell the difference between ygov.finance and yearn.finance?? I am so confused which platform shall I farm?


[08/02/2020 3:32 AM] gy#9764
on the first non voting account, unstaking didn’t work at first until i manually entered smaller denominations. Then the gas fee was normal @Kiwi


[08/02/2020 3:32 AM] Kiwi#7331
ygov is for staking and governance related things


[08/02/2020 3:32 AM] Kiwi#7331
yearn is for yearn the dapp and its various applications like yvaults


[08/02/2020 3:32 AM] Kiwi#7331
hmm


[08/02/2020 3:34 AM] gy#9764
For a non-voting account, do you still have to register before being able to unstake? @Kiwi or does registering lock you in for 3 days?


[08/02/2020 3:35 AM] Kiwi#7331
registering does not seem to lock


[08/02/2020 3:35 AM] Kiwi#7331
only voting for, against, and revoking


[08/02/2020 3:35 AM] Kiwi#7331
I dont see anything wrong with the contract


[08/02/2020 3:35 AM] Kiwi#7331
maybe its a front end issue


[08/02/2020 3:38 AM] SleepycatS#8924
Staking ycurvefi in pool1 of ygov can not again YFI anymore right? Will YFI farming start again?


[08/02/2020 3:39 AM] Kiwi#7331
cant find anything wrong with the frontend either, hmm


[08/02/2020 3:39 AM] Kiwi#7331

[08/02/2020 3:39 AM] Kiwi#7331

[08/02/2020 3:39 AM] Kiwi#7331
no more new YFI yet @Unknown


[08/02/2020 3:39 AM] Kiwi#7331
we dont know it, its being voted on


[08/02/2020 3:45 AM] Kiwi#7331

[08/02/2020 3:46 AM] Kiwi#7331

reload the site


[08/02/2020 3:50 AM] ONI#6888
I use metamask sometimes it fucks up so I clear cookies then readd ledger to metamask usually fixes problems


[08/02/2020 3:51 AM] Kiwi#7331
If the tx fee is huge then it means the tx as formatted would fail


[08/02/2020 3:53 AM] ONI#6888
that should be fixed in the UI i bet someone will stupidly pay the cost, it will fail and they will be pissed


[08/02/2020 3:54 AM] Kiwi#7331
I think metamask is inaccurate


[08/02/2020 3:54 AM] Kiwi#7331
It shouldn't fully eat the gas


[08/02/2020 3:54 AM] Kiwi#7331
Maybe it's just a deterrent lol, a poor UX one


[08/02/2020 3:58 AM] gy#9764
So if you do vote, unstaking is blocked for 3 days even if the proposal you voted on is over right?


[08/02/2020 4:05 AM] Kiwi#7331
Yes


[08/02/2020 4:05 AM] Kiwi#7331
It's a hard lock for 3 days


[08/02/2020 4:05 AM] Kiwi#7331
It gets refreshed if you do any other votes


[08/02/2020 4:21 AM] reverbb#6056
if you withdraw from the yCRV vault, is there a .5% fee?

anyone know how to trade yCRV for DAI or ETH in the cheapest way? is it using Zap? trying to get back to eth without losing everything in gas fees


[08/02/2020 2:22 PM] Michal#3164
@Unknown  try combination of 1inch.exchange and ethgasstation.info and you can even check in what time is gas prices on lowest point, but i cant remember the site now.

why does it cost so much to unstake YFI? saying its going to be $200


[08/02/2020 4:21 PM] Kiwi#7331
It's a metamask glitch but it means the tx will fail


[08/02/2020 4:21 PM] Kiwi#7331
Seems like a bug or something

I'm getting abnormally high gas costs when I'm trying to add ZRX to yswap.exchange. Like 0.5 ETH, which doesn't seem right. Same with aMKR. However, LEND, REN and ENJ worked just fine. Anybody else running into this?

Anyone use yearn.finance on mobile? I have my hw wallet set up as a watch address on Trust Wallet, but when I click Connect Wallet on yearn.finance and choose Trust Wallet, I get a green dot beside both Trust and Metamask. Nothing else seems to work either.

Any way to connect wallet from mobile solely for the purposes of monitoring balances?

I figured out the flash then white page problem on my Chrome. It is caused by AdBlock. White list yearn sites and it's all good. In case any one hits similar issue, check whether you have AdBlock or alike.

@Farmer John no liquidity on BAL for DAI and yCurve 😫


[08/02/2020 10:27 PM] Farmer John#9835
You need to paste yCurve's contract "0xdf5e0e81dff6faf3a7e52ba697820c5e32d806a8" to select as "Token" to buy. Seems they don't have enough liquidity now for DAI -> yCurve. And there is no USDT -> yCurve there.

poking around to understand this better. looks like on 1inch gas is lower but there is a % fee? for 1000 USDC it's 2.63% and for 100 USDC it's .70%

I don’t use a physical ledger I use Trustwallet app and try connecting to yearn with trust and wallet connect both without success. Also there is a bug with metamask apparently

Hi guys, q on the yCRV vault tokens. I've noticed when I deposit 100 yCRV I get 98 or so yyCRV tokens (vault tokens). Does this mean some fee/penalty is being charged, or would the 98 yyCRV get exchanged for 100 yCRV when I exit?


[08/03/2020 6:18 PM] justwanttoknowathing#3762
In the beginning yCRV and yyCRV were 1:1, as time passes yyCRV is appreciating, thus the price difference.

[08/03/2020 11:49 PM] Kiwi#7331

[08/03/2020 11:50 PM] southseacompany#8897
Claim and Unstake always fails due to a bug in the governance staking contract. It's not specific to you.

@Unknown Well when you unstake the transaction is to send your staking tokens (that you received for staking) to the contract to receive back the YFI, so that might be the "auto-populates backwards" thing you mention.  Can you see what token it wants to send?


[08/04/2020 5:00 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Where do you see it doing that?

When I try unstake, it does show my yCRV balance, but the transaction keeps failing

How long until one can unstake YFI without high fees, assuming it’s based on a schedule? I don’t have much, just testing everything out


[08/04/2020 9:21 PM] milkyklim#3300
It should last time you've voted + 3 days

To claim rewards, do you have to have voted AFTER you staked yfi?


[08/06/2020 4:45 AM] mxmt#2770
Anyone knowledgeable about YSWap here? I’ve irresponsible deposited a lot of REN in there and can’t see any information about it. Scared to lose it all or to lose on price action. (Withdrawing seems to be impossible atm)

How do I stake yCRV? Or is that already staked? Too much of a noob..


[08/06/2020 11:58 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown yCRV is the token you get from curve for providing liquidity. If you want you could deposit it to the yCRV vault here. https://yearn.finance/vaults


[08/06/2020 11:59 AM] NeuralVirus#5025
Yeah I deposited CRV in that vault and got yCRV


[08/06/2020 11:59 AM] NeuralVirus#5025
I think I'm misunderstanding though


[08/06/2020 12:00 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
CRV doesnt exist yet, it is the curve reward token coming soon.  You probably deposit some stable-coins to curve to the the yCRV


[08/06/2020 12:01 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
But if you are looking to earn with your yCRV then you can use that yCRV vault I linked to.


[08/06/2020 12:02 PM] NeuralVirus#5025
Yeah I think maybe I deposited the "yDAI/yUSDC/..." since it shows I have a balance of yCRV deposited, thank you. This stuff is so confusing lol

Hey guys quick question. I've been staking my YFI from pretty much the beginning, but unstaked them today to put them on a hardware wallet, then staked them back (just to be safer as they were on Metamask before that). When CRV are released, will I still be able to claim the CRV I collected during these first few weeks with my Metamask, even though I'm now staking my CRV with another wallet?


[08/07/2020 4:50 PM] egs5000#5000
I've had YFI in governance staking and voted on 34 ,but claim rewards is still greyed out. I don't even want to claim them yet but in general I'm wondering, when do these become available to claim? It just says you have to have voted but I have voted, does the vote period for the topic need to finish?


[08/07/2020 4:53 PM] egs5000#5000
also I voted for the same option twice because at first I thought I hadn't voted yesterday, only realizing my mistake after. did this mess anything up for my vote?


[08/07/2020 5:04 PM] klassicd#6817
@mxmt Yes I believe so.  Rewards are sent to the original wallet address used.


[08/08/2020 7:43 AM] cauchy#9400
Ive staked on the Ypool at curve.fi and then staked the resulting tokens in yearn.finance ycrv.fi pool. Is there anything else I should consider to maximise the yield?


[08/08/2020 8:07 AM] ONI#6888
Yes they are sent to each address used during that time. So u should get crv at both addresses in various amounts. @mxmt


[08/08/2020 9:55 PM] Obnauticus#2300
@Unknown I'm having exactly the same problem. It let me stake an additional fraction of a YFI, but won't let me unstake it back out or collect rewards. I voted on 34 recently as well.


[08/08/2020 9:55 PM] Obnauticus#2300
I'm guessing it's that the staked YFI are still locked for 3 days it just doesn't show us anywhere.


[08/08/2020 9:56 PM] Obnauticus#2300
Doesn't explain why we can't claim rewards tho. (also, the rewards don't seem to be accruing anymore)


[08/08/2020 10:23 PM] tradertravis#3695
Yeah I noticed no accruing too 🤔


[08/08/2020 10:29 PM] Obnauticus#2300
They probably just need to fix it so V2 gov knows when people have voted or something. Also, if there's still a 3 day lock for staked coins after voting it would be nice to see that somewhere.


[08/09/2020 4:24 AM] tradertravis#3695
Q: Do you have to vote in the governance to accrue rewards? (not withdraw them, I know you have to vote to be able to withdraw rewards)


[08/09/2020 4:25 AM] tradertravis#3695
Reason I ask is because "rewards available" in ygov website has not increased in the last day or so


[08/09/2020 4:43 AM] trotus#7057
Hi all, I need help :(
So at the start, I was providing liquidity on yCurve and got some YFI. I was doing all that from a smart contract wallet (Argent) vía WalletConnect in https://www.curve.fi/iearn. I was on holiday at the time and it was the only way. 

There are issues with WalletConnect in https://ygov.finance and https://yearn.finance/ and and I have **not been able** to vote, test vaults or stake. Later I found that I could stake via Zapper.fi. I **did that** but I cannot vote still.

Initially I was waiting until the WalletConnect issue was resolved but it's been frustrating so I decided to move the position to the hardware wallet. But it turns out I cannot do that…. as I cannot just  ‘unstake’ but ‘unstake AND claim rewards’ via Zapper.fi. And I cannot unstake AND claim rewards….. because I cannot vote (I guess).

I don’t know what I am doing wrong… Does someone have a tip for getting out of this mess?

The (V2 https://ygov.finance/vote)  normally shows me ‘No Proposals’ for days… which i know it’s not the case. Sometimes I can see the proposals but when I click on register or register to vote nothing happens. Just a blue loading line below the browser address bar but that’s it.

[08/10/2020 12:31 AM] dripdrop#3124
I have the same question. Also, I noticed that YFI staking rewards have stopped sometime today. (My understanding was that you keep earning rewards forever if you've voted at least once and staked, NOT that you need to vote every 3 days to earn rewards. Correct? Not talking about claiming, just earning.)


[08/10/2020 2:09 AM] dripdrop#3124
I’ve seen a couple other people on Telegram also say they’ve stopped receiving rewards accrual. UI bug or...?

[08/10/2020 5:19 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Think they are both the same, if you use link it just converts to aLink.  One wraps the other I think.


[08/10/2020 9:00 AM] mxmt#2770
@Unknown not 100% sure it’s the same though. I feel like the farming process/strategy may be slightly different

@Unknown No need for that. It's a bug in the UI. I guess you can try to claim via etherscan. Personally, I'm leaving the rewards there, expecting that in the future when governance v3 rolls out, the lock-up in the old contract will be disabled and rewards can be withdrawn without hassle.

Everything is expensive now, but if you're seeing mega high tx cost in Metamask, it's MM's way of telling you that the transaction is going to fail.

thx, and I just connect my wallet and then write to the withdraw function for the amount I want to remove?


[08/14/2020 1:57 AM] PlinytheEther#6424
I assume


[08/14/2020 2:14 AM] matkam#1152
I assume so, let us know how it goes


[08/14/2020 10:37 AM] sebastiantf#8644
Noob here. Why does the Deposit and Stake button on curve.fi disappear after I connect my wallet?


[08/14/2020 12:48 PM] Zografa#3227
hi guys i have some weird problem, when i deposited into the y.curve.fi pool i see my ycrv but the balance is not changing i dont earn anything


[08/14/2020 12:58 PM] Astatine#7609
Same problem here, Balance is not changing since the upgrade in the UI


[08/14/2020 8:17 PM] DeFi Ted (Bakes)#0367
@Unknown @Astatine if you are in the vault you can use zapper.io to see the change in your USD balance


[08/14/2020 9:51 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
I think you mean https://zapper.fi/ 🙂


[08/15/2020 5:09 AM] Extr0pia#9390
hi


[08/15/2020 5:09 AM] Extr0pia#9390
how can i see my profit in yvault ?


[08/15/2020 5:10 AM] Extr0pia#9390
i mean i must bee earning more ycurve than i put into it


[08/15/2020 5:10 AM] Extr0pia#9390
any dashboards for this ?


[08/15/2020 5:10 AM] Extr0pia#9390
zapper no welp


[08/15/2020 5:52 AM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Extr0pia Nothing I know of currently. I have a record of what I invested, then I look at the my current vault balance and calculate the difference.  Sure this will improve over time.


[08/15/2020 6:04 AM] Extr0pia#9390
i got a way


[08/15/2020 8:06 AM] tradertravis#3695
Hi, is there a way to depost into the ycrv vault without using the website? I seem to be getting a gas fee of like over $500


[08/15/2020 8:06 AM] tradertravis#3695
Ive previously deposited before, so not sure why its not working now


[08/15/2020 8:17 AM] milkyklim#3300
Does metamask through an error? Are those actual fees you see?


[08/15/2020 8:18 AM] tradertravis#3695
yes


[08/15/2020 8:18 AM] tradertravis#3695
its weird, its asking me to approve again


[08/15/2020 8:18 AM] tradertravis#3695
but like I said, ive already approved the first time to spend my ycrv

[08/15/2020 8:41 AM] ONI#6888
> 1.15 for a stablecoin
@Unknown you're mistaken. ycrv isn't a stable coin. Its an index of yield accruing stable coins that also accrues fees. ie the price of ycrv is always increasing.


[08/15/2020 8:48 AM] ONI#6888
now im not saying that wasnt a good deal lol could have been

sorry it was from above I just wanted to clarify


[08/15/2020 8:50 AM] milkyklim#3300
If there is no error in the same metamask window below we are stuck in the vault till gas prices go down. Which price and gas limit you have? @Unknown


[08/15/2020 8:51 AM] tradertravis#3695
Eth gas station is like 100 right now @milkyklim


[08/15/2020 8:54 AM] ONI#6888
> Q: if I unstake my ycrv from the y vault does that then revert it back to the Curve Fi pool at Curve or do I have to do something else like restake it there?
@Unknown @milkyklim the ycrv recieved is now going to be staked under the dao curve minter or just on the ypool ?


[08/15/2020 8:55 AM] ONI#6888
whenever one withdrawals from the ycrv vault is it ycrv staked here https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit or here https://dao.curve.fi/minter/gauges

[08/15/2020 9:22 AM] tradertravis#3695
@milkyklim oh wait, so for some weird reason the gas limit is huge. Shouldn't it be like 21000?

yes it is failing....why?


[08/15/2020 9:40 AM] tradertravis#3695
this is my 2nd deposit into the ycrv vault....why is meta mask asking me to approve the yearn vault the ok to take my ycrv when ive already approved it the first time i deposited?


[08/15/2020 9:44 AM] tradertravis#3695
im depositing less this time than the first so it can't be a limit problem


[08/15/2020 9:47 AM] tradertravis#3695
setting the gas limit to 21000 gets me this error

metamask yeah

disconnect it and reconnect

using ledger or just metamask?


[08/15/2020 10:16 AM] tradertravis#3695
just metamask


[08/15/2020 10:16 AM] ONI#6888
you're trying to deposit into a vault?


[08/15/2020 10:17 AM] tradertravis#3695
yes


[08/15/2020 10:18 AM] ONI#6888
click ur balance on the deposit page then 100% ( if that is what u want) then hit deposit


[08/15/2020 10:18 AM] ONI#6888
after u reconnect ur metamask


[08/15/2020 10:18 AM] ONI#6888
if the fee is outragous then its not working still


[08/15/2020 10:18 AM] ONI#6888
I would say log out of metamask and log back in if that is the case


[08/15/2020 10:18 AM] tradertravis#3695
ive done that, fee is still crazy high


[08/15/2020 10:19 AM] tradertravis#3695
Ive rebooted my computer twice


[08/15/2020 10:19 AM] tradertravis#3695

the limit is higher than what im trying to deposit now

@milkyklim


[08/15/2020 10:26 AM] ONI#6888
im not sure how to fix that error, other than what I said. I would just wait for now. Make sure you are depositing less than the amount of coins you actually have in your wallet. check etherscan maybe. only reason I can think this error would happen.


[08/15/2020 10:32 AM] tradertravis#3695
hmmm


[08/15/2020 10:32 AM] tradertravis#3695
im putting in really low numbers just to check ...like 50....and it looks like it will work


[08/15/2020 10:32 AM] tradertravis#3695
transaction looks normal


[08/15/2020 10:33 AM] tradertravis#3695
do you know how I can check what the contract thinks my approval limit is?


[08/15/2020 10:36 AM] ONI#6888
odd. Not sure, I dont have to approve like this, just once I think


[08/15/2020 10:38 AM] tradertravis#3695
welp...through trial and error, my max deposit looks like 970


[08/15/2020 10:38 AM] acv_#7801
ok i know im going to sound real dumb here. can someone clarify that what im saying is correct? Currently, I have deposited to the y pool on curve.fi. When I go to the vaults on yearn.finance, i can see the amount of ycrv i have on curve.fi.. The vault shows less than curve.fi does. Why?  And If i click deposit on the vault, this pulls the ycrv out of curve and puts it in the vault, which earns its own interest correct? How many transactions will it take to move the ycrv to the vault? The first transaction isnt very expensive on metamask.


[08/15/2020 10:38 AM] ONI#6888
no ycrv is your y pool token


[08/15/2020 10:39 AM] tradertravis#3695
@Unknown 1 ycrv is actually a bit more than $1....like $1.04 which is why it looks like you have less


[08/15/2020 10:39 AM] ONI#6888
doesnt pull it out of the pool


[08/15/2020 10:39 AM] ONI#6888
it only takes one maybe 2 trxs max to depoist


[08/15/2020 10:39 AM] ONI#6888
deposit


[08/15/2020 10:39 AM] acv_#7801
ok i see so the ycrv will remain on curve.fi and in the vault at the same time?


[08/15/2020 10:39 AM] acv_#7801
my brain hurts


[08/15/2020 10:40 AM] acv_#7801
ty @Unknown


[08/15/2020 10:43 AM] ONI#6888
You can think of ycrv as an index of yield bearing stablecoins (ydai+yusdc+yusdt+ytusd) that also generates yield (trading fees from the curve y pool) as well. Therefore the price of ycrv is always increasing.


[08/15/2020 10:43 AM] ONI#6888
ycrv is the pool token of curve y pool ok


[08/15/2020 10:43 AM] acv_#7801
ok


[08/15/2020 10:43 AM] ONI#6888
the token gets fees on stable coin swaps on ypool


[08/15/2020 10:43 AM] ONI#6888
and when u deposit ydai+yusdc+yusdt+ytusd you get ycrv


[08/15/2020 10:44 AM] ONI#6888
now the vault takes your pool token which is still accuring fees (and yield from the individual coins ydai ect) and loans it out to make more money basically or farm crv in the case of the current strategy


[08/15/2020 10:44 AM] ONI#6888
so


[08/15/2020 10:45 AM] ONI#6888
who it works is put in dai get ydai


[08/15/2020 10:45 AM] ONI#6888
ydai is a lending aggragator


[08/15/2020 10:45 AM] acv_#7801
ok this is making more sense


[08/15/2020 10:45 AM] ONI#6888
take ydai (getting yield) put it into a pool


[08/15/2020 10:45 AM] ONI#6888
the ycrv pool which consists of ydai+yusdc+yusdt+ytusd


[08/15/2020 10:46 AM] ONI#6888
you can paid to hold ycrv as it gets fees from swaps between these coins ydai yusdc ...


[08/15/2020 10:46 AM] ONI#6888
ok


[08/15/2020 10:46 AM] ONI#6888
ycrv repesents the index of coins in the pool


[08/15/2020 10:46 AM] acv_#7801
i think it just clicked! so when i deposited into curve, i bought ytokens which are actually ycrv. when i move the tokens to the vaults, im not getting interest based on the vault strategy and not the curve pool.


[08/15/2020 10:46 AM] ONI#6888
now take ycrv and use it to make crv on curve minter and sell crv at market value adding it to the vault pool thus increasing your money


[08/15/2020 10:47 AM] ONI#6888
that is what the vault does


[08/15/2020 10:47 AM] ONI#6888
you were given a share of the ever increase pool


[08/15/2020 10:47 AM] ONI#6888
this share is called ycrv


[08/15/2020 10:47 AM] ONI#6888
no when you move ycrv to the vault your farming crv tokens and selling them making money


[08/15/2020 10:48 AM] tradertravis#3695
@milkyklim ok so an update....im trying to deposit 1665 ycrv....i was getting errors for any size deposit over 970....so I did 1 deposit transaction for 970 which went through. Now I have 695 ycrv left in my metamask wallet and i can't deposit any of it. Not even 1. Its like 970 was my max limit or something


[08/15/2020 10:48 AM] ONI#6888
odd maybe a dev will be online soon to help


[08/15/2020 10:49 AM] acv_#7801
but thats behind the scenes right? to me im just getting interest? the vault is automatically farming and selling crv and paying me in ycrv?


[08/15/2020 10:49 AM] tradertravis#3695
im going to bed now....hopefully ill get a response when i wake up. Night all.


[08/15/2020 10:51 AM] acv_#7801

[08/15/2020 10:52 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[08/15/2020 10:52 AM] ONI#6888
that is right


[08/15/2020 10:52 AM] ONI#6888
all you do is deposit sit back and when u withdrawal you get more ycrv

so right now metemask shows the fee is going to be $3. im seeing these huge gas fees everywhere, why is this so low?


[08/15/2020 10:53 AM] ONI#6888
for deposit


[08/15/2020 10:53 AM] ONI#6888
its probably for approval to spend ycrv


[08/15/2020 10:53 AM] ONI#6888
not for the deposit read what it says


[08/15/2020 10:54 AM] acv_#7801

[08/15/2020 10:54 AM] acv_#7801
yes you are correct


[08/15/2020 10:55 AM] acv_#7801
guess ill spend the $3 to find out the real gas lol


[08/15/2020 10:55 AM] ONI#6888
haha yah


[08/15/2020 10:56 AM] ONI#6888
not that the gas shown in metamask is the max costs will probably be lower


[08/15/2020 10:58 AM] acv_#7801
$7


[08/15/2020 11:03 AM] ONI#6888
nice not bad


[08/15/2020 11:05 AM] acv_#7801
might as well give it a show the ypool was getting borning


[08/15/2020 11:05 AM] acv_#7801
boring


[08/15/2020 11:06 AM] acv_#7801
one more ?. currently this vault does not earn crv because its being sold for the interest correct?


[08/15/2020 11:07 AM] ONI#6888
?


[08/15/2020 11:07 AM] ONI#6888
oh well there is little reason to just be in ypool


[08/15/2020 11:07 AM] ONI#6888
might as well stake and earn crv


[08/15/2020 11:07 AM] ONI#6888
and the vault is a good place for that if your ok with the risk


[08/15/2020 11:09 AM] acv_#7801
yea i went in on ypool the day after yfi rewards stopped lol. i didnt read.


[08/15/2020 11:32 AM] milkyklim#3300
@Unknown you sure you approved enough tokens? Seems to me that you approved 970 tokens and this is why you can't put more


[08/15/2020 12:06 PM] Nub#3298
So i went to address 0xBa37B002AbaFDd8E89a1995dA52740bbC013D992 which appears to be the staking contract. It only has 16 million worth of YFI in it. I went and looked at what i think is the YFI Yam staking contract 0xc5B6488c7D5BeD173B76Bd5DCA712f45fB9EaEaB and it looks like there is almost 60 million worth of YFI farming Yams. Can someone explain how this is possible with voting going on? I thought you had to be staked to vote. How can any proposals reach quorum?


[08/15/2020 12:11 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Perhaps because there are no open proposals at the moment


[08/15/2020 12:11 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
And a potential nice farming opportunity there


[08/15/2020 1:52 PM] grimey#0736

[08/15/2020 2:52 PM] Extr0pia#9390
wanna know what to expect


[08/15/2020 3:16 PM] Nub#3298
Do you have to be staked in the governance contract to earn rewards on your YFI? I know you have to stake and vote to claim rewards, I'm just curious if those rewards accrue even while you are out of the governance pool.


[08/15/2020 3:38 PM] m3th0d#0867
does YFI have a roadmap?  If so, can you share a link?


[08/15/2020 4:19 PM] trotus#7057

> @Unknown you sure you approved enough tokens? Seems to me that you approved 970 tokens and this is why you can't put more
@milkyklim 

A week ago I approved 3000 and deposited 2000. No issues.

Does my approval limit expire?

And besides, I was able to deposit 970, the very next transaction I should be able to deposit at least 970 again right? I can't even deposit 1 token


[08/15/2020 11:12 PM] dunks411#2178

@Unknown would also love to find that out.

> @Unknown would also love to find that out.
@lefterisjp | Rotki it's on the vault page, above the withdraw button there are two yCRV balances, the left one is the "vault yCRV", the right one is the yCRV amount you'd get when you withdraw


[08/16/2020 9:08 AM] lefterisjp | Rotki#7253
Thanks @Unknown . Yeah that I can see. But is it after the withdrawal fee of 0.5%? Also after the performance fee of 5%?  Also how often does it update?

I am trying to recalculate all these independently with some scripts looking at the code and I so far can get the same number, but not sure if fees are included or not.

Hi, could someone please guide me how to get on yDAIv3 starting from aDAI?


[08/16/2020 1:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
it seems like a waste to swap aDAI for DAI again

nevermind, I went through the contract and you can't.

A question: i used my YFI for the first time to stake, and then tried to vote. The transaction was successful, but there is nothing in UI to indicate it. Infact, it let me vote again, apparently.


[08/17/2020 6:44 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
when you vote the governance contract adds your votes to the proposal.  You can vote again, but it will count for 0 unless you staked more YFI before voting again.

Hi there, I voted today (twice, thought first one didnt go through) but I'm still not able to claim rewards? And secondly: Why did I get rewards initially (startet staking yesterday) alltough it should have went to the treasury instead? It stopped now giving me rewards though.

Hi, new to the group here. Apologies if this has already been asked. Today I staked my YFI at ygov.finance and I also voted. Is it normal that the dashboard still says 'You need to have voted to claim rewards'?

I guess nexus Mutual insurance isn't available for the vaults? Only ydai on the list, and it's at max capacity.

@Richard Feynmann if you use the direct ZAP with Zapper it was about $60-70 last i checked yesterday.. It will put you right into the YCRV vault w/ ETH if you like, but slippage, etc


[08/18/2020 8:07 AM] Deleted User#0000

Hi everyone!


[08/18/2020 10:03 AM] Renaudgagne#4519
So after two days reading what I could about vault, I still don't understand something...
So right now I have X amount of yCRV in the Curve.fi Y LP that I deposited. So far my nominal amount of ycrv hasn't change...is that what I should expect to grow? How often does that happen? (daily, weekly?)


[08/18/2020 10:29 AM] MrYukonC#1171
@Harry Getting the same error / high TX fee here as well.
I assume (but who knows?) it has to do with the fact that you voted?
Once you vote, is the YFI locked for the duration of the vote?  That is unclear to me, but from scrolling back through previous comments it sounds like that might be the case.
Anyone else know?


[08/18/2020 10:33 AM] Harry#2998
It would make sense, but is completely counter-intuitive. If correct, it should be made much clearer (i.e. greyed out unstake button with a text for 3 days) as people might be willing to pay the 1+ETh gas fees, while the transaction still would fail.


[08/18/2020 10:38 AM] MrYukonC#1171
Agreed. I just don't know if that's the case or not.
This place is a mess, would be nice if there was a sticky or something addressing some of these issues that people are clearly running into *daily*.
Also, is staking fee/reward generation halted?  It looks like it.  But again, who knows?

[08/18/2020 11:05 AM] apenator.eth#3341
@Unknown fee/reward generation is paused until the treasury is filled to $500k (see yip-36 which was passed), after that it will continue to accrue to staked YFI. Currently treasury is at something like ~ $300k

I staked my yfi on https://ygov.finance/stake 3 days ago and the rewards stopped increasing over a day ago. So i have not earned more rewards despite still having my tokens still staked.

dear support community, i need some clarification.. i staked an "x" amount of yCurve in the yVault.. it gives me in brackets a "y" amount in yCurve (which i understand is just badly named, and is actually supposed to be yyCurve, short for yyDAI+yUSDC....), this amount has steadily been growing for the past 36 hrs since i staked.. however, if i wanted to withdraw now, i would get a maximum of my "x" amount in yCurve, which is the amount i staked.. so, where are the earnings in that? do i have to wait a certain amount of time (like a week, or 3 days, or whatever) for the earnings to reflect in my staked amount or what's the trick?


[08/19/2020 9:16 AM] drumbuie#3715
to be more precise, here's a screenshot of what i mean.. max I can withdraw is the amount I staked.. please explain what happens with the amount earned if i do that

[08/19/2020 10:15 AM] mxmt#2770
One thing that isn't explained clearly about proposal 37 is what will happen to this 2.5x CRV tokens once claimed by YFI. I'm assuming the most likely option is they will be redistributed to YFI holders, but given what yFI has been doing with other tokens, the protocol could also just sell them immediately and redistribute the earnings in yCRV. Or maybe that will be defined by a later vote once this proposal has passed (which it obviously will from what I'm seeing)?

Pays better but it has more risk as it’s actively moving and using your funds. You have to determine your risk tolerance


[08/19/2020 11:51 AM] Happy#3850
@Unknown I think there was no more rewards and you can unstake after 72 hours without the high gas fees

Hi folks! The Gas Limit is set extremely high to approve yCRV spend limit (~12M Gas) when I try to provide liquidity to yUSD vault. Any idea why this is so, and what the correct Gas Limit is, what may I safely reduce it to without my affecting tx? Normally approving spend costs like $3-4, it's showing $520 right now! Is this right?

I think I can use metamask's integration to Ledger to switch it, but yeah -- if you select Ledger from the "Wallet" selection you can only use your first account it seems. Curve actually gives you a second pop-up that lets you pick your actual account

Any idea why it costs my $500+ to unstake YFI from gov? That can't be correct, right?

@Unknown They're locked for 3 days from the last time you voted. You cannot unstake in that time.

@popcornkirby i dont. When I withdraw, I just get my yUSD back


[08/20/2020 2:52 AM] popcornkirby#7582
You get a token when you deposit, not withdraw


[08/20/2020 2:53 AM] popcornkirby#7582
When you withdraw, you are exchanging your yyCRV token to get back yCRV


[08/20/2020 2:53 AM] JacKall#8612
Well

Any idea why this is so, and what the correct Gas Limit is, what may I safely reduce it to without my affecting tx? Normally approving spend costs like $3-4, it's showing $520 right now! Is this right?

Anyone know minimum Gas Limit for approving yCRV token spend? Right now Metamask is populating 11886183 for me. I imagine setting it at 1 million will also work?


[08/20/2020 3:12 AM] popcornkirby#7582
Not at the desk to try but I think even 150k would do

[08/20/2020 3:14 AM] cumpoonin#4502
Naah, it failed with 150k


[08/20/2020 3:15 AM] cumpoonin#4502
It's probably been intentionally set that high. Is there a limit to what the vault wants to accept?


[08/20/2020 3:15 AM] popcornkirby#7582
Nope


[08/20/2020 3:16 AM] popcornkirby#7582
Usually if the gas estimate is that high, it will fail even if you go for the transaction at the estimated gas


[08/20/2020 3:21 AM] cumpoonin#4502
Ok interesting. Curious why this is happening. None of the other vaults have this issue.


[08/20/2020 3:22 AM] cumpoonin#4502
I mean, it's estimating 66k Gas for the DAI vault.

@Unknown Thanks! I think I found the issue.  My address was pre-approved to spend some yCRV already (from the previous time I had provided liquidity). I first needed to cancel the old approval (because I wanted to approve a larger amount this time)--used approved.zone to do it--and then re-approve for the larger amount. I think the vault does not yet throw to metamask the cancellation of old approval (it does this on Curve, for instance).

[08/20/2020 11:29 AM] apenator.eth#3341
that means you are most likely still vote locked (has it been 3 days since you voted?) and TX will not actually go through

I have staked YFI on ygov.finance and voted For on 2 different proposals. Currently I have no rewards as the treasury is not at 500k yet, however is it normal that the page says 'You need to have voted in order to claim rewards'?


[08/20/2020 4:26 PM] MrYukonC#1171
> is it normal that the page says 'You need to have voted in order to claim rewards'?
Yes.


[08/20/2020 4:37 PM] RiffRaff#3052
Thanks. Once there are rewards accrued, that message will dissapear and I can just click the Claim button?


[08/20/2020 4:38 PM] MrYukonC#1171
Not sure since I haven't done it yet. But most likely.
Also, you can check your 3-day vote lock/unlock status here: https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/ygov2/


[08/20/2020 4:40 PM] RiffRaff#3052
Ok. Apart from ability to vote, when the treasury is below $500k, is there no point in staking YFI in ygov? As I won't be earning anything until it hits 500k? I could potentially stake my YFI elsewhere until it hits 500k?


[08/20/2020 4:41 PM] MrYukonC#1171
Yeah, that sounds right to me.
Treasury should hopefully hit $500k by sometime next week.
Was at $300k a few days ago and I thought someone above said it's now above $400k.


[08/20/2020 4:42 PM] RiffRaff#3052
Ok, thanks for all the answers! Yes its 414k now


[08/20/2020 4:43 PM] MrYukonC#1171
No problem.
Only other thing that's still not clear for me is whether you have to vote on every YIP, or just one, in order to accrue rewards?


[08/20/2020 4:43 PM] RiffRaff#3052
I'm not sure but would assume just one. I accidentally just voted on a second one not long ago.. forgetting it would lock my YFI for 3 days again lol

Yet I have not interacted with it since voting the other day


[08/21/2020 2:39 PM] MrYukonC#1171
Well, that's the thing, Coinbase could have moved things around on the back end. For example, I *think* they give you a new address every time you make a deposit, etc.


[08/21/2020 2:39 PM] Finatic#2078
not the "wallet"


[08/21/2020 2:39 PM] Finatic#2078
it doesnt use their front end at all


[08/21/2020 2:39 PM] Finatic#2078

[08/21/2020 2:40 PM] MrYukonC#1171
You might want to contact Coinbase support for this one. I bet they can help.


[08/21/2020 2:40 PM] Finatic#2078
I just cant figure out how the balance would change when the contract is still open

[08/21/2020 2:48 PM] Finatic#2078
I can provide my eth address on that contract.  You can see me adding it on there and voting


[08/21/2020 2:58 PM] Finatic#2078
If anyone here is technical enough to either look into this, or provide some logic on what the hell happened that would be greatly appreciated.  Like I said, I can provide the full ETH address on that contract if that helps.  Here I am hoping this will magically reverse itself but starting to loose hope on that...  it just doesn't make sense to me how this could even happen when it was locked/staked in a damn contract...


[08/21/2020 2:59 PM] MrYukonC#1171
I would contact Coinbase support.


[08/21/2020 2:59 PM] Finatic#2078

[08/21/2020 3:00 PM] Robin | p.Network#9580
I put in an experimental small amount (under 500) into yearn and then ycurve in feb with an equal balance DAI+USDC+USDT+TUSD. At the time you had to do one then move it to the other. The daily profit was always very small, but I just wanted to get my bearings, and I missed the whole yield farming thing. 

Anyhow.. now it says I have $0 daily profit, and 0% of the pool. Is the pool just so big now? Or did I miss some action item when new products were introduced?


[08/21/2020 3:04 PM] Finatic#2078
The WEIRDEST thing is its not showing any done or open proposals either??? Shouldn't the ones recently voted on show up there?

[08/21/2020 3:16 PM] Finatic#2078
should I disconnect and connect the wallet again?  Risks involved?


[08/21/2020 3:18 PM] MrYukonC#1171
No risks.
It's pretty much all that's left to try anyway.


[08/21/2020 3:19 PM] Finatic#2078
it is obviously not syncing right or something if you see proposals...


[08/21/2020 3:21 PM] MrYukonC#1171
There is one current open proposal.


[08/21/2020 3:21 PM] Finatic#2078
but if you click "done" tab you see previous proposals right?


[08/21/2020 3:21 PM] Finatic#2078
I see nothing there as well, and I voted for two of them lol


[08/21/2020 3:23 PM] MrYukonC#1171
Yes. I see the done list.


[08/21/2020 3:24 PM] Finatic#2078
so fucking weird.. what the fuck


[08/21/2020 3:31 PM] Finatic#2078
Tried three different systems, I work in IT so I have plenty to try with.  All do the same thing when they connect to the wallet, no voting proposals show up nor my balance under staking.  I am at a loss...


[08/21/2020 3:33 PM] MrYukonC#1171
Sorry. 🤷

If I stake Dai into yearn, can I be certain that I can get my balance back in Dai?  Or does it depend on inventory, like with mStable?

Coinbase Wallet (not coinbase.com).  I connected my Metamask and now I can see the votes.  Connected back to original wallet.  Still no balance.  This is when I staked it, you can verify I never moved the funds since then:  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3f74f8eb4d0f03b8dd468bf82ae...

[08/22/2020 12:56 AM] Finatic#2078
FWIW, importing my wallet to Metamask as suggested by someone appears to have resolved the sync issues.


[08/22/2020 4:59 AM] 0xMaki ⌐◨-◨#6969
I was wondering I currently have a small amount of YFI and I am abroad without my cold wallet. Staking in the gouv pool do I need to keep on voting to earn my yUSD at the moment or do I get more rewards for doing so ?


[08/22/2020 4:59 AM] 0xMaki ⌐◨-◨#6969
( no action = still receive a portion of yUSD, voting = more rewards. is my question basically)


[08/22/2020 5:10 AM] 0xMaki ⌐◨-◨#6969
I voted in v1, do I still need to register for v2?


[08/22/2020 8:05 AM] MrYukonC#1171
@Unknown It's up to you, but I would stop using that Coinbase wallet and get a real hardware wallet like a Ledger or something and use *that* via Metamask for this type of stuff.


[08/22/2020 12:01 PM] Shai#1550
I deposited aLink and got yaLink. How do I check the rewards? The UI only shows the amount staked...


[08/22/2020 12:08 PM] apenator.eth#3341
@Unknown https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/yvault/ also on UI with time your (xxx aLink) amount will increase, representing the rewards

How to check your $YFi ygov balance directly.

· Go to the contract address in etherscan https://t.co/VVX4xAz8b2

· Under "2. balanceOf", paste in your address

· Using the value in Response, calculate: ( VALUE * 10 ^ -18 )

@Unknown Problem is, gov UI cannot show my YFI balance in my ETH address. 0 balance, therefore not able to start stake in governance. Bug seems to be something about infura. Seems like infura tells me status code 429 (too many requests). But that error comes from the first request already. IDK if problem is on infura side or ygov web app.

@Unknown Yes can see :)


[08/23/2020 8:41 AM] whyfoo#3310
ok, so if you want to stake manually it's a two step process


[08/23/2020 8:41 AM] Ilarion#9023
sure, im willing to stake this long term in gov so no prob


[08/23/2020 8:41 AM] whyfoo#3310
1. you need to approve the contract to spend your YFi and 2. you can run stake from the contract


[08/23/2020 8:42 AM] Ilarion#9023
Ok. I will try this in a while

when you approve, it's safe to use a super large number because otherwise you will need to approve again if you want to stake more

@Unknown ah, I have a ledger and connect to web3 does not have that option


[08/23/2020 9:32 AM] Shai#1550
With my yfi am I better off staking them on ygov.finance, or depositing them in the yvault? No way to double dip by eg staking yyfi on ygov?


[08/23/2020 9:42 AM] Ilarion#9023
no way to double dip currently.


[08/23/2020 9:44 AM] Shai#1550
Any idea where the better roi is currently?


[08/23/2020 9:47 AM] Ilarion#9023

Why we need both a vault and governance staking:

The $YFi vault protects #yearn from price decline; when prices are low, it scoops up cheap YFi and rewards depositors (currently 8% APY)

$YFi governance staking is how you earn the profit generated by Yearn ($70k/day currentl...

[08/23/2020 10:25 AM] whyfoo#3310
so the governance staking rewards are denominated in a basket of stablecoins (yCRV) vs the YFi vault, which is denominated in YFi. Because of YFi price volatility it's impossible to say which is a better roi if that makes sense.

@popcornkirby indeed


[08/23/2020 12:02 PM] Shai#1550
I wish governance staking could be done by both yfi and yyfi. Any reason not to allow that? Would encourage even more yfi to go into the yfi vault...


[08/23/2020 12:03 PM] whyfoo#3310
@Unknown the YFi vault is lent out, so the borrowers are able to vote

[08/23/2020 12:04 PM] whyfoo#3310
@Unknown this so you can't have a situation where people can vote twice if that makes sense

Got it. Makes sense


[08/23/2020 12:04 PM] Shai#1550
Unless we allow staking only via yyfi...


[08/23/2020 12:06 PM] whyfoo#3310
well ... rewards from the whole yearn ecosystem are denominated in yCRV, and those get paid to governance staked YFi

@Unknown really, can not do the connect to web3 it needs metamask , fortmatic or portis


[08/23/2020 12:08 PM] whyfoo#3310
@Unknown ok, so I don't have a ledger, does that mean when you click on Connect to Web your ledger interface never pops up?


[08/23/2020 12:08 PM] Ilarion#9023
yes i cannot form the connection with ledger with this method


[08/23/2020 12:08 PM] whyfoo#3310
@Unknown if so, I'd say you might be better off moving your funds to a supported wallet until such time as it's available

@Unknown yYFi is really just an immune system function, to protect governance


[08/23/2020 12:11 PM] whyfoo#3310
so for example, Binance is an imminent threat, they have ~13% of our governance tokens


[08/23/2020 12:11 PM] whyfoo#3310
big problem


[08/23/2020 12:11 PM] whyfoo#3310
what we need is people who believe in the project to log into Binance, buy YFi, withdraw and either stake in ygov or deposit into YFi vault

you can farm it now in the YVault pool

[08/23/2020 8:20 PM] saltyfacu#1111
That happens when you health factor goes below 1, so you collateral is not enough


[08/23/2020 8:20 PM] saltyfacu#1111
You are delegating a vault, the strategy takes credit on the deposited collateral

[08/24/2020 2:22 PM] GtGug8#8494

cream is the only one AFAIK


[08/25/2020 3:38 AM] snow.white#9992
so is it possible to use yfi as collateral to borrow ycrv and then put that in the ycrv vault?


[08/25/2020 4:41 AM] popcornkirby#7582
yes but you need to borrow stable coin, then convert it into yCRV before you deposit in the ycrv vault


[08/25/2020 4:41 AM] popcornkirby#7582
1 more step


[08/25/2020 4:45 AM] snow.white#9992
why, on cream you can borrow ycrv


[08/25/2020 5:28 AM] BTC $100K#5136
if I put DAI in yearn I get 50% APT and yDAI


[08/25/2020 5:29 AM] BTC $100K#5136
and should I put this yDAi in curve and get ycrv to put in yearn again to get 95% APY?


[08/25/2020 5:29 AM] BTC $100K#5136
Does it mean I will get 95%+50% = 145% APY?


[08/25/2020 6:14 AM] 0xGasper#7576

@Unknown Good question, but this is Yearn 😉


[08/25/2020 8:12 AM] saltyfacu#1111
> Does it mean I will get 95%+50% = 145% APY?
@Unknown Remember that APY is super unstable, strategies change


[08/25/2020 8:13 AM] saltyfacu#1111
> Hi, can someone explain to me how ayLINK had >50% APY? the current daily APY is 3% and looking at the transactions of the current strategy for the last 8 days, nothing is different than the last three days.  So how come the daily APY in those last 8 days was so high?
@0xGasper APY is unstable, prices are volatile and APRs too


[08/25/2020 8:40 AM] banana4#4571
Is the overall sense that yVault ROI will increase on the 28th because of the voting lock?


[08/25/2020 8:43 AM] saltyfacu#1111
Depends also on CRV price


[08/25/2020 8:43 AM] banana4#4571
But the 2.5x boost will mean the strategy will have more CRV to sell no?

what does 5% performance fee on subsidized gas mean ?


[08/25/2020 3:05 PM] Run Gun#7128
if i deposit 100 alink do i have to pay 5 link to exit ?


[08/25/2020 4:44 PM] mocktail#4704
There are two fees: One which is .5% on withdrawal (0.5 alink in your example).


[08/25/2020 4:45 PM] mocktail#4704
Another which is 5% of whatever is earned by the strategy


[08/25/2020 4:46 PM] mocktail#4704
the second fee is there to help pay for gas, because it costs gas to actually execute the strategy


[08/25/2020 4:46 PM] mocktail#4704
So they call it a "subsidized gas fee"

@Unknown and how often does it get applied to my stake?

doesn't work like that. The strategy makes profits, you're entitled to a share of the profits when you exit

@Unknown it's pretty much continuosly so if you're asking do i have to wait a certain time until i get rewards, the answer would be no


[08/26/2020 1:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
but as Matt says you have to claim them so you have to exit with a portion of your funds, you can't just take the rewards alone (unless you make the calculations and only take what you got ontop..)

Hey there, pretty new to yearn but super interested. I just wanted to play around and see how this all works. But it seems I am doing something wrong. For example, I bought Link and staked it at Aave for aLink and put these aLink into the vault at yearn.finance.

@Joshi the way that the strategy for link works it's quite possible that the returns aren't continuos but you'll get a whole bunch every x days. i wouldnt worry

@Unknown it shouoldn't happen. If it happens, there will be no compensation. It's part of the risk


[08/26/2020 3:25 PM] Joshi#3763
If one would want to enter the yCurve Vault, is there any disadvantage by doing it with Zapper (Like going from DAI directly into yyCurve) over staking DAI for yCurve at curve.fi and then staking it into the Vault?  Is there any yield missed out or risk involved with the Zapper Route since it seems to be cheaper and even easier.

@Joshi Not at all. You can use Zapper and you will save some gas 🙂


[08/26/2020 3:59 PM] iMr.Grey#0487
Ok, but how do I see exactly my returns? The site you've sent shows only general values @Unknown


[08/26/2020 4:02 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown My site http://feel-the-yearn.app/ can show your holdings in the vaults as the vault token as well as USD.  But you would need to remember how much you deposited to work out your returns. Calculating your returns automatically is much harder as would have to determine whenever you've deposited or withdrawn and how much your holdings were worth at those times.


[08/26/2020 4:06 PM] iMr.Grey#0487

@Unknown who said it's better ? It's different. If you're bullish on CRV, stake in Curve. If not, use the vault.

2nd question and just to be sure: it is NOT possible to both be getting rewards from sBTC pool AND the year sBTC vault at the same time, correct? If  stake my crvBTC in Yearn's vault, then I won't earn CRV from Curve anymore, but will "only" get my rewards from the Yearn vault. Am I right?

@Stefan not really. what do you need?


[08/28/2020 4:33 AM] Stefan#6148
@Unknown The other day, I deposited DAI in both the "earn" and the "vaults" section. I am now trying to talk to your smart contracts, but I have trouble understanding what is what. As far as I can tell, what I deposited into "earn" is in the v2 Yield Tokens registry (not the v3 Yield Tokens registry). What I deposited into "vaults" is in 0xacd43e627e64355f1861cec6d3a6688b31a6f952 but such address is not to be found in your tech docs. Am I missing something?

@Unknown Gotcha. One more question: is there a controller contract that resolves these v1/v2/v3 addresses somewhere? Or is it okay for me to hardcode them in my dapp?


[08/28/2020 4:46 AM] twinstrust#9020

[08/28/2020 4:50 AM] Stefan#6148
> it's not that v3 is better/newer but uses the curve busd LP
@Unknown out of curiosity, are the v2 (aka y.curve.fi) and v3 (aka busd.curve.fi) contracts ABI compatible?


[08/28/2020 4:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Stefan i'd guess so but you should check in etherscan to be sure

@Unknown thanks for your help so far 👍

@Unknown np, i sent you feedback in dm.


[08/28/2020 5:41 AM] Stefan#6148
@Unknown is `getPricePerFullShare()` the current yToken price, in underlying (eg. DAI) terms? in other words: does this thing allow me to "translate" my yDAI balance into my DAI balance?


[08/28/2020 5:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Stefan no, simply put if you had invested at the start of the vault, your tokens would've increased by that factor. so initial * price  = final. which is why when you deposit afterwards the initial amount is adjusted (reduced) so that the formula holds


[08/28/2020 5:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
wait, reading your post again i think it's pretty much what you said


[08/28/2020 5:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
the increase in the price will be reflected in the increment of your yDai **tokens**


[08/28/2020 5:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
so yeah pretty much what u said


[08/28/2020 5:56 AM] Stefan#6148
@Unknown in essence, I will want to display my balance in the pool in underlying asset and I am hoping `getPricePerFullShare()` will allow me to do that


[08/28/2020 5:57 AM] Stefan#6148
because `balanceOf` gives me my yDAI balance (not my DAI balance)


[08/28/2020 5:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Stefan the value in parenthesis is the current number of tokens


[08/28/2020 5:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
wait balanceOf gives you the number you deposited initially


[08/28/2020 5:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
you'd go balanceOf * getPricePer..

You he's is doing is taking the block number from one day (or week) ago and the compare the price of the share from one day (or week) ago with the current one


[08/28/2020 9:51 AM] saltyfacu#1111
Get the block number one day ago:
`const oneDayAgoBlockNumber = parseInt(await getBlockNumberFromTimestamp(now - 60 * 60 * 24));
`

Get current price of share
`const currentPricePerFullShare = await vaultContract.getPricePerFullShare();
`

Get price of share one day ago 
`const pastPricePerFullShare = await vaultContract.getPricePerFullShare({blockTag : oneDayAgoBlockNumber});
`

Calculate APY:
`ROI_day = (currentPricePerFullShare / pastPricePerFullShare - 1) * 100;
`

you have to claim within the lock period (about 3 days). vote again.

All right. May I suggest that it would be much more easy if it were clearly written?
It actually says « You need to have voted recently in order to claim rewards ». 
Why not replacing it by « You need to have voted within the last 3 days to claim rewards »?


[08/28/2020 1:40 PM] zai#0518
because it's counted in blocks and you can't convert blocks into days, because they get mined at various intervals.

Are there some issues with this strategy? I ate the gas and .05 to place based on the 60%v ROI rate and now it's looks like it's 50% but the current performance is more like 2.25466% currently.

Hi guys, what is the difference between Vault holdings and strategy holdings? I couldn't find a reference.


[08/30/2020 1:46 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Vault and strategy are separate contracts.  Vaults are where you deposit and withdraw from. Strategy implements the active... strategy to earn with the deposited funds.


[08/30/2020 1:48 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Most often strategy will have almost all the funds except for a small buffer to enable smaller withdraws from vault to remain cheap.  Some times it will have a lesser amount if there is perceived risks to using all the funds.


[08/30/2020 1:49 PM] rock#6297
So when I see the strategy holding for YFI is 0, it means that the strategy is not active?


[08/30/2020 1:49 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
correct


[08/30/2020 1:49 PM] rock#6297

Regarding the governance voting. Is it worth it for someone who has little amount (say 0.5 YFI) to vote? because first, it won't have much of an impact on the result. Second, the gas prices might be higher than the YFI locked reward.

@Unknown I struggle to follow everything so not 100% sure on the details.  But currently the new strategy is funneling 10% of CRV off which I believe is / will be locked to boost returns.


[08/30/2020 2:17 PM] iMr.Grey#0487
Thanks! When it will go live? @Unknown


[08/30/2020 2:17 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
the strategy is live already, but not 100% sure if the CRV is getting locked yet.


[08/30/2020 2:22 PM] iMr.Grey#0487
Got you, thanks!

Do I have to stake in order to vote on YFI governance?


[08/30/2020 2:52 PM] 0x0x#6091
Also, if I lend my yfi into curve - can I then not vote/stake on Yfi interfaces?


[08/30/2020 2:55 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Yes, you have to stake in order to vote.


[08/30/2020 2:56 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown You can't lend YFI to curve, perhaps you mean something else?

Graham, can you answer the question about wallets, just above, please?


[08/30/2020 2:58 PM] mocktail#4704
I would highly recommend a wallet


[08/30/2020 2:58 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Agreed


[08/30/2020 2:58 PM] mocktail#4704
metamask super easy


[08/30/2020 2:58 PM] mocktail#4704
or hardware wallet (e.g. Ledger) if you have a lot of capital


[08/30/2020 2:58 PM] raincascadia#0295
But not Coinbase?


[08/30/2020 2:59 PM] mocktail#4704
If you have tokens at coinbase, very easy to send them to your metamask wallet


[08/30/2020 2:59 PM] raincascadia#0295
What happens with yUSDC, etc.?  I still don't understand how this works.

[08/30/2020 3:17 PM] raincascadia#0295
So, you don't need a wallet for yUSDC, etc.?  These tokens stay in the vault or with yEarn?  Still not clear.


[08/30/2020 3:53 PM] micciont#3958
So i connected the Coinbase Wallet with yearn finance, how do i invest now? 🙂


[08/30/2020 4:00 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown If you invest USDC into the vault, then you will receive yUSDC into your wallet, This is how your share of the vaults holdings in tracked.


[08/30/2020 4:01 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Invest at https://yearn.finance/vaults (if you want the higher return active strategies) or https://yearn.finance/earn (for lower return passive interest)


[08/30/2020 4:03 PM] micciont#3958
@Unknown Thanks for the answer, i connected the Wallet, how do i transfer it now to the "earn" section?


[08/30/2020 4:03 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
You need to visit that url from the coinbase wallet (if I understand you correctly)


[08/30/2020 4:04 PM] micciont#3958
Yes, i want to transfer coins from Coinbase to the "Earn" section. So everytime i buy now USDC i automatically get some YUSDC's?


[08/30/2020 4:05 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
" transfer coins from Coinbase" - just checking, you mean from coinbase wallet right?


[08/30/2020 4:05 PM] micciont#3958
exactly


[08/30/2020 4:06 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
So you want to invest in vaults? or earn?


[08/30/2020 4:06 PM] micciont#3958
im pretty lazy, guess the passive interest suits me more


[08/30/2020 4:07 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Neither is more effort than the other. Active is higher reward and potentially higher risk


[08/30/2020 4:07 PM] autodash#8490
I put 50$ worth of USDC in the vault and received 50 yUSDC.. does this mean that the USDC is earning interest now ? Or do I need to put this is the Y pool to start earning it.?


[08/30/2020 4:08 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Yes, you are now earning returns


[08/30/2020 4:10 PM] autodash#8490
Awesome.. Pretty neat.. I assume the returns will be in yUSDC as well and that will be redeemable for USDC..? 😊


[08/30/2020 4:10 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
Your yUSDC amount will remain constant, but its price (amount is USDC it is worth) will increase over time


[08/30/2020 4:11 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
You can check the figure in brackets to see how much USDC it is worth at https://yearn.finance/vaults or at https://feel-the-yearn.app you can see it converted into USD


[08/30/2020 4:12 PM] autodash#8490
Thanks for this.. :) ..


[08/30/2020 4:13 PM] raincascadia#0295
Yes, thanks, Graham.  I just wonder if Coinbase accepts yUSDC.


[08/30/2020 4:14 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Coinbase the service doesnt accept it. But the wallet app will handle any ERC20 token, even if they don't show it in the UI


[08/30/2020 4:14 PM] raincascadia#0295
Also, justinmm was showing $2000 fees and I'm wondering if Zap would eliminate this or if using Metamask would be better...

[08/30/2020 4:16 PM] autodash#8490
I went the MetaMask way.. Lots to decipher in the transactions though.. Sometime some really high value ones show up as well.. Happened with me.. 😅

sorry guys, what is the difference between Earn and Vaults?


[08/30/2020 7:53 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown Earn takes your deposit and lends it out at the best interest rate it can find and will switch as better rates become available. Vaults are more active,  currently they use your deposit to farm tokens which they then sell to increase they vaults native holdings.  Vaults are higher returns and potentially higher risk


[08/30/2020 8:05 PM] Robert#0364
@Unknown Thanks Graham.


[08/30/2020 8:36 PM] bit#6418
what is the usdc vault doing vs yusdc LP vault?


[08/31/2020 12:04 AM] VivaLaRobo#0836
connected coinbase wallet, 100 USDC deposited and I have been trying to convert it to y.curve.fi. The notification pops up on my phone, i approve it. it transfers out the ~$3 ETH fee... then nothing. The USDC stays in my wallet and the website doesn't change. It takes my ETH though. What am I doing wrong? Lost $6 so far


[08/31/2020 1:50 AM] ase#7595
If someone deposits ETH from a coinbase wallet into a vault and over time their vaults native holdings increase, how does one transfer those holdings back into ETH and back into their Coinbase wallet? Basically, how do you remove your earning from a vault?


[08/31/2020 4:00 AM] ONI#6888
you withdrawal


[08/31/2020 4:00 AM] ONI#6888
then you use curve.fi to withdrawal ycrv into say dai

In the FAQs, it says that when you invest in the USDC vault, you get yyUSDC in return, yet on the vault page it shows yUSDC.  This is very confusing.

Hello I was attempting to withdraw from the yalink vault & gas limit on the transaction was 1.5 million. Is metamask misbehaving or do I really have to pay 200usd ? It was only around $15 usd to deposit, shouldn't deposit and withdraw have similar gas limits? What am I not understanding

How long does it take for the transaction to process


[09/02/2020 12:12 AM] saltyfacu#1111
Depends on gas


[09/02/2020 12:13 AM] ferda culture#9682
Well I sent the Eth that I wanted to for the vault


[09/02/2020 12:13 AM] ferda culture#9682
And it’s still showing on the website that I haven’t sent the Eth


[09/02/2020 12:14 AM] saltyfacu#1111
Is it confirmed?


[09/02/2020 12:14 AM] saltyfacu#1111
The tx?


[09/02/2020 12:14 AM] ferda culture#9682
Nah just pending


[09/02/2020 12:14 AM] ferda culture#9682
Could I bounce back


[09/02/2020 12:15 AM] saltyfacu#1111
That's the issue


[09/02/2020 12:15 AM] saltyfacu#1111
How many gwei did you put for gas?


[09/02/2020 12:15 AM] ferda culture#9682
489


[09/02/2020 12:18 AM] saltyfacu#1111
Weird. Have some patience, it should go through


[09/02/2020 12:18 AM] ferda culture#9682
Okay I hope so


[09/02/2020 12:18 AM] ferda culture#9682
On the website it says I still have the funds


[09/02/2020 12:18 AM] ferda culture#9682
Idk it’s only been 7 min


[09/02/2020 12:19 AM] ferda culture#9682
And the Eth thing is new


[09/02/2020 12:20 AM] saltyfacu#1111
I believe it will


[09/02/2020 12:22 AM] ferda culture#9682
If it doesn’t does my coin bounce back to me?


[09/02/2020 12:22 AM] saltyfacu#1111
Yes


[09/02/2020 12:22 AM] saltyfacu#1111
You only lose the fee


[09/02/2020 12:22 AM] saltyfacu#1111
Not the eth


[09/02/2020 12:23 AM] ferda culture#9682

@Unknown I just deposited and it took less than 15 seconds

How do I actually use my $YFI to claim a portion of the withdrawal fees and is there somewhere I can see how much withdrawal fees are open to take?

Are Chainlink vaults disabled?


[09/02/2020 3:17 AM] neighbor#5328
After I hit the zap button  the transaction fee notification comes up and when I go to the advanced tab it says  "insufficient balance." I have enough to cover the fees. The save button is not available to click, and the confirm button is grayed-out too. Anyone know what is wrong?

@Unknown My understanding is that you have to stake in governance to accrue rewards, and then vote to unlock them

Hi, can I send my yeth to someone else and then they get all the interest due when they deposit the yETH?


[09/02/2020 8:15 AM] rosewood#3035
As well as the ETH equivalent ofc.


[09/02/2020 8:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Unknown havent you just now received an answer on this in the other channel?


[09/02/2020 8:23 AM] rosewood#3035
I still am not sure so was just trying to calrify. Apologies. 
So I can send my yETH to another address and the depositer of the yETH gets the same ETH value for deposited yETH plus interest?
Appreciate the help TY.


[09/02/2020 8:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
it's not so much that you get interest but the value of the yEth increases so yeah you can send it and they  can then go to yearn and get the  initial eth + return


[09/02/2020 8:27 AM] rosewood#3035
Ah Eureka I see!
Apologies for my ignorance.
Thank you very much.
Thats much better isnt it :)

Can I deposit USDC on curve to receive curve iEarn LP tokens, and then go to yearn.finance/vaults and stake them in the Y curve vault?


[09/02/2020 9:46 AM] zigos#7561
@Unknown that's the correct way


[09/02/2020 9:50 AM] zigos#7561
@kala I have the same problem when depositing yCRV. metamask always shows very high gas fees. If I changed the gas to a lower number, transactions always failed. (I have tried 1500000 gas limit, still failed)


[09/02/2020 9:51 AM] Web3Zero#2529
Thank you. After I deposit USDC at curve for iEarn LP tokens, do the LP tokens appear in my metamask automatically?


[09/02/2020 9:51 AM] zigos#7561
@Unknown yes


[09/02/2020 9:52 AM] Web3Zero#2529
Sorry for noob questions, but are iEarn LP tokens = yCRV?


[09/02/2020 9:56 AM] zigos#7561
curve Y pool LP token = yCRV, then you can deposit it to Yearn.


[09/02/2020 10:01 AM] Web3Zero#2529
Thank you. And the Y Liquidity Gauge on Curve is different to the  Y curve Vault on the yearn site, right?


[09/02/2020 10:02 AM] zigos#7561
right, different output


[09/02/2020 10:06 AM] Web3Zero#2529
Last question. I could also just jump onto zapper with my USDC and go straight into the Y curve vault from that site right, without doing a 2 step process we just discussed using the curve and yearn sites?


[09/02/2020 10:22 AM] zigos#7561
no, zapper and vault are different products


[09/02/2020 10:25 AM] dreasy#9315
Do you think yearn will still follow through with the snx vaults?


[09/02/2020 10:25 AM] dreasy#9315
i thought it got voted in by governance


[09/02/2020 10:30 AM] Web3Zero#2529
@zigos this is from the zapper.fi site. Kind of looks like a way to enter the Y curve vault?

Is this the lowest cost entry do you think? Compared to getting yCRV from curve then depositing it at Yearn.finance?

the pool is still showing my  balance in ycrv and pasta, but i am unable to withdraw them


[09/02/2020 4:16 PM] zai#0518
you use the pool token to withdraw the underlying assets from the respective uniswap pool


[09/02/2020 4:24 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
it's in my wallet, yet I still liquitidy in that pool, which shouldn't be the case


[09/02/2020 4:26 PM] zai#0518
that is exactly how it is - pool token in your wallet, liquidity in the pool


[09/02/2020 4:26 PM] zai#0518
liquidity in your wallet - no pool token


[09/02/2020 4:28 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
is there any way to get the liquidity out? I've tried zapper, but that'll cost 250$ and the funds in the contract are worth half of it

@Fluchtzwerg yes, you shouldn't move around with these gas prices. only 🐋  can. 
go to uniswap directly, and try to withdraw your liquidity through them. see if it's cheaper.

@Unknown don't type stuff in there, click max, or the %


[09/02/2020 4:31 PM] zai#0518
you are probably using a comma or something else that's not a number


[09/02/2020 4:32 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
> go to uniswap directly
@zai I've tried that, withdraw liquidity nowhere to be seen, that's why I thought zapper might do the trick


[09/02/2020 4:34 PM] zai#0518
it's under the "pool" tab at the top of the little window, next to swap


[09/02/2020 4:35 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
yes, that's where I was


[09/02/2020 4:36 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
but i can only add liquidity, not withdraw


[09/02/2020 4:36 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
wait, i'll try again


[09/02/2020 4:40 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652

but when choosing the pairs to find the pool the search engine of uni doesnt find it

but it just takes me to the page above


[09/02/2020 4:46 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
just add  liquidity, no claim, no withdraw


[09/02/2020 4:46 PM] Fluchtzwerg#7652
shows my current shares of the pool at the bottom of the page


[09/02/2020 4:53 PM] zai#0518
if you have the right wallet connected and it sees your tokens, then it should allow you to withdraw


[09/02/2020 4:54 PM] zai#0518
you may still be staking, and only have the dust from the pool token in your wallet. the bulk of the token is still staked


[09/02/2020 4:54 PM] zai#0518
if not, then jsut wait for gas to get cheaper and use zapper

trying to deposit to vault from but transaction not going through.  Keep getting WalletConnect message "gas*fee + value = insufficient", even though left .2 Eth gap for trans fee.  Any ideas?

Any thoughts on why my transaction is queued for an hour now. Am attempting to deposit in eth vault

recommended gas price is lower now


[09/02/2020 6:18 PM] Llew#6015
Any previous transactions that haven't cleared yet?  If so, you'll need to replace those earlier ones with a higher gas fee and the same nonce.

Looks like lots of unanswered questions above about the ETH Vault - there are no returns being added to the balance or showing up on dashboards. Is there anyone from support who can actually answer whats going on with the APY on ETH vault and if it is actually paying any returns at the moment?

@kala did you get the gas issue resolved? Was trying to deposit using TrustWallet but unsuccessful.  FYI, when connecting wallet to deposit, the "trustwallet" choice also highlights the "metemask".  I was told that i had to use "walletConnect" choice to be able to connect.  I don't now if that has implications for wiithdrawing -- i.e. instead of metamask/trustwallet, perhaps walletConnect has to be used. (but also know, that though i was able to connect to the vault, i am still have issues depositing -- my trustwallet app is telling me i don't have enough funds.  If the trans fee is 5-6 eth as you seeing for withdrawal, then that might have been my issue.)

?


[09/02/2020 8:05 PM] aptnow#5951
is was trying to deposit from trustwallet, would only allow me to connect using WalletConnect.  When tried to deposit, though leaving .3 eth balance in my wallet, i was getting a message that i did not have sufficient to cover "gas*fee+value".  My take away was that the trans fee is more than .3 eth.

Quick question! I put into the ETH vault, but not the WETH. The platform is showing I have the same amount in each vault. Any clues?


[09/02/2020 9:56 PM] mickaphd#1508
It's just a duplicate you didn't double your stack! In the yETH vault you can choose to deposit ETH, that will be directly transformed in yWETH, or you can deposit WETH that will also transformed in yWETH. So it doesn't change anything, it's just that you have the choice of deposit

@3B1B.eth (💎🙌,💎🙌) Im not a yearn.finance pro, but i think the limit of 30K was already distributed, there arent more YFI to distribute. Users can vote to change that if im not wrong, but they wont. If im correct, staking YFI gives you CRV or yCRV rewards.

Yup gotta cough up those 30k for one token.  But you don't need one entire one to be able to vote or form part of the community (for which you don't even need any YFI at all, it's free- awesome right??)

@Unknown 
Thank you. What, behind the scene, what are the basic differences? What does happen to my money in both cases?


[09/03/2020 7:54 AM] DegenDeFiTendie#0123
@Unknown As always, im not 100% sure, but i know the vaults move your investment from pool to pool, looking for the more profitable, they also borrow DAI using the ETH as collateral, between the fees, the moves and the collateral you can lose value. With earn i think they just lend, which is more stable and safe but less profitable. If im wrong in something please correct me.

@Unknown Thanks for answering guys. What are these additional utilities and can you please explain the process behind the curtains? 

I send ETH (which I believe to be collateral for MakerDao), which generates DAI. So how does WETH come into play here?

@Unknown The reason you need wETH is to be able to trade ETH for other ERC-20 tokens on decentralized platforms like yearn.

So basically this allows yWeth to be traded for yETH, which is the reward to using ETH as collateral ?

If so, (correct me if I'm wrong) ETH (as collateral), is generating DAI, which is traded for yWeth, which can be traded for yETH which is the reward for the collateral placed in the vault?

and that's generating DAI, which goes into the yDAI strategy, the profit then is used to buy more WETH

@Unknown yes, WETH is the ERC20 compatible version of ETH. The problem is that ETH, weirdly, is not ERC20 compatible

> @Unknown yes, WETH is the ERC20 compatible version of ETH. The problem is that ETH, weirdly, is not ERC20 compatible
@saltyfacu Apparently this is being worked on. Eventually WETH will be made redundant. But for now, WETH is the way to go apparently.


[09/03/2020 10:37 AM] saltyfacu#1111

This is the best explainer I’ve found for how yETH yVaults in @iearnfinance:

1️⃣Open a CDP
2️⃣Use DAI to earn interest + fees via @CurveFinance Y Pool
3️⃣Then earn CRV via staking in Curve DAO to make returns
4️⃣And lastly use all profits to buy more ETH

Nice job @sassal0x!...

Hey guy! How yEth vault protects itself from liquidation. Does it repays the borrowed DAI, which it has already staked in Curve. Or does it put in more Ether in makerDao.

@Unknown I was talking about yCRV ( Curve LP token), Say I invested 1000$ worth of USDT, I received 950.2 yCRV. Which tells yCRV ~ 1.05 $. Which is also average value of the pool token shown of Curve.fi. My question is from where this price is derived?
And If I were to unstake 950.2 yCRV. will I get 950.2*1.05 ~ 1000$ worth of USDT back

@UnknownyUSD price in yCrv also varies.? So I have fixed yUSD which I received from vault. And If I burn yUSD to receive yCRV I would get initial staked yCRV + farmed yCRV.?

@RZoro0720 
exactly but here the yUSD price is referring to the number of yCRV tokens each yUSD token is worth, so rn i think it's about 1.07, in$ you'd get (approx) yUSDtokens * 1.07 * 1.05 $

The price increase of yCrv (Curve) comes from the fees they gather but that's a different project.

@Unknown  1.07, in$ you'd get (approx) yUSDtokens * 1.07 * 1.05 $ This would give me inital staked yCRV not yCRV + farmed yCRV?

> How can I be sure that the site won't just vanish tomorrow?
@Unknown The site is just a front-end. 
You're holding the private keys so you can still interact with the smart contract. You can still withdraw, if that's what you're worried about. 

But there is ALWAYS, smart contract risks in terms of bugs, backdoors etc. It helps if you understand code and go through it yourself.

YEARN FINANCE And YFI Token Explained | DeFi, Ethereum
Confused about how Yearn Finance works? And what is the YFI token all about? You’ll find out all of this and more in this video. 

Okay, let’s start with what Yearn Finance is all about. 

The main element of Yearn Finance is the Yearn protocol. 
The Yearn protocol, in essence...

Thanks for the links
I will come back with more questions :)


[09/03/2020 7:50 PM] Jeyrantur#2925
Btw can you give me some examples of bugs or back doors on smart contracts?


[09/03/2020 7:52 PM] gnarlysagan#3761
posted this in #vaults but reposting here, it might be more appropriate - so ive been reading about yearn lately - i wanted to wait a while before venturing in - Im pretty comfortable with the idea now. One thing I am wondering is about the contracts and the vaults. If I have my yUSD in curve.fi/y LP  vault, and another contract or set of contracts is found to be susceptible to attack (lets say the yEth vault) - would my yUSD in curve.fi/y LP vault be fine?
or is it when one vault goes down like this they all are affected?


[09/03/2020 7:55 PM] zai#0518
vaults are sets of independent smart contracts.
but your question misses the point. if a vault with hundreds of thousands of ETH blows up, the security of other vaults' contracts probably doesn't matter - we will all die anyway


[09/03/2020 7:59 PM] sweetpotato#2424
we would not be able to see the earning from vault until we withdraw?  another question, if we stake for example yalink elsewhere, we cannot see it in vault, but we are still earning, correct?


[09/03/2020 8:00 PM] gnarlysagan#3761
@zai like it would send eth price in a crazy spiral? or it would kill YFI? or it would kill the individual YFI vaults?


[09/03/2020 8:00 PM] zai#0518
nobody is smart enough to know


[09/03/2020 8:00 PM] 0xBluePartyHat#8888
Hey guys, is it possible to see rewards if you have provided liquidity on Y curve vault? I did it through zapper.fi.


[09/03/2020 8:00 PM] gnarlysagan#3761
oh heh 🙂 i see


[09/03/2020 8:04 PM] gnarlysagan#3761
i would get that there might be a cascade of things becuase of how much is being managed by YFI - but what i dont understand is - and this might be a basic question - if im collateralizing yUSDC - how at risk are the actual USDC underling it due to other YFI contracts hypotetically being attacked. If the USDC maintains its peg and its just being used for collateral accross curve, I would imagine it would be safer than other vaults or tokens that are not based in stable coins

{Reactions}
peepoyes 

[09/03/2020 8:04 PM] gnarlysagan#3761
although this might be my lack of understanding of how curve works or this YFI vault


[09/03/2020 8:05 PM] gnarlysagan#3761
the way I thought it is acting is to switch stable coins (and synthetic USD) depending on which one is giving the highest interst rate


[09/03/2020 8:05 PM] Deleted User#0000

@Unknown curve doesn't hold usdc, it holds a ytoken of it. usdc itself is somewhere else looking for yield for you.


[09/03/2020 8:15 PM] gnarlysagan#3761
ah ok - i probably need to understand curve a little more, thanks for the replies

I completed a transaction from aLink to yaLink about an hour ago and it’s not showing up in my wallet.  The status shows “success”, but it’s not there.  Anyone have any ideas or has this question been asked a million times?  Any assistance would be appreciated.


[09/03/2020 9:00 PM] Weston#4287
I’m new to discord.  Am I supposed to @ someone specifically for this question?


[09/03/2020 9:06 PM] vany#0365
no, im not familiar with the link pools, but someone will come by and answer you soon, its dinner time in the US


[09/03/2020 9:07 PM] Ricky🏴#5694
@Unknown you have to custom add the token to metamask?


[09/03/2020 9:07 PM] Weston#4287
I’m on trustwallet


[09/03/2020 9:19 PM] Weston#4287
@vany @Ricky🏴 Thank you for the responses.  I’ll try to be patient on this one


[09/03/2020 9:19 PM] vany#0365
👍


[09/03/2020 9:22 PM] Weston#4287
The “block confirmations” number keeps going up if that means anything.  I’m unfamiliar with reading those.


[09/03/2020 9:25 PM] vany#0365
the tx on etherscan should show a token going into your wallet


[09/03/2020 9:29 PM] Weston#4287
Well, Yearn.finance is now showing the yaLink.  That 2 hrs had me a little concerned.  That makes me feel a little better.  Should it show up in my Trustwallet?


[09/03/2020 9:37 PM] vany#0365
you will have to look on etherscan, i doubt trustwallet supports the underlying coin to a leveraged coin


[09/03/2020 9:38 PM] Weston#4287
Etherscan will tell me this info?  It will tell me if my wallet supports yaLink?


[09/03/2020 9:40 PM] vany#0365
no. so when you deposit your coin into yearn they send you a coin in return as a placeholder. like when you deposit ycrv into the y vault it gives you yUSD. Etherscan is good about showing literally all the coins in your wallet, trustwallet probably only shows supported tokens on it unless you add it manually


[09/03/2020 9:40 PM] vany#0365
I dont use trustwallet so im not sure how they work


[09/03/2020 9:41 PM] Weston#4287
Ah.  I gotcha!  I’m sorry.  I misunderstood what you were saying.


[09/03/2020 9:41 PM] ONI#6888
I bet trustwallet didnt use enough gas


[09/03/2020 9:41 PM] ONI#6888
so it took a while


[09/03/2020 9:41 PM] ONI#6888
gas prices are crazy right now so it could be it took 2 hours for it to be processed


[09/03/2020 9:41 PM] ONI#6888
best place to check what is happening is etherscan input your address and u can see


[09/03/2020 9:42 PM] ONI#6888
if your using a mobile wallet make sure yet set the gas accordingly


[09/03/2020 9:45 PM] Weston#4287
Thanks for replying.  If I don’t respond for a bit it’s because I’m trying to pull up my wallet in etherscan and decipher it.  I’ve always just trusted wallets with an idiot-proof ui.


[09/03/2020 9:46 PM] Weston#4287
I’ve always just basically gone from coinbase to cold storage.  That’s it.


[09/03/2020 9:46 PM] ONI#6888
does it show in yearn you deposited?


[09/03/2020 9:49 PM] Weston#4287
My wallet on eitherscan is showing the Yean yaLink with the total of yaLink deposited, but it‘s grayed out and there’s no total value in USD showing.


[09/03/2020 9:49 PM] Weston#4287
This is making me feel a little better


[09/03/2020 9:49 PM] ONI#6888

@Unknown i cannot see it, because the yycrv, and yalink i stake it elsewhere


[09/03/2020 10:11 PM] sweetpotato#2424
i assume we still earn vault interest


[09/03/2020 10:12 PM] sweetpotato#2424
and on top of that earning interest on where i stake


[09/03/2020 10:16 PM] sweetpotato#2424
im assuming for example our quantity in yalink, yycrv stay constant, but its ratio changing back to alink, and ycrv will keep increasing

instead of doing 100% withdrawal button

try typing in the amount you want to withdrawal manually

ok, I'll try that


[09/03/2020 11:43 PM] ONI#6888
is metamask working for other functions?


[09/03/2020 11:43 PM] ONI#6888
like sending tokens and interacting with dapps?


[09/03/2020 11:43 PM] ONI#6888

if that doesnt work uninstall metamask and reinstall it

zapper.fi


[09/04/2020 12:59 AM] ONI#6888
your balance wont change but the amount your tokens worth will increase over time, that is your yield

I see others have had this issue via search, but I dont' see the resolution


[09/04/2020 1:11 AM] tallpall99#2749
@ONI That;s really hard to know the yield as the price fluctuates constantly.  I cannot tell if the balance is changing because the yield is increasing the amount of eth i have or the price of Eth is fluctuating. You would think it would show your Eth increasing.

I will/ I get to the part where it says to "Generate Transaction" but since the wallet isn't connecting there isn't a "generate Transaction" button to hit lol. Send Transaction is at bottom but that's the last step.


[09/04/2020 3:35 AM] ONI#6888
uh


[09/04/2020 3:36 AM] ONI#6888
odd your metamask should connect fine


[09/04/2020 3:36 AM] ONI#6888
go to metamask


[09/04/2020 3:36 AM] ONI#6888
go to activity


[09/04/2020 3:36 AM] ONI#6888

[09/04/2020 3:38 AM] ONI#6888
go to the pc version and it will show ur pending trx i think


[09/04/2020 3:38 AM] ONI#6888
then u can just speed it up or cancel it


[09/04/2020 3:38 AM] Huddly#2528

Hi all, When I want to deposit my aLink I get a message on my metamask:
Alert: Tranaction Error Exception thrown in contract code, 
 but I can actually proceed  but I didn't.  Is this bug known?

when the gas fee is abnormally high it means error really

closer to 1.14 per token is more like it


[09/04/2020 5:07 AM] ONI#6888
maybe try to lower the deposit amount and make sure you have enough eth to cover gas?


[09/04/2020 5:07 AM] ONI#6888
also try disconnecting and reconnecting metamask


[09/04/2020 5:09 AM] ONI#6888
try clearing cookies and reinstalling metamask extension along with rebooting your computer


[09/04/2020 5:11 AM] ONI#6888
> closer to 1.14 per token is more like it
@Unknown 1.085

@ONI I  have enough ETH and I did close and open but did not completely reinstalled my Metamask extension. 
Although not being able to do the transaction directly with nano-s makes it a  bit worrying. 
Perhaps I wait until some one gets back  to me from the official team as I am depositing  serious amount can't risk it.


[09/04/2020 5:12 AM] ONI#6888
it can work with ledger


[09/04/2020 5:12 AM] ONI#6888
i use it fine


[09/04/2020 5:12 AM] FAB-IT-Solutions#9148

@ONI Did you deposit aLink? That is a seperate contract.


[09/04/2020 5:13 AM] ONI#6888
I havent used alink, but I've not heard of any reports that it doesnt work.

@ONI Trudat! I  just connected nano-s directly and it doesn't see  any of my balances.


[09/04/2020 5:16 AM] ONI#6888
probably on the wrong eth account


[09/04/2020 5:16 AM] ONI#6888
tho... not sure if you can switch eth accounts on ledger on yearn...


[09/04/2020 5:16 AM] ONI#6888

@ONI I think I will get rid of metamask extension all together and try again.

[09/04/2020 5:17 AM] twinstrust#9020
> what yield farming says
@ONI 1.085 x 1.06 (ycurve) = 1.14


[09/04/2020 5:17 AM] ONI#6888
ah... ok my brain hurts


[09/04/2020 5:18 AM] ONI#6888
why is ycrv added?


[09/04/2020 5:19 AM] ONI#6888
humm ok. isnt ycrv already factored into the 1.085 number tho?


[09/04/2020 5:20 AM] twinstrust#9020
no - in the yycrv token you have 1.085 ycrv tokens. 1 ycrv token = 1.06 USD


[09/04/2020 5:21 AM] twinstrust#9020
so 1 yycrv token represents 1.14 USD in value


[09/04/2020 5:23 AM] FAB-IT-Solutions#9148
I still can't connect directly with my Ledger. I think they make connection only with "Ledger legacy" and don't connect with "Ledger Live" format.  I remember this problem on Kyber. I even see that the address that is connected is wrong.


[09/04/2020 5:31 AM] ONI#6888

@ONI I've also figured out that the reason I was getting  the error with Metamask was that it couldn't handle the size of my transaction! At 25% of the original amount I am not getting any more errors.


[09/04/2020 5:41 AM] ONI#6888
ah


[09/04/2020 5:41 AM] ONI#6888
wait what do you mean?


[09/04/2020 6:05 AM] FAB-IT-Solutions#9148
> wait what do you mean?
@ONI (Using Metamask again "to  avoid Ledger error" ) Let's say I put 100  aLink and got the error but then changed it to 25 aLink and it worked. Then tried 50  aLink again the same error, so the amount of aLink was too high, perhaps generating excessive higher gas expenses?


[09/04/2020 6:08 AM] ONI#6888
odd


[09/04/2020 6:08 AM] ONI#6888
so you still have 70 ish alink in ur wallet?


[09/04/2020 6:08 AM] ONI#6888

@ONI At a time...  Although  I didn't follow through with the  error  as you've suggested.


[09/04/2020 6:14 AM] ONI#6888
yah dont do that


[09/04/2020 6:17 AM] ONI#6888
@Unknown you either have an approval problem or have stuff borrowed


[09/04/2020 6:18 AM] ONI#6888
make sure to check your collaterization ratio on aave


[09/04/2020 6:21 AM] FAB-IT-Solutions#9148
> make sure to check your collaterization ratio on aave
@ONI 1.4 , If I reach  it it would automatically liquidate and wont allow me to hlod aLink.


[09/04/2020 6:25 AM] FAB-IT-Solutions#9148
> @Unknown you either have an approval problem or have stuff borrowed
@ONI I see  your point now! Yes some borrowed stuff is there you are absolutely right


[09/04/2020 6:25 AM] ONI#6888
yah that could be a reason I can look into how revoke approvals


[09/04/2020 6:26 AM] FAB-IT-Solutions#9148
> yah that could be a reason I can look into how revoke approvals
@ONI I didn't realise when you borrow against your aLink it will lock it up at that level.


[09/04/2020 6:26 AM] ONI#6888
yah I think so


[09/04/2020 6:28 AM] FAB-IT-Solutions#9148
> yah I think so
@ONI In that  case the code should be updated in a way that when your click on 100% only allocate what is left over and not the whole amount that has borrowed portion.


[09/04/2020 6:29 AM] ONI#6888
yah good idea


[09/04/2020 6:40 AM] ONI#6888
"I see so deposit alink to the vault increases one’s ratio ok"


[09/04/2020 6:40 AM] ONI#6888
"yup, if he has put it up as collateral , once he deposits it it's as if he traded the token"

historical avg


[09/04/2020 6:44 AM] noobMaster#5530
Hi @ONI, I mean, for example if I put in 100yDAI and the avg interest is 5% today. Does that mean in 24 hours I get additional 5yDAI and it makes it 105yDAI in total?


[09/04/2020 6:44 AM] ONI#6888
no i meant that if you have 100 dai in the vault since it started


[09/04/2020 6:45 AM] ONI#6888
then in a year you would have 105 dai


[09/04/2020 6:45 AM] noobMaster#5530

where can we read about the YFI token distribution? I don't understand if it's still ongoing (by providing liquidity) or if it was capped at the 1 week  mark = rewarding only ultra early participants?!

[09/04/2020 9:10 AM] Morgan#0925
you just need to add the token for it (yWETH)

@ONI I think I know you.

@Morgan whats the contract address, etherscan address shows 0 balance


[09/04/2020 9:24 AM] marsipanimoukari#1871
needed to disconnect the wallet, restart browser, now everything looks normal.. that was weird scary 😆

after 2.5 days why my yalink earning over 40% apy, has less alink (shown in bracket) than when i was depositing?  does it already include the fees (it has 0.5% less which is the fees?)

Hello guys, can I ask about yeTH. If I used the yETH i have on my yearn vault as collateral in cream Finance. Will i still be able to get interest rate?


[09/04/2020 9:52 AM] Matterhorn#1591
I believe so, I haven't tried it myself but I do believe CREAM accepts yETH

is it necessary to have some etherium in my wallet to pay fees when using eth20 tokens? The approve button is never active when I try to do a transaction and I have plenty of usdc in my wallet.

@Unknown I haven't used coinbase wallet.. could you go into a little more detail on what you need

[09/04/2020 11:34 AM] Morgan#0925
it is calling that withdraw function and sending hex data.. so I think it would convert you out of the vault if you spent the gas for it


[09/04/2020 11:35 AM] Morgan#0925
I guess that's just what it looks like.. I don't want to spend the gas to withdraw and the withdraw fee myself but maybe someone that has done it can confirm

yweth

> If you look at the total. Even I’m trying to move one eth from yearn.finance
@Unknown That's ok


[09/04/2020 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeth


[09/04/2020 11:41 AM] Morgan#0925
no I don't think so @Unknown I'm looking at when you do the deposit and what it does is the deposit() then transfer() functions


[09/04/2020 11:41 AM] Morgan#0925
so withdraw() when successful should do a transfer() back


[09/04/2020 11:41 AM] saltyfacu#1111
@Unknown withdraw is a function, so it will not shown the ETH, just the gas. But you will receive the whole amount


[09/04/2020 11:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ok. Let me try to withdraw one now


[09/04/2020 11:42 AM] saltyfacu#1111

is that a glitch?


[09/04/2020 11:42 AM] Morgan#0925
no that's just how it works.. it's yWETH


[09/04/2020 11:42 AM] ferda culture#9682
but theres 2 pools


[09/04/2020 11:42 AM] Morgan#0925
is the actual token name


[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] saltyfacu#1111
WETH is the ERC20 compatible version of ETH


[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] ferda culture#9682
on the top pool it says i can withdraw yeth?


[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] saltyfacu#1111
It converts to WETH anyways


[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] saltyfacu#1111
yTOKEN is the vault token


[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] Morgan#0925
I'm guessing it is like that so you can deposit with WETH as well as regular eth


[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] ferda culture#9682
and the bottom i can withdraw yweth


[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000

[09/04/2020 11:43 AM] ferda culture#9682

@saltyfacu I asked similar questions about yWETH and yETH yesterday.
I know what WETH is and opened several vaults no MakerDao, I also own some WETH, and to be honest I still don't get how things work in yearn. 

E.g. on MakerDao, when you open a CDP you put ETH as collateral and borrow DAI.  Yearn is doing the same thing, but I still don't get why both my yETH and yWETH vaults show the same balance.


[09/04/2020 11:57 AM] FluffyRat#9678

It's the way it is because Andre likes it that way. 

If you can point me to an article or anything really, I'll read through it myself. It's something that's causing confusion for a lot of people and it's surprising to me that nobody seems to be able to explain it in a way that people understand, other than to point to "what WETH is" and things that don't answer the question.


[09/04/2020 12:13 PM] FluffyRat#9678
@saltyfacu I get that WETH makes tx fees much lower when interacting with other erc20's. And a lot of that is happening on yearn through the money robot.  So from a financial point I get why WETH is important. 

But why is it showing the balance in both vaults? I don't have any WETH on the same public key I send my ETH from to the yETH vault.


[09/04/2020 12:21 PM] saltyfacu#1111
@Unknown yes, that's confusing for some people but as we use WETH we give you the chance to withdraw WETH instead of ETH. It's not that you have the double. You can withdraw only one of them.

Andre has designed many strats in yearn, and I believe that if it's the tools he uses best, you will have better results with it. I mean by using WETH.

@saltyfacu Ahh think I get it. 
I deposit 5 ETH, this will show up on both my yETH vault and on my yWETH vault. I can withdraw either ETH or WETH. 

Same goes for if I deposit 5 WETH, it will show up on both my yETH and yWETH vault and again, I can withdraw either ETH or WETH. 

In any way, the balance is adjusted on both vaults one is deposited / withdrawn.

Is this aligned with what you're saying?


[09/04/2020 12:30 PM] saltyfacu#1111
@Unknown yes it is. It's exactly like that


[09/04/2020 12:31 PM] FluffyRat#9678

I have some questions about Link vault. 
i deposited to both Ylink and yalink vaults. 

ylink show any reward estiamtes and doesnt allow deposits. why?
is ylink vault operational?


[09/04/2020 1:16 PM] KO#5834
yLink vault has no current returns I believe. yaLink is the only Link based vault with returns at the moment.


[09/04/2020 1:17 PM] FreeFi#9642
so i should remove from ylink and place in yalink?


[09/04/2020 1:18 PM] FreeFi#9642
ylink is just sitting idle currently?


[09/04/2020 1:19 PM] KO#5834
For returns yes. yLink might be implemented sometime in the future. How much you spend on gas?


[09/04/2020 1:20 PM] FreeFi#9642
lots! dont recall exactly but $280 or so. on $15k usd value

@Unknown umm, yDAI vault has not been disabled (as far as I know). 
Are you sure you didn't set your tx too low?


[09/04/2020 3:44 PM] CrazySanta#4464
yeah I sent the transaction yesterday with a low gas fee so that is why has been taking that long

Deposits to yETH have been paused. ~70m DAI minted. Withdrawals unaffected. We will allow deposits again in the future. For now this is a high enough cap to balance between best profits and best risk adjustment.

@Unknown Can you elaborate? I don't see it that way. For the vault to be liquidated, ETH price has to go to less than $200

> @Unknown Can you elaborate? I don't see it that way. For the vault to be liquidated, ETH price has to go to less than $200
@saltyfacu  Correct but atm When Eth has been falling the vault has had its liquidation price adjusted. However if we get close to $198 there’s no more room left for adjustment. Not enough Dai to rebalance


[09/04/2020 5:36 PM] SUPERAWESOME#7676
Unless I’m missing something


[09/04/2020 6:12 PM] saltyfacu#1111
There's a long way to go to reach 198

Liquidation implies a 13% penalty on the debt. It's not that you lose all your money

[09/04/2020 10:42 PM] Deleted User#0000

you need to clear yearn cooked and go to the main screen switch you mm account to something else

[09/04/2020 10:51 PM] bit#6418
@ONI thx


[09/04/2020 10:52 PM] bit#6418
is the reason the vaults returns are higher than if we earned curve tokens ourselves


[09/04/2020 10:52 PM] bit#6418
because there vote lock to boost earnings in place for yearn vaults?


[09/04/2020 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Unknown can you please wait 30 min and try again


[09/04/2020 10:52 PM] CV8#7596

[09/04/2020 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
okay thanks


[09/04/2020 10:53 PM] ONI#6888
I dont think the boost is in. it shouldnt be higher or much higher than what it says on crv afaik


[09/04/2020 10:53 PM] ONI#6888
curve's site for corrisponding strats


[09/04/2020 10:55 PM] bit#6418
@ONI so how can it be earning higher than crv?


[09/04/2020 10:56 PM] bit#6418
it should be less due to the gas fees of the strategy


[09/04/2020 10:56 PM] bit#6418
at the very least


[09/04/2020 10:56 PM] bit#6418
am I missing somehting?


[09/04/2020 10:57 PM] ONI#6888
yah should be less but could be higher than an indiviual selling the crv themselves as it can help save gas on that


[09/04/2020 10:57 PM] ONI#6888
maybe the stats you are comparing are off


[09/04/2020 10:57 PM] bit#6418
y pool on crv is earning 54% yet the yearn vault is returing 87%


[09/04/2020 10:57 PM] ONI#6888
yfi.fyi has a few stats


[09/04/2020 10:58 PM] ONI#6888
those are historical avgs


[09/04/2020 10:58 PM] ONI#6888
on yearn main page


[09/04/2020 11:00 PM] bit#6418
maybe it's because the CRV is compounded through the strategy it's higher returns...


[09/04/2020 11:01 PM] bit#6418
But was hoping on getting more definitive info


[09/04/2020 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
@bit the % ROI displayed on yearn.finance is the average since the vault started, annualized


[09/04/2020 11:02 PM] ONI#6888
it is true that the vaults compound where the number listed on curve does not afaik


[09/04/2020 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
@bit do you know what kind of APY curve displays?


[09/04/2020 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
is it daily and annualized?


[09/04/2020 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
because if they take the rate for the last day and annualize it makes a big difference over if they take the average for the last week, month, whatever


[09/04/2020 11:08 PM] bit#6418
they say it's annualized


[09/04/2020 11:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes


[09/04/2020 11:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
but what timeperioud do they use to average


[09/04/2020 11:09 PM] bit#6418
not sure


[09/04/2020 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
well, they should tell you


[09/04/2020 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
because that makes a very big difference


[09/04/2020 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
anyways, our vault does perform better so it's correct that it shows a higher %. if it's that much, i don't know


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] bit#6418
how does the vault perform better than the protocol its using?


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] bit#6418
or pool


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
because it spends less on gas


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] bit#6418
do you mean the compounding effect?


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
no, that also


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
but since the vault has lots of funds


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] bit#6418
oh right, but their apys would take that into account


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
no


[09/04/2020 11:10 PM] bit#6418
wouldn't


[09/04/2020 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
our data is real historic data


[09/04/2020 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
theirs is estimated


[09/04/2020 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
and we dont know what timeframe they are using


[09/04/2020 11:11 PM] bit#6418
so taking the historic average and annualizing it


[09/04/2020 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
that's what we're doing yes


[09/04/2020 11:11 PM] bit#6418
ok

Any word yet on how often the yETH vault pays out yield? Any charts or plans to add it to yieldfarming.info? Been in there from day 1 and I'm not noticing yield coming back in? - and its not a small about of ETH I've put in so i'm pretty sure i would have seen the yield coming in by now


[09/04/2020 11:22 PM] Strategy#1694
I’m genuinely confused. I have $500 in my yDAI vault earning 88% interest. How often does that interest compound? Does the interest earned fluctuate? Or is it locked at what I originally had? When I withdraw, does my yDAI turn back to normal DAI?

@Unknown the price of your yTokens that represent the share of ETH don't increase at a given rate but depending on when the strategy finishes one iteration. My guess why you don't see any yield right now is because of the recent market crash not all DAI could be taken out of the vault that would've been possible

Hi Everyone - I have a question regarding the interest balance being shown on the yETH vault. Since the closure of the yETH vault, I noticed that my balance of ETH was not growing. What happened, it's almost as if it's not being calculated, but the interest rate continues to fluctuate. Thank you!

It's just defaulting to my first address

hi I have a question. I've heard that when someone has YFI they also earn something because of the yearn.finance.  what do we earn and how can we see it? is it by just having YFI or do I have to put it in a vault?


[09/05/2020 5:00 AM] Jeyrantur#2925

@Unknown In what way not working?

What do you see?


[09/05/2020 6:33 AM] ONI#6888
@Unknown yes if you stake yfi you get yield in the form of ycrv which comes from the revenue of the yearn ecosystem.


[09/05/2020 6:33 AM] ONI#6888
Currently stakers are making around 10% a year


[09/05/2020 6:33 AM] ONI#6888
You can also put you yfi into the vault but it's on pause until a new strategy comes out.

@ONI how much is good enough? and are the fees paid in ETH? I have only DAI in my wallet

it might be worth it for 500$ and over


[09/05/2020 8:13 AM] ONI#6888
1k is worth the fees in the sense of actually making a profit soon after gas fees


[09/05/2020 8:13 AM] Jeyrantur#2925
> fees can be up to 50$ to deposit depends on the vault
@ONI so each deposit is about 50$? for example if I put money three times in the same vault I have to pay 50$ each time?


[09/05/2020 8:13 AM] ONI#6888
normally you dont yield farm with less than 10k or 5k


[09/05/2020 8:13 AM] ONI#6888

Just tried this. Doesn't seem to work either. This is only on the yearn vault. I've tried uniswap and there are no issues.

Hi all, 
Sorry for this extreamly noobie question but if someone could explain to me that would be very much appreciated.

a. Is the amount of Dai I originally invested. 
b. Is a higher amount than a, Assuming this is the interest i've made over the past month. 

When I click withdraw I only get to withdraw a balance not b. Im i missing something or am I unable to do anything the b? If there is something I should be doing, What am I missing?

Thanks

@Unknown a = the amount of tokens that  you bought with your DAI; b = the quantity of DAI that the tokens currently represent. when you withdraw your tokens(a) you get (b) in your wallet

So DAI gets deposited and yDAI gets withdrawn, and the expectation is that you would need to sell the latter on uniswap or whatever?

@Unknown  I saw in another post it was about $12/day/YFI at the current rate so you're looking at $0.60/day I think.


[09/05/2020 9:23 PM] Anthony#9994
so after about 5 or so days of having my 40 ETH locked up in the Vault it looks like my yETH vault yield came in.... **$7 yield**.. 😑 I dont understand how this equates to 50% APY? I've asked this a few times and had no response... are there any admins or mods that can clearly answer if this is working by design or if something is broken?


[09/05/2020 9:27 PM] WhatNot23#1648
where did u see your $7 yield?

@🤮🤯🤔🙂 Ah thanks for the response bro


[09/05/2020 9:30 PM] Anthony#9994
> where did u see your $7 yield?
@WhatNot23 I basically screen shot the amount of ETH sitting in the vault about 5 days ago. 5 Days ago it was 39.1132 and today it just went up to 39.1517... so over 5 days its moved about $7


[09/05/2020 9:32 PM] WhatNot23#1648
The Eth changes in calue and is in brackets next to yeth above the withdraw button


[09/05/2020 9:33 PM] WhatNot23#1648
I checked mine and I'm at $20 interest in 4 days off way less eth that you


[09/05/2020 9:33 PM] Anthony#9994
correct, so you can see the change. the yETH value never changes, but the ETH in brackets has changed slightly - but nowhere near 50% APY


[09/05/2020 9:34 PM] Anthony#9994
ok so thats weird - I wonder why you're getting a higher return on less ETH


[09/05/2020 9:35 PM] WhatNot23#1648
i think u may be missing a decimial


[09/05/2020 9:35 PM] WhatNot23#1648
Seems like you should be closer t o$70


[09/05/2020 9:37 PM] Anthony#9994
0.0443 ETH yield in 5 days off 40 ETH - does that sound right to you?


[09/05/2020 9:38 PM] Anthony#9994
thats off a screenshot i took of the Vault with my eth, compared to one I just did now


[09/05/2020 9:42 PM] WhatNot23#1648
Nope. That's approx $15 though


[09/05/2020 9:48 PM] Anthony#9994
soooo...should i just withdraw my ETH? I dont know what else to do...i thought waiting, it might drop it all in at once, but after seeing the small amount drop in today.. its hardly worth the risk of having that much eth in the vault for even $15 over 5 days


[09/05/2020 10:25 PM] ONI#6888

That yeild is correct. All I know is that yesterday when the ratio went from 200 to 320 the yeild on the vault dropped from look at the stats publicly available.


[09/06/2020 1:52 AM] ONI#6888
So yesterday the yield wasn't high. I didn't say the whole time of the vaults life the yeild was low.

@Unknown there are no real interest payouts, rather the price of your yTokens increase over time, as the strategy iterates it increases the price so not at a given interval but depending on the strategy. the yUSD for example is almost continuosly increasing in value

> How do I check the rewards balance on my eth sitting in yearn eth vault?
@cbcrypto One way is to go to https://yearn.finance/vaults and expand the ETH vault, it's the difference between your initial deposit and the current holdings. Example I deposit 10 ETH and it now shows 9.9875 yETH (10.0472 ETH) after some time.

@ONI Yeah I don't normally use Binance but it's the only exchange that I have an account where I could buy YFI. When they switched over to a US site the only diff between the old and the new is a .us after Binance which I overlooked.


[09/06/2020 9:41 AM] ONI#6888
you can buy it with eth on uniswap tho


[09/06/2020 12:21 PM] yowassup#0972
> Can we make a proposal to get YFI listed on Coinbase? lol I accidentally bought my YFI with my old Binance account (not the US version) and now I can't move my tokens to a wallet. Only to another exchange apparently.
@🤮🤯🤔🙂  really? That’s strange


[09/06/2020 12:33 PM] slim#3953
Hi. I have some YFI staked in the vault but I see 0 staked when looking at the "Yield Farming Info" site. Should I be concerned about this?


[09/06/2020 12:40 PM] slim#3953
Okay I think i just figured out the vault and the governance staking are 2 completely different things and that i should be performing the governance staking to earn rewards. Is this correct?

Hi,

i am trying to connect my wallet with Ledger

i have multiple adresses, where my ETH and ERC20 tokens are stored.

it seems, yearn.finance take the first adress, that it can find. How do i choose or change to the right one?

@Unknown 

I think this is spam due to not having a filter of sorts that determines what people are allowed to propose


[09/06/2020 3:37 PM] Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com#4160
/ which people are allowed to make proposals


[09/06/2020 3:38 PM] Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com#4160
I don't necessarily think we should fix this as I consider it a small price to pay in exchange for truly open ended community-driven governance


[09/06/2020 3:38 PM] Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com#4160
However, I could see it becoming overwhelming if it increases which would be detrimental to the project and would make a solution necessary


[09/06/2020 3:39 PM] Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com#4160
So hopefully we can moderate ourselves so this isnt necessary

[09/06/2020 4:01 PM] Ysopaica#4784
Hello, I thought Yearn.finance was about easy optimisation of the yield by choosing automatically the best platform. I wanted to try but then I saw many different vaults with different yield performance. Should I go in « earn » ? Thanks !


[09/06/2020 4:11 PM] Matterhorn#1591
If you have stablecoins that you want to get a yield on, then Earn is the best option. If you have different crypto assets, then you can use vaults.


[09/06/2020 4:12 PM] Matterhorn#1591
like if you want more ETH, you would use yETH and lock your ETH in a vault


[09/06/2020 4:12 PM] Ysopaica#4784
But if I want to optimize the yield in general, whatever stablecoin I have ?


[09/06/2020 4:12 PM] Ysopaica#4784
I then need to check the different vault performance every day ?


[09/06/2020 4:14 PM] Ysopaica#4784
Thanks anyway for your help


[09/06/2020 4:15 PM] Matterhorn#1591
so i don't think the platform swaps your stablecoins to other stablecoins depending on the yield.. like, it won't trade your DAI for USDT b/c USDT is earning a higher yield. If you deposit DAI, your DAI will automatically find the best yield for DAI (switching between AAVE, dydx, compound, fulcrum, etc.)


[09/06/2020 4:15 PM] Ysopaica#4784
Ok get it


[09/06/2020 4:15 PM] Ysopaica#4784
Could be great to automatically swap no ?


[09/06/2020 4:16 PM] Matterhorn#1591
i don't think so, personally I would not want to touch USDT


[09/06/2020 4:16 PM] Ysopaica#4784
DAI is the safest for you ?


[09/06/2020 4:17 PM] Matterhorn#1591
It may make sense for some coins, but it also adds trading fees on top which cost gas and can lower overall return


[09/06/2020 4:17 PM] Ysopaica#4784
USDT not backed as they claim it ?


[09/06/2020 4:17 PM] Matterhorn#1591
I think DAI and USDC are my favorites


[09/06/2020 4:17 PM] Matterhorn#1591

Problems with the dashboard page on yinsure.finance.  I am using metamask with brave browser. Works fine for wallet addresses I connect where I did not purchase cover. However, I purchased cover with one of my wallet addresses, and when I try to load the yinsure.finance dashboard it briefly flashes onto the page and then goes blank.

when depositing into the yCRV vault one gets yUSD in return (aka yyCRV). What is a good way to utilize yUSD while still earning in the vault ? 

I see Cream.finance allows to to supply yUSD, so that one can use that as collateral. 
Is there any other platform where one can put yUSD into use ?

@bit  multiple times a day when someone calls the function for the contract

how often does the vault give out the yield ? i deposited some fund into the vault yesterday, but still have not seen any YFI in my balance ...


[09/07/2020 2:04 AM] AlanDooz#1614
What's the difference betweeh:

EARN
y.curve.fi
DAI
6.5567% Interest Rate

And

VAULTS
DAI
79.41% This vault is earning

???

@Unknown earn basically just looks for the best place to lend your tokens and earn interests, vaults use pretty advanced strategies


[09/07/2020 2:10 AM] AlanDooz#1614
Thank you @Unknown ! Is a major risk on putting DAI on vaults then? Do I need to do something else apart from lend my DAIs with vault?

> Thank you @Unknown ! Is a major risk on putting DAI on vaults then? Do I need to do something else apart from lend my DAIs with vault?
@Unknown definitely not 'major', risk is inherent in crypto but i'd consider the vaults among the lowest risk investment products on the market. and no you'd just deposit dai, and in turn would receive yDai which will go up in price (use zapper.fi to check) and when you wanna withdraw just go with your yDai back to the site and withdraw. remember though there is a 0.5% withdrawal fee

So, is clearly better to deposit on the vault than just on earn, right? haha. Great, thanks really for the understandable and clearly explanation! Do you home some links to where earn those things easily? (Thanks for the fee info and all)

@Unknown  it does it at various times in the day. If you deposited YFI into the YFI vault however you won’t see it increase because at present that vault is not farming anything. A strategy will be reinstated at some point to get it going again but there is no ETA on that.

@Unknown that's the overall yield on the pool not on your eth


[09/07/2020 7:44 AM] Bits&Tea#4039
@Unknown thanks for the response. So if lets say I put in 100 ETH and the "earnings" are a stable 40% does that give me 40% at the end of the year? Or is there a way for me to calculate how much I'm supposed to get for investing

@Unknown 
It doesn't have a pegged % if the pool is not doing well you get less or loose your fund

@bit  have a look at the transaction where you staked and see how much <Curve.fi renBTC/wBTC/sBTC> you sent to the vault. Now open the vaults page and see how much is in the (brackets). It should be higher! That’s because the value of the btc has gone up relative to the amount of yTOKENs you bought.

I now see that I still have the $aLink token in my metamask (and it is showing up on the YFI yaLink dashboard). Can I now stake the $aLink in the yaLink vault?

@Unknown If you do that, you will get liquidated.
The aToken represents your collateral on Aave, if you move it, your positions most likely will become undercollateralized.


[09/07/2020 4:33 PM] Deepcryptodive | GoodGhosting#1337
And someone can liquidate you


[09/07/2020 4:33 PM] Deepcryptodive | GoodGhosting#1337
If you pay back your USDC first (so you do not have any outstanding debt on Aave), then yes, you can deposit your aLINK to the aLINK vault

You can check how much yield your vault accounts are making at Zapper.fi. A note that the amount of vault tokens you have will not increase unless you deposit more of that vaults coin into the vault, but the price of the vault tokens you hold, yusd for example will increase daily. That is your yield. Check the usd balance of your vault accounts on zapper, and it will increase over time.

If I have claimable gov rewards and I unstake, do those remain for me to claim later?

Rookie question here. I know YFI vault, but what is YFI earn?


[09/08/2020 1:56 AM] Dr Disben#4424
Lower risk, lower return


[09/08/2020 1:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
What are the risks for depositing DAI in YFI vault?


[09/08/2020 2:07 AM] Matterhorn#1591
If you have dai you would deposit it via Earn, you are risking that whatever protocol is giving the highest yield doesn’t have any smart contract bugs including earn itself


[09/08/2020 2:08 AM] Matterhorn#1591
How much CRV does YFI hold and how much is staked as vecrv? Would someone explain the boost strategy to me and how it works?


[09/08/2020 2:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
I see that we can deposit DAI via vault as well?


[09/08/2020 2:16 AM] Dr Disben#4424
MM says it's going to be .9eth to withdraw from ygov? But I haven't voted recently


[09/08/2020 2:17 AM] Dr Disben#4424
Nm, it hadn't updated. 👍


[09/08/2020 2:35 AM] ONI#6888
@Dr Disben yes they do


[09/08/2020 2:35 AM] ONI#6888
but you have to claim them within 3 days of voting

@Unknown faq.yearn.finance


[09/08/2020 2:36 AM] ONI#6888
also you cannot deposit dai in the yfi vault, only yfi. Also the yfi vault is paused for now so if you have yfi just stake it for yield


[09/08/2020 2:36 AM] ONI#6888
@Unknown not sure how much vecrv, but all vaults farming crv will get boosted soon to 2x or more


[09/08/2020 2:37 AM] ONI#6888
probably within the day


[09/08/2020 2:39 AM] Dr Disben#4424
Is there a 1-step usdt to yvault? The zap page is missing a button to click, and Zapper.fi only wants DAI or USDC


[09/08/2020 2:45 AM] dripdrop#3124
Re gov - Any pro tips on claim management? 
- If there is nothing to vote on how can I claim? Can’t? 
- I’ve voted in the past. Do I need to Register each time? 
- Can I unstake 99% of my YFI then vote with a 1% amount to claim? And then restake the 99% and keep earning (but the 99% isn’t locked so it’s liquid?)?  Or if I restake that is auto locked during the 3 day period? 
- After I vote once, I can claim instantly anytime after the 3 days. Even 1 year later? Is it 1 vote for 1 claim? Or 1 vote claim as many times as you want forever? 
- I have an old wallet with a tiny amount (<$60) left to claim. Any tips? Can I leave a near gas zero transaction pending for a few days? 

Thanks!

[09/08/2020 3:11 AM] ONI#6888
"The vault successfully managed a ~36% decline in the price of ETH without any adverse effects to user funds. The vault is currently in the process of being unwound (DAI paid off) in order to implement new improvements and optimizations, not because of excessive risk. A new v2 yETH strategy will launch once this process is complete."

@Unknown thanks, and what if I don't claim rewards after a vote? Do my rewards get redistributed among other voters, or will I be able to claim them after future votes?


[09/08/2020 4:37 AM] Jeyrantur#2925
hi! two questions: 1.are the transaction fees paid in only ETH? 2.Is there a dumb version of the strategies of the vaults for me to read and understand the risks?

@Unknown no your rewards are forever yours, and you can claim them anytime you vote up to 3 days after

Hi, I deposited ETH on the yETH vault and then withdrew the yETH. Am I still getting the yield of that vault?


[09/08/2020 6:27 AM] nicodemos#3156
> You can check how much yield your vault accounts are making at Zapper.fi. A note that the amount of vault tokens you have will not increase unless you deposit more of that vaults coin into the vault, but the price of the vault tokens you hold, yusd for example will increase daily.

@ONI i assume this is the answer to my question


[09/08/2020 6:27 AM] ONI#6888
if you withdrew from the vault you do not get the yield from the vault anymore, you should have just eth in your account


[09/08/2020 6:28 AM] ONI#6888
do you mean withdrew yeth to eth or weth, or sent your yeth to another account?


[09/08/2020 6:31 AM] nicodemos#3156
i sent my yeth to cream


[09/08/2020 6:34 AM] ONI#6888

Could someone please be so kind to explain to me, by holding yfi tokens, what do you actually get, aside from governance power?
Do you get any share of the profit or fees or aynthing? Anything form holding?
If not now maybe in the future?

Ive been using the project and like it,and would like to own coins,  but I fail to find value in the token aside form governance?


[09/08/2020 1:30 PM] waif#7542
for one you get a weekly yield farming rate for staking your yfi. the current yields are specified here: https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/ygov2/

[09/08/2020 1:34 PM] waif#7542
second, in the future, there is discussion of a fee portion of the vault profits (from people staking their money in yETH, yCrv, yDAI, etc.) going to staked holders of the governance token, which seems to have community support, although that has not been passed. if that does pass, then YFI holders would get that as well. And we're still very early in the process. The YFI holding community can decide what it wants to do to maximize its potential.

[09/08/2020 1:41 PM] B.B.#3466
So basically if you hodl yfi, now, it giver you a right to a percantage of fees collected by the protocol.

All you need to do is stake it? 
When you stake yfi, the yield comes from the fee, from the protocol?


[09/08/2020 1:45 PM] B.B.#3466
But in what coin are those yfi staking rewards?


[09/08/2020 1:45 PM] waif#7542
Right now you need to stake it to get entitled to at least the yCRV moneys from farming, and most likely any future protocol fee benefits. You need to vote on yearn proposals before you can claim rewards from that staking (currently there are no active proposals being voted upon and I haven't gone through the rewards claim process yet, but I'm staked).

Hi. I am new to using yearn vaults. After depositing DAI, my yDAI balance is about 7% less than the amount of DAI that I deposited. Why?


[09/08/2020 4:34 PM] eris#1913
maybe you can't deposit because of the migration

@Unknown the eth vault isn’t open to deposits


[09/08/2020 5:34 PM] yao#7227
@Unknown yDAI isn’t 1:1 with dai - it’s an asset which is always increasing in value. This means if you withdraw your DAI then you’ll get more than what you put in

How do I go about earning `YFI` with my `yUSDC`? I'm trying to stake my `yUSDC` but  I'm unsure of how to interact with them (i.e. how do I get them into my wallet). I only made a `USDC` deposit today if that matters.

Have placed some link there quite early on.
Currently it takes over $55 to withdraw at 70gwei gas prices.
Is this normal?

[09/09/2020 3:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
@blockomoco @1saac yes what's shown on yearn is taking the performance since inception and extrapolating it for one year which imo is the fairest way to display this data.


[09/09/2020 3:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
on py-earn the approach is the same but with different timeframes

however py-earn isnt updated, i'll do that right away (oh also it doesnt have the eth vault, dunno when i'm gonna get to that)


[09/09/2020 3:11 AM] blockomoco#9490
as a user, Im most interested to see what is the yield Im earning "right now". Or for a short time horizon like, 1 week or so. Seeing the historic yield across inception is not very useful to me since I dont get that yield


[09/09/2020 3:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
so if you'd look on py-earn for example at the yearly forecast from the historic daily snapshot, what it does is take the data from yesterday and extrapolates it over a year, which won't mean that this is the correct ROI for the year but it might be helping as indicator. numba up -> better numba down <- not better


[09/09/2020 3:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
@blockomoco  no then i didnt express myself correctly if you go to py-earn and look at the forecast daily, from the historic daily it's pretty accurate and is forecasting what you'll get in the upcoming 24 hours

it's just that there's no way to look in the future so you have to take some data to predict future returns, and the only data there is is the performance in the past. which for short term is a  useful approximation

[09/09/2020 4:13 AM] yao#7227
@1saac I think the yalink vault harvests less frequently and so updates less often - give it a few days. If you look at https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/yvault/ you can see the 1 day APY is nearly zero so it means you haven’t done anything wrong - the value just hasn’t gone up recently. When they harvest rewards into it or change the strategy to something better, it will

@1saac the current market is affecting aLink vault quite a bit, the price dropped from 16$ to 11$, this means that more collateral has to be given and in turn less is available for the strategy to make earnings. Once the market recovers it's going to normalize.

[09/09/2020 11:45 AM] Vsear#6984
When you first deposit aTokens they put a small portion of the deposit into a tenporary insurance buffer in case shtf. That will be given back to you once the interest you've earned is greater than it. The withdrawal fee is applied when you withdraw. You should probably jot withdraw before you get back that insurance cost

It's normal that number of ycrvbtc remains the same in the vaults? As I understand it depict your share in the vault. While the number in the bracket (crvBTC) it's the actual quantity of tokens you'll get?

@Unknown exactly, that is how it works


[09/09/2020 7:14 PM] trader8899#5242
Hey, is there a safe gas limit to use? I just tried depositing DAI with metamask to the DAI vault, set GWEI at 93 and 50K gas and the transaction failed.

@Unknown Are you using metamask? Let it estimate the gas


[09/09/2020 7:15 PM] trader8899#5242
Yeah I am using metamask


[09/09/2020 7:15 PM] saltyfacu#1111
DM me the tx id


[09/09/2020 7:15 PM] trader8899#5242
Ah right, it set the limit at like 600K ($26 USD!)


[09/09/2020 7:15 PM] saltyfacu#1111
Give me a min

@Unknown which dai vault?


[09/09/2020 7:16 PM] saltyfacu#1111
Can you send me a screenshot?


[09/09/2020 7:16 PM] trader8899#5242
Just the main DAI vault

[09/09/2020 7:18 PM] saltyfacu#1111
> Just the main DAI vault
@Unknown It's disabled, are you using the UI?


[09/09/2020 7:19 PM] trader8899#5242
It's not showing as disabled for me, just going off the main landing page


[09/09/2020 7:19 PM] trader8899#5242
But if the DAI vault is disabled I guess maybe that's why the transaction failed?


[09/09/2020 7:20 PM] saltyfacu#1111
Sorry my bad


[09/09/2020 7:20 PM] saltyfacu#1111
Wait a sec

Thanks!


[09/09/2020 7:28 PM] saltyfacu#1111
@Unknown look, you gotta let Metamask estimate your gas. If not you will be spending gas and the transaction will not be confirmed. Check eth gas station for gas price but lowering the amount of gas will cost you


[09/09/2020 7:29 PM] trader8899#5242
Ah right, was trying to save some pennies! So short answer is there's no safe gas limit for DAI vault transactions except for what metamask recommends?


[09/09/2020 7:30 PM] lost#7719
whats ytrade.finance and what does it do exactly


[09/09/2020 7:30 PM] saltyfacu#1111
@Unknown yes, it will cost you more because you will be wasting gas. You can tweak the price, but always check eth gas station. Your transaction might get stuck


[09/09/2020 7:31 PM] trader8899#5242

[09/09/2020 7:55 PM] lost#7719
hows that possible


[09/09/2020 7:55 PM] lost#7719
as its not over collateralized

@saltyfacu but how can it be an undercollateralized loan?


[09/09/2020 7:58 PM] saltyfacu#1111
It's a leveraged position, so you deposit Y and you can retire Yx1000 for example


[09/09/2020 7:58 PM] lost#7719
so you cannot take it out of the system?


[09/09/2020 8:10 PM] saltyfacu#1111

@saltyfacu but you can't LOSE your deposit right?


[09/09/2020 9:37 PM] saltyfacu#1111
The latter lends in the procotol with the best APY, but the Vaults execute more complex strats

In one, you use Aave, Compound or dy/dx. Now check the Vault, it's a complex system, and smart contracts can fail. And not all of them are ours. Andre and all the team put all the effort to avoid this, but we are not perfect

Hey guys, can I just confirm,  you don't need to burn your YFI to earn fees? Instead the fees are distributed by staking and you can claim them? Is that right? I can only see a brief discussion about the proposal that was voted against (I think).


[09/10/2020 7:41 AM] siipiorava#0056
YFI is no longer burned, you stake it in governance, and you have to vote on governance proposals to be able to withdraw governance rewards

@Unknown check gas price in `edit --> advanced` please. How much does it say?


[09/10/2020 9:59 AM] Doko#3467
gwei = 132, gas limit = 11805455

Ok, that's fine. Gas is not cheap today


[09/10/2020 10:03 AM] Doko#3467
looks huge cost to stake aLink into vault...


[09/10/2020 10:03 AM] Doko#3467
or I miss something here ?


[09/10/2020 10:05 AM] zai#0518
that means you have a loan outstanding against your link


[09/10/2020 10:05 AM] zai#0518
and it's an invalid transaction


[09/10/2020 10:06 AM] Doko#3467
right, indeed I borrowed against link in aave, so it means I can't stake aLink into yfi ?


[09/10/2020 10:08 AM] zai#0518
no, because that means you will no longer have the collateral, which is backing your borrowing


[09/10/2020 10:09 AM] zai#0518
that is not allowed


[09/10/2020 10:09 AM] zai#0518
you can stake the free amount, which you should be able to see as available borrowing capacity in your aave dashboard

hi there, i was experimenting this past week with yield farming aylink which is earning over 40%. today i went in to withdraw 100% to see if i was earning link. i was. i earned like 18 link, so i re-deposited it all and then somehow lost 60 link in the process. can someone tell me what happened?


[09/10/2020 11:13 AM] zai#0518
it takes an insurance deposit upfront, which it returns when you withdraw.


[09/10/2020 11:14 AM] pawled#6170
you mean when i withdraw from the yearn vault or when i withdraw from aave? i did the former and now have 60 less than when i started sitting in aave


[09/10/2020 11:15 AM] zai#0518
the vault does this.


[09/10/2020 11:15 AM] pawled#6170
well then i didn't get it back. i earned 40% for 5 days and somehow lost 60 link

[09/10/2020 3:30 PM] tdiggity#9495
@Unknown  Yup just deposit link in  aave and the alink should show up in your wallet, 

I also think you could swap for it on exchanges that carry it and for a third option use the invest tab on zapper.fi,  search for the alink vault in the search bar, and swap using the collaterals there ( haven't used the second two options yet myself full disclosure but I do use zapper.fi to track my investments )


[09/10/2020 3:33 PM] Dionysis#2270
@Unknown Thank you! That was the missing piece for me to experiment with the Yvaults. I'm going to deposit link in Aave now.


[09/10/2020 3:34 PM] Dionysis#2270
Unrelated, but I have another question. I have a grasp on Vault function and risk - but I'm having trouble understanding the inherent risk in step one, exchanging Link for aLink. Is there inherent risk with that single step? Other than Link exposure, which personally I'm fine with


[09/10/2020 3:41 PM] tdiggity#9495
Im not 100% sure on that also experimenting with aave haha so maybe seek help from someone else but as I understand it besides exposure to link there shouldn't be any if you don't use it as collateral for a loan obviously there will be gas costs for unlocking your link to use with aave and depositing it in the vault but outside those or a full collapse of aave/ecosystem as a whole that's what I see so far as the risks involved


[09/10/2020 3:42 PM] Dionysis#2270
Okay, that's nice to hear. I understand it that way, too. But the returns on the Vault and how this all works seemed... Honestly not feasible without assuming more risk than - this could collapse entirely - though an entirely real possibility.

@Unknown Your DAI balance in parenthesis next to yDAI balance has changed. This is the value of the vault. Though I agree it is odd that Dashboard shows projected growth, nowhere does it seem to report actual growth.

Do you have to prove ownership of YFI to get into the @yearnfinance telegram?


[09/10/2020 6:33 PM] Minter#9689
Hi all, can someone assist with this? Im trying to stake on ygov.finance but i keep getting this error the past week.

Hi guys, I lended my yyCRV yesterday on Cream but it looked like that emptied my yCRV vault on yearn.finance


[09/11/2020 1:50 AM] siratoin#3297
when I unlended yyCRV my vault was automatically full again


[09/11/2020 1:51 AM] siratoin#3297
is it true I can't use my yyCRV without affecting my earnings in the yCRV pool?


[09/11/2020 3:59 AM] yao#7227
@Unknown when you stake in cream you remove the yyCRV tokens from your wallet and trust them to cream. However you still get the gains from them being “in the yearn vault”. So you’re Gucci


[09/11/2020 4:08 AM] ONI#6888

reposting from general, perhaps better suited here

when you withdraw from the curve vault on yearn, what do you get : yUSD ? the corresponding amount of yCRV ? Looks like the UI says yUSD, however I'm not sure what that is - is it the yDAI+yUSDT+... thing that I need to convert from curve.fi/earn ?
basically what are the steps to wind down from vault to say USDT

There seems to be 1000's of questions around the theme of "i put my funds in a yearn vault , how can i see how much is being earned? " . is there  a clear answer to this question anywhere posted or pinned for all vaults or on the yearn website ?

@Unknown  tx but would it not be best to have a pinned message on this board from admin, mod , developer or on the website?  Clicking on links from random people in discord  may create problems. Or better still be really clear as to when and how you will likely receive a return on your investment before people actually deposit their funds


[09/11/2020 8:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
how much a depositor will receive is variable  is clear, how to add funds is clear  but how does a depositor know what they have earned  is obscure

@Unknown @Unknown  YFI vault is supposed to use its yield to buy more YFI for you. Governance pays in yCRV. 
YFI vault is currently not doing anything - waiting for a new strategy.

[09/11/2020 9:48 PM] TPC#3208
I apologize for this probably basic question. I tried to Google how gas fees are calculated, and all the answers are complicated. Are gas fees proportional to the amount being withdrawn from a vault?

If I have to pay $10 in gas to withdraw x, will I have to pay $100 to withdraw 10x, or is it not proportional like that?


[09/11/2020 9:53 PM] Vsear#6984
No, gas fees depend on the processing load of what you are doing, and how high the demand for gas is. So to withdraw x you will pay the same gas whether x is $1 or $10000, but you will pay more or less depending on how congested the network is.


[09/11/2020 9:53 PM] Vsear#6984
Gas has been expensive lately, it's actually comparatively cheap at this very moment

[09/11/2020 10:37 PM] ONI#6888
You can check how much yield your vault accounts are making at Zapper.fi. A note that the amount of vault tokens you have will not increase unless you deposit more of that vaults coin into the vault, but the price of the vault tokens you hold, yusd for example will increase daily. That is your yield. Check the usd balance of your vault accounts on zapper, and it will increase over time.

Hey, anywhere I can find out more info on why the LINK vault deposits are currently disabled and when they will be accepting deposits again? Same question for the ETH vault

Hi! Is y.curve.fi the same as yUSD?


[09/12/2020 8:27 AM] 0xKira#7027
or is it yCRV?


[09/12/2020 8:28 AM] siipiorava#0056
yCRV


[09/12/2020 8:28 AM] siipiorava#0056
you get yUSD (yyCRV) when you deposit yCRV into the Vaults

@Unknown 
I think zapper has a view. But the yfi vault currently doesn't have an active strategy right now, just so you know. So you aren't earning any more by putting it in there.

[09/12/2020 6:38 PM] ncitron#9412
Can anyone point me to some resources about how to query the amount of DAI you are entitled from the yDAI vault from the smart contract? Looks like the contract only keeps track of your yDAI balance, but not accumulated rewards.


[09/12/2020 6:49 PM] kx9x#3778
Multiply your yDAI by the getPricePerFullShare in the smart contract


[09/12/2020 6:49 PM] kx9x#3778
Or just go to the vaults on yearn.finance and see your max withdraw number


[09/12/2020 6:50 PM] kx9x#3778
Accumulated rewards is the wrong wording. Think of yDAI like a bond or share that increases in price over time relative to DAI


[09/12/2020 6:51 PM] kx9x#3778
And you can trade that yDAI back to DAI at the ratio (price) determined by getPricePerFullShare


[09/12/2020 7:03 PM] ncitron#9412
@kx9x Thanks for clarifying. So if I am understanding correctly. When you mint yDAI, it is created at a ratio of DAI/getPricePerFullShare? And when you withdraw, you receive yDAI * getPricePerFullShare. Meanwhile this getPricePerFullShare value increases according to yield?


[09/12/2020 7:12 PM] kx9x#3778
Yeah basically


[09/12/2020 7:13 PM] kx9x#3778
And then you have to take in account the withdrawal fee


[09/12/2020 7:15 PM] kx9x#3778
I don't have yDAI, but yyCRV (aka yUSD) works the same


[09/12/2020 7:17 PM] kx9x#3778
I deposited yCRV for yUSD and since then the ratio of yUSD/yCRV has gone from 1.07569 to like 1.0936


[09/12/2020 7:17 PM] kx9x#3778
Since like August 29th

I have a deposit in the Vault labeled "curve.fi/sbtc LP", as shown on yearn.finance/vaults.  However, that holding doesn't show up on yearn.finance/dashboard .   Maybe Dashboard doesn't support that Vault?  My deposits in three other vaults show up correctly on Dashboard.

very basic question.. if I have YFI tokens, what exactly happens when you stake them on https://ygov.finance/stake - does staking remove them from your wallet? what exactly does it mean if they are staked? do you get some different token? just trying to understand this part. currently using metamask

@Unknown Yeah they get removed from your wallet and into the gov contract. You earn rewards in the form of ycrv which is another token roughly equal to 1 USD. Rewards depend on how much you stake and how much fees are generated.

> Is staking best thing to do? Currently have some on my MM wallet , what should I do if I don’t plan on selling
@Unknown if you don't plan on selling. Staking gives you a % of the fees the platform generates. (Staking gives you access to voting. You have to vote to claim the fees).
You can also check the yYFI vault.  I think with the returns they market buy YFI. This would increase your YFI. No access to voting thought. Pls correct if I am wrong


[09/13/2020 6:50 AM] crptmppt#0403
HI folks!
I have Staked my funds in the gov contract at  https://ygov.finance/ 
I can see the funds are staked (and no longer in my wallet)
(I waited a day for good measure)
When I go to vote on a Governance proposal (ex: https://snapshot.page/#/yearn/proposal/QmXywy67BG2rMwaMnfWWP5op6MWPdYUU3RPxD38WdxkN57) I can select a vote, but the modal popping up says I have "0" YFI voting power. 
// if I try to cast still, I get a metamask popup to sign, but clicking sign results in a  "Timestamp error"
// (if I simply check on https://ygov.finance/vote for Open proposals, the linked one does NOT appear... but ppl are voting in it as per the thread?)
--
My metamask activity shows Approve>Register>Stake actions
If I go in https://ygov.finance/stake I can see my stake in there, and some rewards, but if I try to collect rewards off it won't let me (presuming because no vote has gone through?) 
-- 
If I try to UNSTAKE my YFI, it goes through normally, back in my wallet. (with the locking mechanism expected to be 3 days after a vote, this seems to hint at no vote of mine having been cast) 

Cheers for anyone pointing me in the right direction how to look at things and/or help untangling the knots!

@Unknown this is correct - except right now the YFI Vault is not doing anything (not investing and therefore not market buying YFI) - so right now it’s better to stake in ygov and gain ~15% apr returns in stablecoin


[09/13/2020 12:27 PM] skyfer#0001

Hi everyone, I'm trying to deposit crvBTC in the sbtc vault, but I'm getting a transaction with a super high gas limit of 11799132, which amounts to almost 1 ETH. Any ideas of what might be going on? Tried reinstalling Metamask and also in a different computer and browser, but same thing.


[09/13/2020 6:19 PM] Tummler#3233
Metamask just estimates the gas limit. Also, the gas limit is not necessarily the amount of gas spent on the transaction. The transaction will use only the necessary amount of gas to complete the transaction, with the difference in gas used and gas limit returned to your account.

If you don't have enough ETH to cover the very high limit proposed by Metamask, check out etherscan to see of you can identify other deposit transactions, and see how much gas was actually used, then adjust your gas limit upwards to provide a margin of safety.


[09/13/2020 6:29 PM] Edu Edu#2891
I actually tried limiting gas to a normal amount, but the transaction got reverted ("Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [Reverted] "). This was during the approval tx.


[09/13/2020 6:31 PM] Tummler#3233
Keep in mind that every failed transaction burns all of the gas up to the gas limit.


[09/13/2020 6:32 PM] Tummler#3233
When interacting with involved contracts, there really isn't such a thing a "normal amount" that can be applied across different contracts.


[09/13/2020 6:33 PM] vany#0365
only thing that is consistant is eth wallet to wallet tx being 21k gas


[09/13/2020 6:34 PM] Tummler#3233
Take solace in the fact that the gas limit has no effect on the amount of gas needed for a successful transaction, but setting a very high gas limit, above what is necessary to complete the transaction, does require an excess amount of ETH in your address while the transaction is pending.

@Unknown by normal amount I meant what I had last used in my last approve tx with this contract + a margin. Also, the failed tx only burned about 1/3 of the gas. Looks like the tx was malformed, I imagine

unless you gave it a wrong recipient address, which is not Cafe's fault


[09/13/2020 10:59 PM] Jdad#9463
Now, I sent in the btc, got the 6 confirmations. Then it just says  "submitting to Ethereum."  that was this morning and nothing shows on etherscan.io for the address


[09/13/2020 11:00 PM] Jdad#9463
The recipient address is my Megamall address, I've added wbtc token. But regardless etherscan.io shows no activity for the address

This is so confusing to use.


[09/14/2020 1:39 PM] kx9x#3778
you approved the spending limit. now you have to deposit. you probably messed up and navigated away before your spending limit tx was finished


[09/14/2020 1:40 PM] kx9x#3778
You have to go back to the vault and actually deposit the DAI now by pressing the deposit button

The spending limit thing is approved.


[09/14/2020 1:40 PM] newuser#2472

costs a good amount of gas to interact with the vaults and right now gas prices are super high


[09/14/2020 1:43 PM] kx9x#3778
because people are going crazy over some new farms


[09/14/2020 1:43 PM] kx9x#3778
so gas price has been pushed high


[09/14/2020 1:44 PM] newuser#2472

I'd wait to be honest, but it really depends on how much you are putting in.


[09/14/2020 1:46 PM] newuser#2472
Why is gas price price so high now.  The approval thing only took like $3


[09/14/2020 1:46 PM] newuser#2472
I am just putting in 100 to test


[09/14/2020 1:46 PM] kx9x#3778
If you are putting in just a couple hundred, then I would wait


[09/14/2020 1:46 PM] kx9x#3778
because it will take so long to recoup the gas price you paid to get in


[09/14/2020 1:46 PM] newuser#2472
I never did this before so just trying it for the first time.


[09/14/2020 1:46 PM] kx9x#3778
approval is really cheap and costs a low amount of gas to actually run it on the blockchain


[09/14/2020 1:46 PM] kx9x#3778
depositing in the vault costs more gas because more computation is happening in the smart contract


[09/14/2020 1:47 PM] newuser#2472
I haven't even done anything.  Already spend $10 on fees


[09/14/2020 1:47 PM] newuser#2472
This is crazy


[09/14/2020 1:47 PM] kx9x#3778
welcome to Web 3.0 😦


[09/14/2020 1:47 PM] newuser#2472
Can you explain what happens after the deposit?


[09/14/2020 1:47 PM] kx9x#3778
#oneday Buterin will fix scaling issues


[09/14/2020 1:47 PM] newuser#2472
Also in the transaction I don't see the any amount of DAI there.


[09/14/2020 1:48 PM] newuser#2472
Is that normal?  I just see 0 ETH.


[09/14/2020 1:49 PM] newuser#2472
So you mentionrd a new farm
  What's the best return right now.  This vault on yearn was the highest I find do far.  Are there other ones out there?


[09/14/2020 1:49 PM] kx9x#3778
I'd try it out myself and help, but I don't got DAI right now


[09/14/2020 1:49 PM] kx9x#3778
No clue. These new farms are probably unaudited and about to rug pull


[09/14/2020 1:50 PM] newuser#2472
It's alright.


[09/14/2020 1:50 PM] kx9x#3778
but that doesn't stop people from going crazy on them


[09/14/2020 1:50 PM] newuser#2472
Pull rug?  Like run away with everyone's money?


[09/14/2020 1:50 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah


[09/14/2020 1:50 PM] kx9x#3778
you can check out #🌾yield-farming-archive  and maybe #🌾alts-n-farming , I think people have mentioned a few


[09/14/2020 1:50 PM] newuser#2472
Can they do that?  I thought the code would stop them?


[09/14/2020 1:50 PM] kx9x#3778
if people don't read the code, then it can be easy to get away with things


[09/14/2020 1:51 PM] newuser#2472
Ic


[09/14/2020 1:51 PM] kx9x#3778
that is why you need people to audit the code


[09/14/2020 1:51 PM] newuser#2472
Is this yearn fiance thing safe?


[09/14/2020 1:51 PM] kx9x#3778
and sometimes people will "fork" other contracts, but change a small little thing and people won't notice


[09/14/2020 1:51 PM] newuser#2472
Do they audit code here?  I am really new to this yield farming thing.


[09/14/2020 1:52 PM] kx9x#3778
yearn still has its risks, but it has been audited with good scores. You can find those on google


[09/14/2020 1:52 PM] newuser#2472
I got attracted to this because of the high rates.  Like 70%


[09/14/2020 1:52 PM] newuser#2472
That is so high.  So I decided to learn this.


[09/14/2020 1:52 PM] kx9x#3778
and it at least has more history and a bigger community and more products than these new places trying to say they have 3300% APY


[09/14/2020 1:52 PM] kx9x#3778
also yearn has been forked and copied like mad


[09/14/2020 1:52 PM] newuser#2472
Wow 3300


[09/14/2020 1:53 PM] kx9x#3778
so it goes to show that people at least love the model


[09/14/2020 1:53 PM] newuser#2472
So the 3300 is unaudited?


[09/14/2020 1:53 PM] newuser#2472
So not very safe?


[09/14/2020 1:53 PM] kx9x#3778
that's a number I pulled out of my ass, but yes, those very high yield, new farms tend to be unaudited, with unverified owners


[09/14/2020 1:54 PM] kx9x#3778
so I tend to stick with more known projects, where the yield is still believable


[09/14/2020 1:54 PM] newuser#2472
What are the actual rates on them?  Do you happen to know?  Just curious


[09/14/2020 1:55 PM] newuser#2472
I am gonna wait a while for the gas prices to go down.  $80 for a transaction is too much for me.

If you have a minute.  I got a couple of other questions.


[09/14/2020 1:58 PM] newuser#2472
Like what happens after my deposits go through?


[09/14/2020 1:59 PM] newuser#2472
Do I get ydai in return?


[09/14/2020 1:59 PM] newuser#2472
What do I do with the ydai?


[09/14/2020 2:00 PM] newuser#2472
Or do I just get to withdraw dai afterwards?

{Reactions}
👍 

[09/14/2020 2:03 PM] kx9x#3778
> Or do I just get to withdraw dai afterwards?
@Unknown yes


[09/14/2020 2:03 PM] kx9x#3778
just a token that represents your share in the yDAI vault, so you can exchange it back for DAI later


[09/14/2020 2:03 PM] kx9x#3778
and the price of yDAI to DAI increases over time


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] newuser#2472
So you do get ydai after depositing daily?


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] kx9x#3778
as the vault profits and reinvests back into the vault, the yDAI token's exchange rate goes up relative to DAI


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] newuser#2472
Ic so 1 ydai becomes more then 1 daily?


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] kx9x#3778
you get yDAI if you deposit and then after that, yDAI's price relative to DAI will increase


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] newuser#2472
Ic


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] sawine#1337
Ah, so your interest is paid by the yDAI token appreciation?


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] kx9x#3778
so you can withdraw more DAI than you put in later


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] kx9x#3778
yes, yDAI is like a stock or bond that increases in price


[09/14/2020 2:04 PM] newuser#2472
So to redeem dai, you need to send ydai back?


[09/14/2020 2:05 PM] kx9x#3778
yDAI is a share of the vault and the vaults underlying DAI supply increases


[09/14/2020 2:05 PM] kx9x#3778
so you share of it increases as well, represented by the yDAI to DAI ratio


[09/14/2020 2:05 PM] kx9x#3778
yes, to redeem DAI, you must exchange yDAI back


[09/14/2020 2:05 PM] newuser#2472
Okay


[09/14/2020 2:05 PM] newuser#2472
On the vault there seem to be these curve vault


[09/14/2020 2:05 PM] sawine#1337
ok tyhanks


[09/14/2020 2:06 PM] newuser#2472
Does that mean you can deposit ydai there and earn double interest?


[09/14/2020 2:06 PM] newuser#2472
Actually that takes ycrv


[09/14/2020 2:06 PM] newuser#2472
So how to get ycrv?


[09/14/2020 2:13 PM] kx9x#3778
you can get yCRV by depositing stable coins on https://www.curve.fi/y


[09/14/2020 2:14 PM] newuser#2472
So YDAI is the same as ycrv?


[09/14/2020 2:14 PM] newuser#2472
Or ydai is considered ycrv?


[09/14/2020 2:14 PM] kx9x#3778
it is not


[09/14/2020 2:15 PM] kx9x#3778
the two vaults use very similar strategies


[09/14/2020 2:15 PM] newuser#2472
So if I deposit dai to curv then I can get ycrv?


[09/14/2020 2:15 PM] newuser#2472
Then I can deposit ycrv back here to yearn to earn more interest?


[09/14/2020 2:17 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, just takes a lot of steps and gas


[09/14/2020 2:26 PM] newuser#2472
What can I do with ydai then?  Just hold it?


[09/14/2020 2:30 PM] newuser#2472
Can you explain how that curve thing works?


[09/14/2020 3:16 PM] Susanna#6028

aLink should be in your wallet after you deposit Link with Aave.

[09/14/2020 3:26 PM] Susanna#6028
There were two steps on Aave - deposit and Submit - I think I should have left it at Deposit. I think I still had it in my wallet at that point. How do I get it back?

it shows cover available but when i try to get a quote it gives me that error

Anyone know how long it takes for aTOKENS to show up in your wallet after depositing on Aave?


[09/14/2020 3:52 PM] Ξth0xfex#3178
should be as soon as the deposit is complete


[09/14/2020 3:53 PM] Ξth0xfex#3178
you may have to add your token address if you dont see it in your wallet


[09/14/2020 3:53 PM] Susanna#6028
Can you think of a reason they wouldn't show up? I can't see mine in my Trust Wallet.


[09/14/2020 3:53 PM] Irate#3002
is the tx actually complete?


[09/14/2020 3:53 PM] Susanna#6028
Yep


[09/14/2020 3:53 PM] Ξth0xfex#3178
so in trust wallet, search the atoken you should have


[09/14/2020 3:54 PM] Ξth0xfex#3178
it may not automatically show it to you

@Unknown actually the yTokens are less in your wallet (bc they represent a share of tokens that is actually more) but if you'd go and withdraw the tokens you deposited it shouldn't be that much less


[09/14/2020 3:58 PM] Susanna#6028
same balance as on Aave, minus gas fee - haven't gotten to ytokens yet, but omw...

newbie question, how long does it take to show what you are earning, once you stake? I staked some DAi coupld of days ago, and its still showing zero in my balance?

> newbie question, how long does it take to show what you are earning, once you stake? I staked some DAi coupld of days ago, and its still showing zero in my balance?
@ceraverus zero? did you deposit in the yDAI vault?


[09/14/2020 7:12 PM] ceraverus#3970
Yes, its saying that I am earning 69.68, but still showing zero balance for my DAI


[09/14/2020 7:12 PM] ceraverus#3970
So just wondering how long it takes to show your earnings.


[09/14/2020 7:30 PM] TheLonelyGhost#4767
@ceraverus when you deposit Dai into yDai vault, you get yDai in return. 

Say you deposit 100, you will get 95 yDai in return. The value of yDai will increase over time. So your 95 yDai is equal to 100 dai at initial deposit. A few hours later it will be worth a bit more 100.10, a week later it will be worth more 110.

If you look under withdrawalthe number in the parenthesis () will slowly increase. Write down the number and look back a day later and you will see it has gone up.

[09/14/2020 7:38 PM] ceraverus#3970
Ahh ok, I do see in increase in the yDai balance, thanks.  🙂  I was expecting an increase in my DAI balance  lol


[09/14/2020 7:41 PM] TheLonelyGhost#4767
Yeah, when you withdraw, you will have more dai minus gas and vault fee.

this is the step. once you connect the wallet this should show up


[09/14/2020 11:08 PM] zai#0518
then you'll have to approve whichever coins you have, i guess usdt, then the final popup will be to shove it into the vault

this is not zap. zap is probably not even officially supported at this time. definitely not for noobs.

@Unknown the recycler i shared was built by banteg - a core dev, and the front end for it by x48, a community dev, it's not actually part of yearn

it's not a priority right now. I assume after stable credit.


[09/14/2020 11:22 PM] zai#0518
i have used it myself and it worked, but i think I heard other people got rekt by slippage, depends on what assets you are trying to zap. it has no warnings or anything if you are making a bad trade

Hi, I have two Ethereum addresses on my Ledger, and when I connect it to yearn.finance, it's automatically the wrong address that sync and appear (even if I delete this account in my Ledger manager). Do you have a solution for that problem ?


[09/15/2020 3:44 AM] ONI#6888
use ledger with metamask

keep checking next few days, there is new capacity opened up daily and if SAFE crashes, maybe people will stop buying it all for farming...

@Unknown sounds like a wallet issue, might help to tell use which wallet you are using


[09/15/2020 4:32 PM] jderen#2510
coinbase wallet


[09/15/2020 4:33 PM] jderen#2510
it is weird because i am able to deposit under the earn tab.


[09/15/2020 4:33 PM] jderen#2510
just not the vault


[09/15/2020 4:33 PM] kx9x#3778
0.007 gas fee to deposit to the vault sounds completely incorrect


[09/15/2020 4:33 PM] kx9x#3778
Because the gas cost is high for depositing to the vault


[09/15/2020 4:34 PM] kx9x#3778
though gas price is lower than usual


[09/15/2020 4:34 PM] kx9x#3778
let me do some quick maths


[09/15/2020 4:34 PM] jderen#2510
right, yesterday it was almost .125 eth to deposit in the vault


[09/15/2020 4:35 PM] jderen#2510
but it keeps telling me .007-8

[09/15/2020 4:36 PM] kx9x#3778
> right, yesterday it was almost .125 eth to deposit in the vault
@Unknown should be cheaper right now, but maybe 1/3rd of that since gas was like ~300 gwei yesterday and more like 103 now


[09/15/2020 4:37 PM] jderen#2510
yeah not sure what is up


[09/15/2020 4:37 PM] jderen#2510
maybe it is a wallet issue


[09/15/2020 4:37 PM] kx9x#3778
does the wallet give you a gas limit?

here is a recent deposit into the yDAI vault

0.0236 eth fee


[09/15/2020 4:39 PM] kx9x#3778
but since the names are so confusing, I cannot tell if this is the yDAI vault or yDAI earn haha


[09/15/2020 4:40 PM] jderen#2510
its probably the earn since my earn fee was around 2$


[09/15/2020 4:40 PM] kx9x#3778

[09/15/2020 4:41 PM] kx9x#3778
I believe this one is the vault


[09/15/2020 4:41 PM] kx9x#3778
the first shows as "iearn DAI (yDAI)" and this shows up as "yearn DAI Stablecoin (yDAI)" on etherscan


[09/15/2020 4:42 PM] kx9x#3778
shame that the fees are so high for the vaults. it really prices out people who don't have much to invest


[09/15/2020 4:43 PM] kx9x#3778
and doing things like investing spare change and such


[09/15/2020 4:43 PM] kx9x#3778

[09/15/2020 4:43 PM] jderen#2510

[09/15/2020 4:44 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, wish it were cheaper to play around


[09/15/2020 4:44 PM] jderen#2510
i just tried to do the earn and it sent me the 2$ miner fee and i accepted and then it sent me an addtional for 12$


[09/15/2020 4:44 PM] jderen#2510
whats up with that??


[09/15/2020 4:45 PM] jderen#2510
lost the 2$ cause not trying to put in 12 when im only messing around with about 90 dai


[09/15/2020 4:45 PM] kx9x#3778
the first is a transaction to allow the smartcontract to spend your DAI


[09/15/2020 4:46 PM] kx9x#3778
this should be a one-time cost if you allow the smartcontract to have permission forever (or you can limit how long)


[09/15/2020 4:46 PM] kx9x#3778
then another tx to actually deposit


[09/15/2020 4:46 PM] kx9x#3778
I think the first transaction clearly labels itself as just a permission related tx


[09/15/2020 4:46 PM] kx9x#3778
at least it does when I used metamask


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] jderen#2510
i see


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] jderen#2510
thanks for the info, im new to all this


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] kx9x#3778
no problem


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] kx9x#3778
you will see this pattern often


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] kx9x#3778
first tx to give permissions, second to actually do what you wanted


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] kx9x#3778
you will find this on yearn, uniswap, curve, etc


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] jderen#2510
ok gotcha


[09/15/2020 4:47 PM] kx9x#3778
typically the permission fee is super cheap


[09/15/2020 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
it is just flipping a bit


[09/15/2020 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
doing minimal computation on the eth network


[09/15/2020 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
deposits into vaults will be more expensive because more is happening


[09/15/2020 4:48 PM] jderen#2510
on last question for you. is the gas fee a ration of how much you are trying to deposit? for example, if i want to deposit 10000 dai will that be the same price as trying to deposit 100 dai?


[09/15/2020 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
because when one deposits into the vault, lots of extra work is done internally to balance the vault and move money around


[09/15/2020 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
the amount you deposit will not increase the price, it does not scale


[09/15/2020 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
which is why the vaults are nice


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] jderen#2510
ahhhh


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
because we are all pooling our money together


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] jderen#2510
i see


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
while the vault yield farms


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
the vault deposits DAI into curve to farm CRV


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
and every once in a while it will dump all the CRV for more DAI and reinvest


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] jderen#2510
better get some more dai before i put it in the vault then


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
you can totally do this yourself


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
but the gas costs so much


[09/15/2020 4:49 PM] jderen#2510
i see


[09/15/2020 4:50 PM] kx9x#3778
so the vaults are just giant pots for us to pool together ot save gas money while doing yield farming and compounding our gains


[09/15/2020 4:50 PM] jderen#2510
ok gotcha, that makes sense


[09/15/2020 4:50 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, I wish I put my sBTC into the vault


[09/15/2020 4:50 PM] kx9x#3778
because I put it on curve directly


[09/15/2020 4:51 PM] jderen#2510
do you have any recomendations for where i can buy dai or eth with usd other than coinbase? their fees are fucked


[09/15/2020 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
and now I am farming CRV, but to actually withdraw, sell the CRV on uniswap for more sBTC, and put that into curve again, costs so much gas!!!


[09/15/2020 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
and the vault would do that for me if I just put it there haha


[09/15/2020 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
but I wanted to play with just using curve directly


[09/15/2020 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
I think using coinbase pro would save some fee money, right?


[09/15/2020 4:52 PM] kx9x#3778
at least I think it is cheaper than using just vanilla coinbase


[09/15/2020 4:52 PM] kx9x#3778
and you always have access to pro if you have a coinbase account already


[09/15/2020 4:52 PM] kx9x#3778
other than that, not really sure. coinbase is the only site I have used to onboard my USD


[09/15/2020 4:53 PM] kx9x#3778
You can deposit USD to coinbase with a bank account


[09/15/2020 4:53 PM] kx9x#3778
and then buy DAI on coinbase pro


[09/15/2020 4:53 PM] kx9x#3778
but then you gotta wait like 8 days or something crazy to withdraw


[09/15/2020 4:53 PM] kx9x#3778
it is pretty annoying


[09/15/2020 4:53 PM] kx9x#3778
basically you have to calculate if 8 days of yield is more or less than the fee of paying with a debit card or credit card instead


[09/15/2020 4:54 PM] jderen#2510
ok cool , and sending from coinbase to any wallet will cost a fee right?

[09/15/2020 11:33 PM] Fit Binex#5092
would you mind explaining why the devs couldnt send the amount from the txn to my intended address?


[09/15/2020 11:37 PM] zai#0518
because devs don't have that power. these contracts have no such functionality in them.


[09/15/2020 11:37 PM] zai#0518
this is ethereum


[09/16/2020 12:10 AM] PP#3972
is there any place you can farm with uniswap YFI / ETH lp tokens?

no, useless

is there any place to farm yaLINK   that is not  solarite or pasta?


[09/16/2020 12:17 AM] zai#0518
i want to say cream. but if you are sentimental about them, deposit in our yearn vault and get more link. when the strategy is churning again, the APY could be quite high


[09/16/2020 12:18 AM] zai#0518
and it's comfy in there :peepocozy:


[09/16/2020 12:24 AM] PP#3972

[09/16/2020 1:12 AM] HodlDwon#5411
So I got yUSD (yyCRV) via Zapper.fi while preparing for the YAM V3 launch and now since ETH/YFI dipped I want to buy some. What is the cleanest way to exit yUSD?

There's basically $0 of liquidity of yUSD on Uniswap and I wasn't sure if unwrapping incurred a cost (other than gas)?

Hi, Why is earn and  vaults 0% my deposits are gone?


[09/16/2020 3:35 AM] donderper#9738
Lol


[09/16/2020 3:35 AM] donderper#9738
Is there at least a better set of docs someone can point to


[09/16/2020 3:36 AM] donderper#9738
Cause going through the history of this chat everyone is asking pretty much the same questions and getting ambiguous answers at best


[09/16/2020 3:39 AM] donderper#9738
So i sent a small test amount into the DAI vault


[09/16/2020 3:39 AM] donderper#9738
I checked using zapper.fi which someone recommended but didn't see any ydai there yet.  I'm guessing that the contract will take a while to process that and send back the ydai


[09/16/2020 3:39 AM] donderper#9738
Is there some estimate on how long this usually takes?


[09/16/2020 3:43 AM] donderper#9738
Also I've read that you need to participate in votes to actually earn the return. Is that the case with vaults or is that a different product?


[09/16/2020 3:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
@donderper no the yDai should be immediately in your wallet


[09/16/2020 3:51 AM] donderper#9738
Thanks gismar


[09/16/2020 3:51 AM] donderper#9738
So I did something wrong then it would seem


[09/16/2020 3:52 AM] donderper#9738
It's not as simple as sending dai to the eth address?


[09/16/2020 3:59 AM] yao#7227
@donderper you don’t send Dai. You go to the Vaults page and press “Deposit” https://yearn.finance/vaults


[09/16/2020 3:59 AM] donderper#9738
Unfortunately that page is super buggy


[09/16/2020 3:59 AM] donderper#9738
So I logged into authereum on the yearn.finance website and did two deposits from there


[09/16/2020 4:00 AM] donderper#9738
But the amount said 0 eth


[09/16/2020 4:00 AM] donderper#9738
And all that happened was that I lost the transaction fees from my account but no dai was transferred


[09/16/2020 4:01 AM] donderper#9738
So I tried sending directly from authereum to the address listed when clicking on deposit on the yearn site


[09/16/2020 4:01 AM] donderper#9738
But it would seem then that there's some extra code being run on the yearn website?


[09/16/2020 4:15 AM] ApocryphonRa#9535
Hi, I'm having trouble connecting metamask wallet in dashboard. When I click on metamask wallet it just shows a green dot and nothing happens

>So I tried sending directly from authereum to the address listed when clicking on deposit on the yearn site


[09/16/2020 4:26 AM] sadcat#1111
omg never do that


[09/16/2020 4:27 AM] sadcat#1111
the first transaction was an approval transaction that allows the contract to take your dai


[09/16/2020 4:28 AM] sadcat#1111
the page isn't buggy but the interface kind of assumes someone knowing how ethereum works


[09/16/2020 4:29 AM] donderper#9738
Lol, come on


[09/16/2020 4:29 AM] donderper#9738
There's really minimal info on that page


[09/16/2020 4:30 AM] sadcat#1111
yes a better ui would be nice


[09/16/2020 4:30 AM] donderper#9738
I'll send a screenshot


[09/16/2020 4:30 AM] sadcat#1111
not sure when it's coming


[09/16/2020 4:30 AM] donderper#9738
You say it's not buggy


[09/16/2020 4:31 AM] donderper#9738
But simply sending dai using authereum on the yearn website only results in transaction fees being taken from the account


[09/16/2020 4:31 AM] sadcat#1111
no the first transaction was an approve call


[09/16/2020 4:31 AM] sadcat#1111
you have to make a second one to deposit


[09/16/2020 4:32 AM] donderper#9738
Ok


[09/16/2020 4:32 AM] sadcat#1111
it's currently a limitation of how ethreum works


[09/16/2020 4:32 AM] donderper#9738
I get you now


[09/16/2020 4:32 AM] donderper#9738
Is there a time limit within which you have to send the second transaction


[09/16/2020 4:32 AM] sadcat#1111
no


[09/16/2020 4:32 AM] sadcat#1111
just after the approve, it doesn't matter when


[09/16/2020 4:33 AM] donderper#9738
Is there a doc that has this information


[09/16/2020 4:33 AM] sadcat#1111
as I wrote, the current ui kind of assumes someone used to ethereum


[09/16/2020 4:33 AM] donderper#9738
It's not like I'm trying avoid reading. If there's an faq that says: send one transaction then wait then another


[09/16/2020 4:33 AM] donderper#9738
Ok, but how would you define "being used to ethereum"


[09/16/2020 4:34 AM] donderper#9738
What would I read or study to be considered "used to ethereum"


[09/16/2020 4:34 AM] sadcat#1111
so the first transaction shows as "Allow Https://yearn.finance to spend your DAI?" in metamask


[09/16/2020 4:34 AM] donderper#9738
Doesn't happen for authereum


[09/16/2020 4:35 AM] donderper#9738
But maybe you're right. I could be rushing it a bit


[09/16/2020 4:35 AM] sadcat#1111
I'm pretty sure the same thing happened even if thedescription was different


[09/16/2020 4:35 AM] sadcat#1111
so you made one transaction and concluded it didn't work, and later sent dai directly to the contract


[09/16/2020 4:36 AM] sadcat#1111
but which contract? the one for the first transaction?


[09/16/2020 4:36 AM] donderper#9738
Not exactly. I sent a couple of transactions that went through from the yearn website


[09/16/2020 4:36 AM] donderper#9738
But I'm starting to understand it a bit better now


[09/16/2020 4:37 AM] donderper#9738
I'm going to try again later today the way you suggest and see what happens in each stage


[09/16/2020 4:37 AM] donderper#9738
Really appreciate the help thanks


[09/16/2020 4:37 AM] sadcat#1111
does it show as failed?


[09/16/2020 4:37 AM] donderper#9738
No, I had at least two transactions that went through as successes


[09/16/2020 4:37 AM] donderper#9738
But I would have to retry later today to be absolutely sure


[09/16/2020 4:37 AM] sadcat#1111
well I can't tell you anything more without seeing them


[09/16/2020 4:38 AM] donderper#9738

@Unknown I think shorter. Maybe this week. Just going off the vibe I’ve seen from people working on it in here - no evidence to back it up! You can see the vault being wound down so once it is fully wound down then it’ll be back

Figured out my issue. Looks like need to reconnect metamask wallet to Web3 after few hours. Or time out occurs.


[09/16/2020 6:02 AM] Dhrill#2621
my issue is that I don't have enough money to play with this, wanted to pool ~300 DAI, but after paying for "enabling" DAI approval for ZAP I rolled over when I seen over $100 fee for contract interaction, I assume that pulling out from pool requires interaction with the same contract with same fees


[09/16/2020 6:08 AM] Dhrill#2621
Do I need to worry about those spending approvals I gave to few contracts out there
Can I revoke those ?
Can smart contract technically spend my approved tokens without me initiating operation like for example entering pool
Thanks


[09/16/2020 6:55 AM] donderper#9738
the assumption with all this stuff is that your money is basically lost as soon as it goes anywhere near the ecosystem


[09/16/2020 6:55 AM] donderper#9738
so paying fees is just expected


[09/16/2020 6:55 AM] donderper#9738
but that does seem high


[09/16/2020 6:56 AM] donderper#9738
you could do Debit card -> authereum (1.5% fees maybe) then authereum -> yearn dai (probably $5 - $20 in transaction fees)


[09/16/2020 6:56 AM] donderper#9738
i already had dai from a different project but does the above suggestion make any sense?


[09/16/2020 7:11 AM] sadcat#1111
@Dhrill you can revoke approvals, but if the smart contract isn't mutable so it can't do just whatever

@donderper thank you
it appears if I want to "zap" in curve I can do it cheaper via uniswap swap
though I can't compare ycurve token amounts received as Zap interface does not show expected received amount


[09/16/2020 9:34 AM] Dhrill#2621
can someone please confirm if I understood correctly
now I hold yCRV token, which I can zap back to all or some currencies or swap it

does just holding yCRV generates yield, or I have to deposit to curve.fi/y LP vault


[09/16/2020 10:17 AM] morris minor#4459
@Dhrill If you deposit into the curve.fi/y LP vault, you get the better yield of that strategy. You can compare that yield at yieldfarming.info to the yield of just holding yCRV by looking at the daily profit at https://www.curve.fi/iearn/profit

Same question @Unknown. Seeking clarification.


[09/16/2020 11:33 AM] Dhrill#2621
@Unknown I swapped DAI for yCRV via uniswap, not so high fee, and now value shown on various dashboards is more than invested (if I will be able to swap it back via uniswap)
though I am not really sure what am I gaining by holding yCRV.
Vaulting in this case $200 with such high fees is out the question


[09/16/2020 11:36 AM] morris minor#4459
@Unknown feel-the-yearn.app/ seems most reliable to me.

Hi guys, I'm wondering why the DAI vault says it's currently earning 67% (APY, APR?) yet elsewhere such as on https://yieldfarmingtools.com/ or https://stats.finance/yearn it says 36-37%

hello


[09/16/2020 8:29 PM] Icz#9273
i just withdrew my aLINK from the vault after several weeks


[09/16/2020 8:29 PM] Icz#9273
it is exactly the same amount of aLINK i put in


[09/16/2020 8:29 PM] Icz#9273
am i missing something?


[09/16/2020 8:29 PM] sawine#1337
the value of it should be higher than what it was worth


[09/16/2020 8:30 PM] Icz#9273
i thought aLINK was 1:1 with LINK


[09/16/2020 8:31 PM] sawine#1337
I dont think any of the aCoins are;  I think they are meant to increase in value


[09/16/2020 8:32 PM] Icz#9273
as far as I can see I have gained zero


[09/16/2020 8:32 PM] Icz#9273
Have I missed a step?


[09/16/2020 8:33 PM] Icz#9273
I just deposited aLINK into the yearn vault and that was it


[09/16/2020 8:33 PM] sawine#1337
I think there is a 0.5% fee or something


[09/16/2020 8:34 PM] sawine#1337
I dont know how long and how much you left in there...


[09/16/2020 8:34 PM] Icz#9273
over two weeks - more than enough to cover the withdrawal fee as far as I was aware


[09/16/2020 8:35 PM] Icz#9273
and it has returned exactly the same amount i put in


[09/16/2020 8:35 PM] sawine#1337
I see, well idk... i still havent pulled mine out of the vault


[09/16/2020 8:35 PM] Icz#9273

@Unknown it seems that calculation in official site is on all time behavior, those sites offer last day and week results.

@Unknown IIRC, someone said the current strategy for the alink vault is 0 while it's in the process of being updated, so the yield numbers would be out of date.

Does anybody know how to cancel a uniswap transaction thats taking 24+ hours?


[09/16/2020 10:45 PM] jogurt727#0147
I tried a 0 eth tx and lowered the nonce


[09/16/2020 10:46 PM] Irate#3002
you have to do the same nonce actually


[09/16/2020 10:46 PM] jogurt727#0147
That is actually what I did


[09/16/2020 10:46 PM] jogurt727#0147
Same nonce as pending tx


[09/16/2020 10:46 PM] jogurt727#0147
The 0 eth went through but original tx still pending


[09/16/2020 10:47 PM] Irate#3002
what does the status say? Pending?


[09/16/2020 10:47 PM] jogurt727#0147
Yea pending


[09/16/2020 10:47 PM] jogurt727#0147
On Metamask and etherscan


[09/16/2020 10:48 PM] Irate#3002
that normally works for me :thinkingpepe:


[09/16/2020 10:49 PM] jogurt727#0147
What happens after your 0 eth clears? The other tx automatically cancels?


[09/16/2020 10:49 PM] jogurt727#0147
Or do you have to tell it cancel again? Or speed up again?


[09/16/2020 10:50 PM] Irate#3002
the other one cancels, and it doesnt even show anymore on Etherscan


[09/16/2020 10:50 PM] jogurt727#0147
Well shit


[09/16/2020 10:50 PM] Irate#3002
what gas fee did you set


[09/16/2020 10:51 PM] jogurt727#0147
For pending tx it was initially low. Then an hour later I gave it more


[09/16/2020 10:51 PM] jogurt727#0147
Then 30 min later i tried to cancel


[09/16/2020 10:52 PM] Irate#3002
Gas fees have spiked alot in the past 2 hours


[09/16/2020 10:54 PM] jogurt727#0147
So I just hit cancel again, and it pulled an error, but now the tx is showing up as "failed" on metamask


[09/16/2020 10:54 PM] jogurt727#0147
But still pending on etherscan


[09/16/2020 10:55 PM] Irate#3002
the metamask notifications can be off, I always go by Etherscan


[09/16/2020 10:55 PM] Irate#3002
hmmm yeah not sure what it could be


[09/16/2020 10:56 PM] jogurt727#0147
Well thank you anway


[09/16/2020 11:20 PM] skyfer#0001
How many transactions should it take for staking?


[09/17/2020 12:01 AM] southseacompany#8897
> The 0 eth went through but original tx still pending
@Unknown Once one transaction is mined, others with the same nonce will be dropped. Your metamask is borked. Use another browser, install metamask in it, and send another transaction with the same nonce. After that, your original metamask will wake up to the situation. Source: this worked for me.


[09/17/2020 12:02 AM] southseacompany#8897
BTW there is no need to send zero value transactions. You can do another useful transaction, just reuse the nonce and it will cause the previous one to be dropped.

Pending tx disappeared from Metamask but still pending on etherscan.


[09/17/2020 1:39 AM] tradeBro | fornage.eth.link#3090
> Pending tx disappeared from Metamask but still pending on etherscan.
@Unknown reset metamask, and then identify the pending transactions for your address in etherscan, identify the nonce of pending transaction and send a 0 eth from your account to your account with the same nonce, at present moment gas prices have skyrocket due to uniswap distribution of governance tokens so expect 700+ gas price and hope that prices don't continue pumping or wait until the UNI distribution passess.

how to create tx with the same nonce?? i look and dont see any advance options except for gas
@Unknown


[09/17/2020 2:21 AM] jogurt727#0147
Go to settings > advanced> customize transaction nonce


[09/17/2020 2:22 AM] jogurt727#0147
Once you turn that on it will give you the ability to specify nonce before sending a tx

Hi peeps, I'm new to this and trying to work out the mechanics so I just made a couple of deposits to try it out.

just trying to understand where I went wrong:

I've got 2 tx: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb0eff2e686ab03adac95be72fa14d59de15e1c8b8eedd790c720f3e7afcf1b54 and https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb430d1dd7134920eae2a2145123ff77edb4a0e5fe7105bf9ddabd01f8d42fab1

Both reduced the ETH on my wallet but never actually deducted/did anything with the USDC, I still see:

49.29 USDC available to deposit in https://yearn.finance/vaults

What was my mistake, and how can I actually deposit the USDC?

Thanks!

@Unknown it seems for some reason you approved USDC for trade to the vault twice


[09/17/2020 2:52 AM] ONI#6888
you need to send the actual deposit trx


[09/17/2020 2:53 AM] ONI#6888

[09/17/2020 2:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
all good, not in a hurry. Ok, so what might have happened (I read some comments in this chat) is that I navigated away before the tx was confirmed, so probably that's why yearn didn't pick it up?


[09/17/2020 2:53 AM] ONI#6888
so fees are up


[09/17/2020 2:53 AM] ONI#6888
yah


[09/17/2020 2:54 AM] ONI#6888
could be a mistake in the ui and it thought u didnt confirm (usually best to refresh it) and then you sent it again


[09/17/2020 2:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
so if I send another tx (by doing the same actions as before, simply choosing DEPOSIT and allowing in my wallet) then it'll actually process the transaction?


[09/17/2020 2:54 AM] ONI#6888
yes if you go back to the deposit page


[09/17/2020 2:54 AM] ONI#6888
it will just say deposit and should only show one trx (will be the expensive one)


[09/17/2020 2:54 AM] ONI#6888
so you should know its the deposit trx that way


[09/17/2020 2:55 AM] ONI#6888
way more than 10$ to approve


[09/17/2020 2:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
this is what I'm seeing. the wallet app doesn't give me too much info on the tx (other than it being the expensive one), just triple checking that's the correct way to go

using metamask?


[09/17/2020 2:58 AM] ONI#6888
just do 100% deposit all then see how much the trx fee will be


[09/17/2020 2:58 AM] ONI#6888
then reject it


[09/17/2020 2:58 AM] ONI#6888
if its over like 10$ its the deposit trx and not an approve usdc trx

[09/17/2020 3:50 AM] Vittorio#4166
I guess I found my answer :)
the value of yaLINK should keep increasing compared to aLINK, that's how the vaults increase your investment


[09/17/2020 4:09 AM] ONI#6888
yes you can change the wallet address in mm for ledger


[09/17/2020 4:10 AM] ONI#6888
@Vittorio that isnt how it works


[09/17/2020 4:11 AM] ONI#6888
You can check how much yield your vault accounts are making at https://yvault-roi.netlify.app/ or http://zapper.fi/. A note that the amount of vault tokens you have will not increase unless you deposit more of that vaults coin into the vault, but the price of the vault tokens you hold, yusd for example will increase daily. That is your yield. Check the usd balance of your vault accounts on zapper, and it will increase over time. On withdrawal, you burn the ytoken you obtained to get back your deposit + interests earned - 0.5% withdraw fee

I wonder on how can I know whether my fund is growing?
I put my DAI in vault which was converted to yDAI. I didn't understand how can I see the yield, cos there's no growth after a night tho. Is it going to be weekly basis? I found nothing in the docs

@Unknown I cash my donation from uniswap I really don't know from where the money will come to pay for all free distributed tokens. I think the token has some value but uncertainty about selling pressure at the moment I prefer to be safe with yearn.


[09/17/2020 2:25 PM] thiccfarmer#0559
I think its less of a question of where it comes from than a question of will the governance structure be an ongoing narrative. Its hot now but for how much longer. Does governance drive value?


[09/17/2020 4:26 PM] CCIEBRYAN#4476
Using the yvault the number in the bracket does up which is the interest which is fine. when i go to withdraw its only showing me the amount i put in not the amount in the brackets....... hopefully you can understand what im talking about

sorry for the noob question but...i've seen the interest rate on the website, but cant find the info on the timing... is it every days, weekly, yearly? (for stacking)

@Unknown Before each option is presented the new website design allows you to see the returns base on last day, 3 days, week and month. That value is extrapolated to one year APY.

What's the best strategy to use yearn? Spread coins in several vaults and/or earn? Or all in the most profitable? I'm a bit lost here


[09/17/2020 7:14 PM] zai#0518
depends on what you have and what you like


[09/17/2020 7:14 PM] zai#0518
if you don't care go for yCRV

you can stake it and earn fees


[09/17/2020 8:12 PM] sadcat#1111
currently $63 per week but that doesn't mean much, but it can easily grow a lot once vaults get going again

Hi, I have some rewards in the governance pool that I can’t claim unless I’ve voted recently.  I’ve been checking but haven’t seen a voting proposal in weeks. Will there ever be another vote, or are our rewards permanently unclaimable?  

Maybe we should allow people to claim rewards if several weeks have passed with no voting opportunity available?


[09/17/2020 8:51 PM] Vsear#6984
If you want you can unstake and then come back later and the rewards will still be there

hello guys. just have a few questions regarding staking YFI at ygov.finance. i've staked for maybe 2 or more weeks now and never seem to have an opportunity to vote.  For the times I voted via snapshot page, it seems that I'm still unable to claim yfi rewards.  When it says that you must have voted recently to claim rewards, would anyone know if that covers a very specific time range (like claim rewards within a week or two), or will I always be able to claim rewards after being able to vote at least once in the future?


[09/17/2020 9:44 PM] popcornkirby#7582
you can claim within ~3 days after you vote. Yes there hasn't been any proposals recently. There are several active proposals in discussion now

Hi everyone! I got a Ledger Nano X today and I'm a bit stressed as I transfered my yDai from my Metamask address to my Ledger wallet address but can't see them in Ledger Live. I checked my Ledger address in Etherscan and they are there but it's weird as I added the token to Metamask (connected to my Ledger) and it shows a 0 balance. Could you help me out?


[09/18/2020 8:36 PM] Deltarune#0101
On yearn, when I connect with my new Ledger address via Metamask, I can see they are still in the vault, so are my yDai safu?


[09/18/2020 8:39 PM] Deltarune#0101
I didn't withdraw from the vault before transferring between accounts


[09/18/2020 8:43 PM] sadcat#1111
if they are in etherscan they are on your account


[09/18/2020 8:44 PM] sadcat#1111
did you switchto the ledger account in metamask?


[09/18/2020 8:44 PM] sadcat#1111
that's separate from the standard account


[09/18/2020 8:44 PM] sadcat#1111
it it shows 'Account 1' it's not ledger


[09/18/2020 9:34 PM] Deltarune#0101
Yes I switched, I now have my "old" metamask account and the new Ledger one. I transferred other ERC20 token and they all show up, weird


[09/18/2020 9:35 PM] Deltarune#0101
It it ok to transfer yDAI from one address to the other while they are in the vault contract?


[09/18/2020 9:42 PM] bohrTop#4459
yDAI is a token in your wallet


[09/18/2020 9:42 PM] Deltarune#0101
Ok I removed the yDAI token from Metamask and re-added it and it worked!


[09/18/2020 9:43 PM] Deltarune#0101
Must have been a hiccup with Metamask


[09/18/2020 9:43 PM] Deltarune#0101
Thanks for your replies


[09/18/2020 9:44 PM] Deltarune#0101
By the way, using a Ledger Nano with Windows 10 is super annoying, there's a security popup that sometimes prevent me from connecting sending transactions with Metamask, didn't have the issue on my old Macbook


[09/18/2020 9:46 PM] Deltarune#0101
But the most important is that all funds are safu with a hardware wallet now, including the precious YFI

Confused here...  One procedure to get into the y Curve vault is to 1) go to Curve, 2) deposit your stablecoins into the y Curve pool, giving you y Curve, then 3) go to Yearn and deposit your yCurve into the vault.  I think (but not sure) that last step turns it into yyCurve.  Correct?  So can you instead just buy yyCurve directly on a dex and hold it in your wallet, as below?

Hi all, I'm hoping to get some help solving a Trust wallet and yearn interoperability disfunction (tried to send my aLINK to metamask first, but it was going to be $28.40 at 90 gwei, so that's not happening :-P)  - so when I connect my Trust wallet, it connects with no QR scanning, my aLINK shows up on yearn, wallet connecting dot is green, but when I hit deposit, nothing happens, and the wallet on my phone hasn't registered the connection. Hope that all makes sense -thoughts?

@Unknown seems to me like more of a trust wallet issue than a yearn issue.. if you want dm me screencaps showing each step on the yearn site maybe i can spot something

[09/18/2020 11:41 PM] Susanna#6028
Thanks - yeah, that makes sense. Basically, the screen cap would be a green dot and my wallet address up in the right hand corner, but no lead up to that. I hit wallet connect and bam, it's connected. Everything looks like it should. Maybe it's Wallet Connect? That's where it breaks down. Trust wallet is ready to scan the QR code, but it never shows up via Wallet Connect on yearn. It just connects, but then there's no usability... I don't know if that helps?


[09/18/2020 11:42 PM] Susanna#6028

HI Guys, I tried to add some USDC to yearn vaults, It now shows yUSDC in my wallet on ethernscan but It doesnt show that same balance on yearn.finance


[09/19/2020 7:55 PM] orbby12#6419
i think there was a step that was missed to transfer the yUSDC back out?


[09/19/2020 8:11 PM] thrillex#4217
I had yUSD/yyCrv staked in curve.fi/y yCRV vault and approved uniswap to get YAM/yUSD UNI-V2 lp tokens to stake with YAM today. Now most of my yUSD  are gone from yCRV vault and showing negative profit in curve.fi/y profit tab. What happens with my profit earned and was a withdrawal & 0.5% withdrawal fee assessed on my yUSD? I’m quite confused and worried about this.


[09/19/2020 8:15 PM] zai#0518
Your yUSD token is your LP token, or 'receipt' that you deposited yCRV into that vault. As soon as you send the yUSD out of your wallet, the yCRV is no longer yours.


[09/19/2020 8:15 PM] zai#0518
That's how all these staking pools work.


[09/19/2020 8:16 PM] zai#0518
If you retrieve your yUSD and go back to the vault, you will be able to get your yCRV back.


[09/19/2020 8:19 PM] thrillex#4217
So when I unstake from YAM and withdraw liquidity from Uniswap, I should be able to then withdraw my yCRV from the y vault, get my profits earned up to that point before adding liquidity, then pay the withdrawal fee  then?


[09/19/2020 8:23 PM] zai#0518
yes


[09/19/2020 8:24 PM] zai#0518
or you can just sell your yUSD after getting out of yUSD/YAM pool. if the exchange rate is better than gas fees of unstaking

Gas is sadly high atm, and since there are several operations (yCrv is composed of not ony yUSDC but other stablecoins) it is by default gas intensive. If you deposit low amounts you might find it more profitable to swap to yCrv using uniswap and deposit then.


[09/20/2020 6:27 AM] JustEni#6286

this is the correct one to add to uniswap, it should say yDai+yUsdc...
actually you can also directly try and swap into yUSD:

0x5dbcF33D8c2E976c6b560249878e6F1491Bca25c

It seems to have enough liquidity (depending on the amount your swapping it might be profitable)


[09/20/2020 6:34 AM] 0xGavΞ#4654
So I did this a few days ago


[09/20/2020 6:34 AM] 0xGavΞ#4654
I swapped and it automatically appeared in my vault

that's good


[09/20/2020 6:35 AM] 0xGavΞ#4654
Ya needs to be small amount though but handy if you want to add bits to your vault like I wanted to do

whats your gas price and gas limit


[09/20/2020 9:18 PM] newuser#2472
Hi guys I am new here.  Whats 
curve.fi/sbtc LP
can some one explain how that works?


[09/20/2020 9:18 PM] newuser#2472
wow that is some high gas fees


[09/20/2020 9:32 PM] sadcat#1111
you own a stake in the pool comprised of sbtc, wbtc, renbtc


[09/20/2020 9:32 PM] newuser#2472
so is it safe?


[09/20/2020 9:32 PM] newuser#2472
to put in the those curve pool


[09/20/2020 9:33 PM] newuser#2472
how exactly does those curve pool work?


[09/20/2020 9:33 PM] newuser#2472
also if I put btc in those curve pool, would I lose my principle/


[09/20/2020 9:33 PM] newuser#2472
?


[09/20/2020 9:33 PM] sadcat#1111
you can exchange one token for one of the others, there are fees charged during that swap


[09/20/2020 9:34 PM] sadcat#1111
if you provide liquidity you start earning those fees


[09/20/2020 9:34 PM] sadcat#1111
the risk is that one of those tokens loses the peg


[09/20/2020 9:35 PM] sadcat#1111
then everyone would sell it and buy other tokens, leaving liquidity providers with possibly worthless token


[09/20/2020 9:35 PM] newuser#2472
so i have to go to curve.fi first


[09/20/2020 9:35 PM] newuser#2472
to convert?


[09/20/2020 9:35 PM] sadcat#1111
like if renbtc gets hacked (all btc is held by devs)


[09/20/2020 9:35 PM] newuser#2472
ic


[09/20/2020 9:35 PM] newuser#2472
oh so I have to convert btc into wbtc or renbtc?

new to the whole yield farming


[09/20/2020 9:36 PM] zai#0518
did you mine thousands of BTC in 2010 or something?


[09/20/2020 9:36 PM] newuser#2472
no


[09/20/2020 9:36 PM] newuser#2472
if I did


[09/20/2020 9:36 PM] newuser#2472
i wouldn't be here


[09/20/2020 9:36 PM] zai#0518
oh


[09/20/2020 9:37 PM] newuser#2472
I did mine back in 2011 or 2012 though but sold at $15 a piece


[09/20/2020 9:37 PM] zai#0518
:peepokms:


[09/20/2020 9:37 PM] newuser#2472
got a free gpu in 2012.  made $150 profit total.


[09/20/2020 9:37 PM] newuser#2472
yeah thats how i feel


[09/20/2020 9:37 PM] newuser#2472
I am trying to learn yield farming


[09/20/2020 9:37 PM] zai#0518
can i recommend a google search for "BTC on Ethereum"? maybe a YouTube search


[09/20/2020 9:37 PM] newuser#2472
but so much have changed.


[09/20/2020 9:38 PM] zai#0518
youa re kinda starting from afar, and it would be too much for us to type


[09/20/2020 9:38 PM] newuser#2472
i have heard of wbtc like wrapped ethereum like a token.


[09/20/2020 9:38 PM] newuser#2472
but what is ren btc?


[09/20/2020 9:38 PM] newuser#2472
can i not just deposit btc directly?


[09/20/2020 9:38 PM] zai#0518
no. defi and yield farming is an Ethereum phenomenon


[09/20/2020 9:38 PM] zai#0518
you need ERC20 tokens for everything

so it would be good for you to read up on all that shit first


[09/20/2020 9:39 PM] sadcat#1111
but I have to warn you, I consider renbtc very dangerous


[09/20/2020 9:39 PM] sadcat#1111
some devs are just holding $100M+


[09/20/2020 9:39 PM] newuser#2472
why is renbtc very dangerous?  what other alternative are there?  wbtc and what sbtc?


[09/20/2020 9:40 PM] sadcat#1111
the problem with that pool is that it doesn't matter what you originally had, if one token fails you lose


[09/20/2020 9:40 PM] newuser#2472
so instead of renbtc?  can I do wbtc?  would that work?  I think thats an ethereum token right?


[09/20/2020 9:41 PM] sadcat#1111
the pool assumes all tokens have equal value


[09/20/2020 9:41 PM] newuser#2472
so you think wbtc is safer?


[09/20/2020 9:41 PM] sadcat#1111
you own a share in the whole pool, that means you own all three tokens


[09/20/2020 9:41 PM] sadcat#1111
if one token fails the pool is going to be comprised ~100% of that one token


[09/20/2020 9:42 PM] newuser#2472
ic


[09/20/2020 9:42 PM] newuser#2472
what does the term LP means


[09/20/2020 9:42 PM] newuser#2472
and how exactly does that tie into all this?


[09/20/2020 9:42 PM] sadcat#1111
liquidity provider


[09/20/2020 9:43 PM] newuser#2472
so your saying that pool actually owns all 3 types of btc


[09/20/2020 9:43 PM] newuser#2472
renbtc wbtc and sbtc


[09/20/2020 9:43 PM] newuser#2472
so even if I only convert to wbtc, if renbtc fails the pool will lose 30% of its value?


[09/20/2020 9:44 PM] newuser#2472
also at https://www.curve.fi/.  the APY are so low.  But some how on yearn they are much higher.  Why is that?  How does it work exactly?

{Embed}
https://www.curve.fi/
Curve.fi
Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for: extremely efficient stablecoin trading, low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.


[09/20/2020 9:45 PM] sadcat#1111
no it's going to lose ~100%


[09/20/2020 9:45 PM] sadcat#1111
because the pool assumes all tokens have equal value, so if one completely fails, everyone is going to arbitrage and trade worthless tokens in return for those with value


[09/20/2020 9:45 PM] newuser#2472
oh I got you


[09/20/2020 9:46 PM] newuser#2472
what about DAI or TUSD vault


[09/20/2020 9:46 PM] sadcat#1111
it's about that crv apy


[09/20/2020 9:46 PM] sadcat#1111
you get crv token which you can sell


[09/20/2020 9:47 PM] newuser#2472
I am not sure I understand the crv thing


[09/20/2020 9:47 PM] newuser#2472
what is that?


[09/20/2020 9:47 PM] sadcat#1111
it's a governance token


[09/20/2020 9:47 PM] sadcat#1111
you can vote on proposals that change how curve.fi works


[09/20/2020 9:48 PM] newuser#2472
so if you deposit renbtc at curve.fi you will get crvbtc?


[09/20/2020 9:48 PM] newuser#2472
is that how it works?


[09/20/2020 9:48 PM] sadcat#1111
not sure how the lp token is called


[09/20/2020 9:48 PM] newuser#2472
so why is the crv apy different then the apy here at yearn


[09/20/2020 9:49 PM] newuser#2472
like at curve.fi the apy for ren is only 0.96


[09/20/2020 9:49 PM] newuser#2472
and yet at yearn the apy is like 16.13


[09/20/2020 9:49 PM] sadcat#1111
it shows as 27% for me


[09/20/2020 9:50 PM] sadcat#1111
but I don't know if that's even true supposedly it's overestimated


[09/20/2020 9:50 PM] sadcat#1111
after you get lp tokens you have to deposit them into the dao


[09/20/2020 9:50 PM] sadcat#1111
then you start getting crv


[09/20/2020 9:50 PM] sadcat#1111
https://dao.curve.fi/


[09/20/2020 9:50 PM] newuser#2472
wait I am completely lost.


[09/20/2020 9:50 PM] newuser#2472
so I deposit renbtc to curve.fi and get lp tokens?


[09/20/2020 9:51 PM] newuser#2472
don't I just get crvbtc instead?


[09/20/2020 9:51 PM] sadcat#1111
yes (although note that implicitly trades either ~2/3 or 1/2 of renbtc for other pool tokens)


[09/20/2020 9:51 PM] newuser#2472
there is a dao.curve.fi and also a curve.fi


[09/20/2020 9:51 PM] sadcat#1111
that 0.96% apy is income from exchange fees


[09/20/2020 9:51 PM] newuser#2472
are they the same?  or different?


[09/20/2020 9:52 PM] sadcat#1111
if you want to earn crv you have to then deposit the lp token you got into the dao


[09/20/2020 9:52 PM] newuser#2472
so what do you get after depositing at curve.fi


[09/20/2020 9:52 PM] newuser#2472
crv tokens or lp tokens?  i thought you get crv tokens directly?


[09/20/2020 9:52 PM] sadcat#1111
token that represents your share of the pool


[09/20/2020 9:52 PM] sadcat#1111
no you don't get crv


[09/20/2020 9:53 PM] newuser#2472
okay so the steps are deposit ren btc to curve.fi to get LP tokens


[09/20/2020 9:53 PM] newuser#2472
then deposit LP tokens to dao.curve.fi to get crv tokens?


[09/20/2020 9:53 PM] sadcat#1111
yes


[09/20/2020 9:53 PM] newuser#2472
then deposit the crv tokens back to yearn vault?


[09/20/2020 9:53 PM] newuser#2472
is that yet?


[09/20/2020 9:54 PM] sadcat#1111
there's no crv vault


[09/20/2020 9:54 PM] newuser#2472
what about that 
curve.fi/sbtc LP


[09/20/2020 9:54 PM] newuser#2472
its listed under the vault


[09/20/2020 9:54 PM] sadcat#1111
there's ycrv but that's the lp token for the y pool of stablecoins


[09/20/2020 9:55 PM] newuser#2472
I see 
curve.fi/sbtc LP listed as an option under the vault


[09/20/2020 9:55 PM] newuser#2472
its the 6th one from the top


[09/20/2020 9:55 PM] sadcat#1111
I think it just deposits them into the dao


[09/20/2020 9:56 PM] newuser#2472
you mean if I deposit them in to the vault here its as the same as depositing them in to the DAO


[09/20/2020 9:56 PM] sadcat#1111
it should get a higher apy because the vault has locked crv that increases the amount of generated crv


[09/20/2020 9:56 PM] sadcat#1111
it's called boosting


[09/20/2020 9:56 PM] sadcat#1111
the purpose appears to be to artificially decrease token velocity to reduce dumping


[09/20/2020 9:57 PM] newuser#2472
so I can deposit ren btc to the curve.fi and then get crv to deposit back to the vault as yearn finance?


[09/20/2020 9:57 PM] sadcat#1111
alternatively you can view it as benefits for active governance participants


[09/20/2020 9:57 PM] sadcat#1111
yes


[09/20/2020 9:57 PM] newuser#2472
so if I deposit renbtc in to the curve.fi would the principle amount lose value if none of those tokens loses its peg?


[09/20/2020 9:58 PM] sadcat#1111
no


[09/20/2020 9:58 PM] newuser#2472
like for example if I converted 1 btc to 1 ren btc and then deposit in to curve.fi.  Would my 1 renbtc becomes 0.9 renbtc or less/


[09/20/2020 9:58 PM] sadcat#1111
except for the initial exchange fee


[09/20/2020 9:58 PM] newuser#2472
ic


[09/20/2020 9:58 PM] sadcat#1111
if you deposit into the pool with 50% wbtc half is going to be converted to it


[09/20/2020 9:59 PM] newuser#2472
so you mean my renbtc will be converted in to 50% wbtc


[09/20/2020 9:59 PM] sadcat#1111
depends on the pool, that pool has no vault actually


[09/20/2020 9:59 PM] sadcat#1111
only the one with sbtc


[09/20/2020 10:00 PM] newuser#2472
ic


[09/20/2020 10:00 PM] newuser#2472
so once deposited on to curve.fi the crv tokens I get if I deposit them back to the vault on yearn it will earn more crv tokens for me?


[09/20/2020 10:00 PM] newuser#2472
is that how it works?


[09/20/2020 10:00 PM] sadcat#1111
the lp tokens


[09/20/2020 10:00 PM] sadcat#1111
you get back tokens that represent share in the pool


[09/20/2020 10:00 PM] sadcat#1111
crv tokens are separate


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] newuser#2472
but for 
curve.fi/sbtc LP  it said crvbtc


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] sadcat#1111
yes the naming is confusing


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] newuser#2472
like thats the token you have to deposit


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] sadcat#1111
but that's completely separate from crv


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] newuser#2472
yeah these names are really killing me


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] sadcat#1111
that's the name for the lp token of the sbtc/wbtc/renbtc pool


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] newuser#2472
so what do I have to do to get crvbtc?


[09/20/2020 10:01 PM] newuser#2472
deposit at curve.fi?  like deposit renbtc at one of its pools?


[09/20/2020 10:02 PM] sadcat#1111
the pool with sbtc


[09/20/2020 10:02 PM] newuser#2472
why the pool with renbtc won't work?


[09/20/2020 10:02 PM] newuser#2472
there is actually a pool with hbtc


[09/20/2020 10:02 PM] sadcat#1111
it would but there's no vault for it


[09/20/2020 10:03 PM] sadcat#1111
I don't really know if the vault has higher apy than the unboosted dao directly


[09/20/2020 10:03 PM] sadcat#1111
probably has


[09/20/2020 10:03 PM] sadcat#1111
ok I think you have all the information at this point. I have to go


[09/20/2020 10:04 PM] newuser#2472
okay


[09/20/2020 10:04 PM] newuser#2472
thanks for the help


[09/20/2020 10:04 PM] newuser#2472
appreciate it


[09/20/2020 11:10 PM] Monero#1071
there is three different pools if you want to deposit btc

question regarding ytokens--when you add ycrv for example, how is the ratio to yycrv decided?

getPricePerFullShare in the smart contract


[09/21/2020 1:02 AM] kx9x#3778
An increasing number that represents how many yCRV make up one yyCRV

Hi can you advise what yyCurve is, and can i stake it?


[09/21/2020 4:23 AM] 0xGavΞ#4654
> Hi can you advise what yyCurve is, and can i stake it?
@Unknown  $yyCRV is the LP token you receive from staking your $yCRV in the Yearn Vault. Afaik the only things you can do is pool it with other yVault tokens on Snow Swap(curve yVault pool incoming) or use it as supply/collateral on $CREAM to borrow.


[09/21/2020 4:25 AM] 0xGavΞ#4654
If you use it on $CREAM then you get $crYYcrv then you can swap that for $USDC and start all over again 🤣


[09/21/2020 5:07 AM] Cryptochefwannbe#4463

How is the TUSD APY so high?


[09/21/2020 7:47 AM] ONI#6888
Yesterday 10m was allocated to the strategy so I think that has to do with its wild swings in apy


[09/21/2020 8:23 AM] Mélen#4878
And it's been boosted on Curve

@Mélen but reading yesterday it said that the strat was not yielding that as the money sat idol .... a bit confusing also what about the VE tokens in curve does the vaults benefit from that


[09/21/2020 10:14 AM] Mélen#4878
What VE token ?

Governance staking question...   The site https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/ygov2/ gives the current payout in # of ycrv per staked YFI per week.  Right now it's 43.46 ycrv /week/staked YFI.  Is there a site that gives historical values of that number?  Also the historical aggregate ycrv payout per week?  (i.e. not per staked YFI, but total)

Hey everyone,
I've been trying to zap out of y.curve.fi tokens to receive USDT without success (error while executing contract).
I have available y.curve.fi to zap and enough ETH for gas.
Is there anything I should double check prior to Zap?
Thanks in advance.


[09/21/2020 11:02 AM] Harnzer#5542
Hi Guys, anyone know how to unstake / withdraw ETH in the yETH vault?

[09/21/2020 11:08 AM] Pliskin#6197
@sadcat Thanks a lot for your message. 
I wanted to avoid using the withdraw feature from curve and try Zap on yearn instead.
I guess it doesn't work? I'll use curve 🙂


[09/21/2020 11:12 AM] sadcat#1111

Hi friends, I have a newbie qn, so i can only stake YFI in ygov to earn yCRV ? Are there other ways to earn YFI ?


[09/21/2020 2:33 PM] Tritium#0069
@Unknown not at the moment and probably never.  All the 30k YFI available has been minted and mined, and there seems to be a pretty strong intention to never mint more.

@Unknown Yes it just won't be showing on your dashboard


[09/21/2020 3:12 PM] 0xGavΞ#4654
it would still show in Zapper if you use that

@Unknown  I guess you can also stake it in yearn.financa.. yeald is anyway not high..


[09/21/2020 6:31 PM] whyfoo#3310
> Governance staking question...   The site https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/ygov2/ gives the current payout in # of ycrv per staked YFI per week.  Right now it's 43.46 ycrv /week/staked YFI.  Is there a site that gives historical values of that number?  Also the historical aggregate ycrv payout per week?  (i.e. not per staked YFI, but total)
@fessor at the moment I don't think we have a historical performance chart ... I'm sure someone's working on it, so much activity around tooling at the moment

[09/22/2020 5:55 AM] ONI#6888
> You can check how much yield your vault accounts are making at https://yvault-roi.netlify.app/ or http://zapper.fi/. A note that the amount of vault tokens you have will not increase unless you deposit more of that vaults coin into the vault, but the price of the vault tokens you hold, yusd for example will increase daily. That is your yield. Check the usd balance of your vault accounts on zapper, and it will increase over time. On withdrawal, you burn the ytoken you obtained to get back your deposit + interests earned - 0.5% withdraw fee

@ptolemy you didn't pay a fee, it's an insurance deposit and it gets returned.
I forget the exact conditions though, but you get it back.

@zai Question is why we are generating such a low return? Will this be fixed or is this because of market condition ? I am not sure if I should move my fund or wait for market condition to improve ? I dont know the logic used in this vault,  Where can I get the details on logic used for aLink vault ? Is any team working on fixing this ?


[09/23/2020 12:44 PM] zai#0518
it's market conditions, you will never get crazy rates we had this summer again.
these couple of days the rate has been pretty  low, i would wait to see how it develops before withdrawing. vault strategy is shown here:
https://feel-the-yearn.app/vaults
and the docs have a more in-depth explanation how vaults work.

> @ptolemy you didn't pay a fee, it's an insurance deposit and it gets returned.
> I forget the exact conditions though, but you get it back.
@zai yes, he will get it back as long as the vault is solvent and not using the insurance. Else some link will be locked until the vault rebalances, which is nothing to worry about imo because we are almost always not using any sort of insurance, which is great when Link is trending downwards


[09/23/2020 12:47 PM] kx9x#3778
The one time I saw the vault dip into the insurance, I could withdraw 99.99% of my link. People were flipping out because of some FUD on twitter, which was funny


[09/23/2020 12:47 PM] kx9x#3778
and then it shortly rebalanced and everything was good

the ratio to the underlying dollars goes up, so when you withdraw you get more

ah, yes.


[09/23/2020 3:46 PM] brschkv#0447
and YFI tokens are all distributed so you get "only" the plain ROI of the vault now


[09/23/2020 3:46 PM] brschkv#0447
in the form of appreciation to the dollar


[09/23/2020 3:47 PM] brschkv#0447
is that right? 😅


[09/23/2020 4:47 PM] zai#0518
no, YFI is a claim on fees the vaults charge customers


[09/23/2020 5:02 PM] brschkv#0447
But only if they are staked, yes? In which case they also grant voting rights in governance decisions.

no need to bother with curve or swerve for now since the yearn vaults do everything for you. think of holding yUSD (yydai + yusdt + yusdc + ytusd) as better than holding stable coins. it's not the same as yCRV (ydai + yusdt + yusdc + ytusd).


[09/24/2020 3:41 AM] fonso#0343
one unaudited, although so far trustable and competent project you can check out as well is snowswap.org. You can deposit the ycoins you get from locking stable coins in the yearn vaults, into that project. we have a number of posters here who post regularly on snowswap's discord too. they're also mentioned in the yearn newsletter.


[09/24/2020 3:43 AM] fonso#0343
you can deposit ycoins (and even stable coins just very recently) there, provide liquidity, receive some snow tokens (not yet out) that are awarded in terms of time in the vault and deposited amount, and when withdrawing, you can choose to do so via any ycoin or even stable coin. it bypasses the 0.5% fee the yearn vaults impose, although you would have to seriously consider gas costs because depositing or withdrawing from either options can be significantly expensive.

hello, I'm trying to withdraw yDai from the vault. The first activity is to "approve yDai spend limit" - I can see this as a pending activity in Metamask, however there is no corresponding txn hash (related to the approval) when I search the deposited address on Etherscan. Does anyone have any ideas why this txn is not created in Etherscan, but pending in Metamask?


[09/24/2020 5:15 AM] fonso#0343
are you using a hardware wallet with metamask, or just metamask alone?


[09/24/2020 5:18 AM] fonso#0343
quit your browser entirely, open once again, enter metamask, see if a transaction is still pending. if it is, you can try going to settings -> advanced -> reset account to clear the transaction


[09/24/2020 5:19 AM] auz33#6396

You can interact with vault contracts directly from Etherscan from the contract tab if you want. Or any other site that has an interface to Ethereum smart contracts, which is where funds actually are. That's the nice thing about DeFi, a front end can fail and it's all still secured by the blockchain.


[09/24/2020 12:11 PM] Vsear#6984
I think zapper.fi has a friendly UI to withdraw if that's what you want

Question about BTC stored on YFI vault - as it goes through CRV I understand it is worth getting the boost by locking it for 4 years for $veCRV. Yet, with simple calculation of 1 BTC I got two different numbers of CRV to be locked. Which one is correct - the y gauge or sbtc gauge?

@Unknown no, you can't boost this one on your own - it's already boosted. If you wanted to deposit in one of curve's BTC pools yourself and then boost it, you could do that

How often do strategies for vaults get adjusted if the APY drops? For instance, I deposited into the aLINK vault attracted by an APY over 30%. It then quickly dropped to under 1%. I am trying to figure out if I should move those funds or can expect a strategy adjustment relatively soon that helps the APY increase?

[09/25/2020 1:22 AM] arberx#3367
APY is an estimate, based on extrapolated performance from vault inception date. The yield percentage will change daily

@arberx  Error: Returned values aren't valid, did it run Out of Gas? You might also see this error if you are not using the correct ABI for the contract you are retrieving data from, requesting data from a block number that does not exist, or querying a node which is not fully synced.  still didnt get the problem.... maybe theirs a problem with meta mask today?

wrong contract?

the one that distributes to YFI governance staked tokes is the right one

yeah, that looks more like it.
keep in mind there are non-yCRV coins, I'm not sure if that captures everything.

@Unknown did you find a fix to your problem?


[09/25/2020 11:11 AM] m3th0d#0867
@Unknown not yet


[09/25/2020 11:13 AM] m3th0d#0867
@zai can I assume the withdrawal will go through but with an increased transaction cost?


[09/25/2020 12:16 PM] ONI#6888
What wallet?


[09/25/2020 12:57 PM] BT#3500
@Unknown I used Zapper to withdraw from crvBUSD vault instead of yearn (was getting error + >$500 in gas).  I was using Chrome + Metamask. Not sure why yearn front end wasn't working but Zapper was fine

@Unknown what kind of things do you want to work on translations, writing, docs?


[09/25/2020 2:19 PM] vcxv#9199
I have a query- when one stake his LP Tokens in a farm, does it mean he letgo his ownership on those LP tokens? Because the LP tokens or  y tokens move out from ETH wallet, only to come back when we unstake. 
Some one please answer


[09/25/2020 2:19 PM] vcxv#9199
Some one please explain it to me 👆


[09/25/2020 2:25 PM] Mélen#4878
you do but you usually get another token representing the ownership of the LP Token, which represents the ownership of the underlying assets, but it's not always the case, depends on the protocol

{Reactions}
👌 

[09/25/2020 2:29 PM] vcxv#9199
@Mélen  thanks for answering.
Like we get yy token when using vault.


[09/25/2020 2:29 PM] Mélen#4878
and they represent your share in the pool, which you can redeem for yCrv afterwards exactly


[09/25/2020 2:30 PM] vcxv#9199
But when i stakd my LP token in uniswap for UNI..i got nothing. So this is dependent on platform i am using.


[09/25/2020 2:32 PM] Mélen#4878
yes, that's the contre-example i was gonna use


[09/25/2020 2:54 PM] wakwau#7999
@ONI  yes.. all of it.. translation , writings and docs


[09/25/2020 3:03 PM] ONI#6888
in cream it might give you an lp token representing your ownership of the token you let go (I mean it has too), but there if you dont pay your debt you might not get all your tokens back


[09/25/2020 3:03 PM] ONI#6888
or if their system has a glitch/hack


[09/25/2020 3:05 PM] ONI#6888
uniswap gives you a token representing your share of the pool, you just normally dont notice


[09/25/2020 3:06 PM] ONI#6888
@Unknown join translations to help translating to your language, and docs for document writing editing making work

@alphast0rm @banteg @Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com hey guys can someone explain how the vault 0.5% withdrawal fee works? Can depositors avoid these fees say if there are available funds in the contract address and as long as we don't withdraw more than what's available? Or do we still get dinged?


[09/25/2020 5:42 PM] Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com#4160

Unfortunately, some of these links aren't on there, and the others require metamask. I deposited with trust wallet, which doesn't work with these links.


[09/25/2020 10:08 PM] zai#0518
ohhhhhhh


[09/25/2020 10:09 PM] zai#0518
yeah, get rid of that. use metamask. I don't know if anyone is even around to help with trust wallet :monaks:


[09/25/2020 10:31 PM] Susanna#6028
Heh, yeah, I went to support today, and it was a ridiculous labyrinth. I'd love to switch to metamask - so, can I sign in to yearn with it and see my balance even though I deposited with trust wallet?


[09/25/2020 10:55 PM] zai#0518
that depends if you can add the same address to metamask that you manage in trust wallet. you probably can't, so you would transfer your tokens from your current wallet to your new metamask wallet first


[09/25/2020 10:55 PM] zai#0518
it's cheap and easy


[09/25/2020 10:56 PM] zai#0518
and it's good to change wallets anyway, so people don't spy on you too much


[09/25/2020 11:26 PM] Susanna#6028
That makes sense - I've been wanting to do that anyway. Yep, I checked into it - you can't move trust wallet. My aLINK tokens aren't in my trust wallet anymore -  I thought that might be normal, once they were in the vault. Is that not normal? I can't see them on Aave anymore, and I thought it was because they were in the vault...


[09/25/2020 11:28 PM] Susanna#6028
Pretty sure that once I'm using metamask, it's going to be a much smoother ride.


[09/25/2020 11:33 PM] zai#0518
well.... staking or depositing things into vaults often 'hides' it from wallets. there is so much innovation that the various dashboards and management apps are always behind.


[09/25/2020 11:34 PM] zai#0518
so it is normal that you can't see your vaulted LINK in some places


[09/25/2020 11:34 PM] zai#0518
you would have to withdraw it eventually to transfer it to a new wallet


[09/25/2020 11:38 PM] zai#0518
actually, when you deposited alink into the vault, you got yalink as your receipt - this token:
https://etherscan.io/token/0x29e240cfd7946ba20895a7a02edb25c210f9f324
you can transfer this yalink to the new wallet, without having to leave the vault.


[09/26/2020 12:09 AM] Susanna#6028
This is great - I had forgotten about the yaLINK receipt, ha, probably because I'm trying to keep track of a hundred other crypto wonders. Fantastic - so I just need to find my vault transaction on etherscan and enter the contract address into metamask?


[09/26/2020 12:18 AM] zai#0518
no, you need to send yalink from your trust wallet to your metamask wallet


[09/26/2020 12:18 AM] zai#0518
which will make the new metamask address the owner of your alinks in the vault


[09/26/2020 12:21 AM] Susanna#6028
ah ok, got it


[09/26/2020 12:31 AM] Susanna#6028
Almost there...adding a custom token in trust wallet - got everything but the decimals - is that the amount that was transferred?


[09/26/2020 12:31 AM] Susanna#6028
I really appreciate your help, btw.


[09/26/2020 12:38 AM] Susanna#6028

@alphast0rm wondering what's more efficient to get my hands on yusd. to manually deposit into curve then to yearn vault or to simply swap on uniswap...would I lose a lot (value) by taking the easy route...anyone know?


[09/26/2020 3:55 AM] ONI#6888
I think usually uniswap is the most cost effective for a low dollar amount


[09/26/2020 3:55 AM] ONI#6888
but I dont have a calculator for that


[09/26/2020 3:59 AM] bit#6418

[09/26/2020 3:59 AM] bit#6418
@ONI


[09/26/2020 4:04 AM] yao#7227
@bit you could check the cost on Zapper.fi too. There’s no way of being 100% sure you’ll get the best price because uniswap fluctuates. But you can get a good idea of how much you will get ish


[09/26/2020 4:05 AM] yao#7227
Other places to buy - I think SnowSwap let’s you put in stables and get out yUSD. There are links to uniswap pools on their homepage

@Unknown  - not very well - best to stick with metamask on a pc. Even mobile metamask is rough.


[09/26/2020 9:32 AM] ONI#6888
@bit yieldfarming.info will tell you the current price


[09/26/2020 9:33 AM] ONI#6888
then just compare the price uniswap is at for that token


[09/26/2020 9:33 AM] ONI#6888
also have to take into account curve and yearn fees


[09/26/2020 9:33 AM] ONI#6888
as well as uniswap fees

Would someone mind helping me putting funds into the yearn yaLINK vault through Zapper.fi using a ledger? I can't get it to work using a ledger, the transaction won't go through (though it does work with Metamask, I'd rather use a hardware wallet).


[09/26/2020 10:58 AM] zai#0518
you should connect your ledger to metamask. it's really a shithsow going directly. I gave up and use ledger-metamask

> you should connect your ledger to metamask. it's really a shithsow going directly. I gave up and use ledger-metamask
@zai 

Thanks for replying. I've tried that but I'm not sure how to get Zapper to use the ledger account through Metamask. There only seems to be the option to use the default account


[09/26/2020 11:02 AM] Ξkadasha#4149
Like in the top left corn on Zapper.fi when you click the account dropdown, what do I need to click on order to get the ledger account when I'm logged into Metamask?


[09/26/2020 11:04 AM] Ξkadasha#4149
I've tried manage addresses but there's no option to connect to a different address other than the default one.

you go to zapper while connected to the right address in your metamask, and zapper will add it


[09/26/2020 11:23 AM] zai#0518
metamask has to have your hardware wallet added, like in my screenshot


[09/26/2020 11:24 AM] Ξkadasha#4149
I was doing that, I'm logged into account 2 on Metamask which is the hardware wallet. But zapperfi will only let me connect to account 1. I'll try restarting everything and trying again.

3 day is very unreliable


[09/26/2020 8:34 PM] Douglas Reynholm#7354
ok, and the APR has dropped due to the market for the past few weeks, so it should go back up?


[09/26/2020 8:36 PM] zai#0518
ehhhhh. probably not. the main token we are farming and dumping right now, CRV, is only going down, so nothing will improve in the short term.

@aquamarine Use Zapper.fi

@Unknown I would really implore you to use metamask. It offers you a lot more options, with regards to adjusting gas fee and it usually updates token holdings faster than the coinbase wallet. You can import your wallet seed phrase into metamask so no need to do any transfers and waste gas fees.


[09/27/2020 1:51 PM] hombre#5101
How long does it usually take for a deposit to show? I attempted to deposit and had adequate ETH to cover gas costs. I see gas was already removed from my wallet (coinbase) but I do not see my deposit being taken out. Any assistance please?


[09/27/2020 2:02 PM] Irate#3002

asked another way, this is more of a mechanical question- how does the yCRV is ygov increase continuously as part of your stake, when fees aren't generated continuously?


[09/27/2020 5:02 PM] Propagandalf#0496
I have invested into one vault giving me the ycrvBUSD token, and also a few ones on the Earn section. Am I supposed to deposit these Y tokens into the Curve pool in order to stake and receive further rewards, or just leave them there? I read something about getting CRV and/or YFI rewards, but I am getting confused now.

Also, when I wish to cash out my principal and rewards from yearn.finance, do I simply sell my Y tokens via any swap service that supports it?


[09/27/2020 6:05 PM] kiwifelo#8394
Hi there, I'm hoping to get an update on the Link vaults. Is there a way to stay up to date on latest news? I can't find any information. Thanks


[09/27/2020 10:58 PM] 0x0x#6091
Hi All-

1. What material is needed when creating a new vault? Code? Just a written proposal?
2. Where do I post new vault requests/proposals once I finish #1 above?
3. Is there a repository of vaults that I can use as a model? 

Thank You


[09/27/2020 11:40 PM] vapirtraylz#8844
hi so like can someone help me understand why I wouldn't want to just choose the highest % roi vault? like why is there even different options? is that just to say "hey we don't know for sure if that will continue to be the highest roi over time x and so therefore here are the other options as well" ? ....


[09/28/2020 1:30 AM] kx9x#3778
10% roi in Bitcoin is different than 50% roi in dai


[09/28/2020 1:30 AM] kx9x#3778
Depends on what underlying asset you'd like to keep exposure to


[09/28/2020 2:39 AM] manyjeans | deca.art/manyjeans#1280
What do you do with yCRV? I can't seem to swap it for something else on Uniswap


[09/28/2020 2:42 AM] Irate#3002
you should be able to paste the contract address directly into Uniswap, I've done it

[09/28/2020 11:30 AM] southseacompany#8897
@Unknown The earlier transaction (approve) hasn't been mined yet. That's why you see a speed up button. The later transaction will not go through until the first one has completed.


[09/28/2020 11:32 AM] escobar62#6704

Hey all, quick question that I cant seem to find the answer to anywhere. How often do your balances on yearn.finance/dashboard update? Or any of the pages where your balance is shown.
If I have funds in the yCRV vault, is it once a day? Just trying to get an understanding of when I should check back to see if the yields are in fact being reflected on my balances. Thanks!

the problem is that strategies change. don't want something hanging somewhere and getting obsolete.

yUSDC is in your Vault now, it's a vault token by default, so when you got it from cream it would appear in the vault. Ifaik there is not much you can do with it as it's not as versatile as yUSD

@Unknown go to feel-the-yearn and it'll show you. or even the vaults themselves now i guess. difference between vault holdings and strategy holdings > than what you're withdrawing no fee


[09/30/2020 2:41 AM] Weirdbeard#5183
Yeah I'm a little confused... I see the vault has 3,105,354 alink and the holding has 10,296,051 usdc


[09/30/2020 2:42 AM] Weirdbeard#5183
Strategy has 10,296,051 usdc rather...


[09/30/2020 2:43 AM] Weirdbeard#5183
So are you meant to work out the $ value in the alink holdings vs the strategy?


[09/30/2020 2:44 AM] Weirdbeard#5183
That would mean there is 30M in the vault and only 10M in the strategy

@Unknown Yes it does. I have deposited ETH and DAI via Trust wallet. Just now when I go to connect it It doesn't see any funds "Available to deposit? and my dashboard doesn't recognize those tokens are on the platform.


[09/30/2020 4:14 AM] Julius#3098
@Unknown I have had those tokes staked in the vault for about a month. It has only been in the last few days I have been getting the error message.


[09/30/2020 4:17 AM] jmhoy#9160
@Unknown and @Unknown exact same problem with me


[09/30/2020 4:20 AM] artfullyContrived#1065
@Unknown @Unknown Metamask has the option of adding a coin by its contract address. Does trust wallet have an equivalent?

How to claim rewards from ygov.finance
Normally I would agree with Bob, but this is a simple interaction and mostly harmless. I rather you get it from here than from other guide in the internet  First of all, do not trust anyone, do not trust me: Verify.  If you feel uncomfortable with any of the steps stop.  Share...

@Unknown Yes! the DAI and ETH that are staked in the vault don't show up in my total assets in my trust wallet but DO appear in zapper.fi


[09/30/2020 4:32 AM] Julius#3098
@Unknown that site is a great resource. Still not sure how to access those funds on yearn, but great to see they are still there. thanks.


[09/30/2020 4:36 AM] Julius#3098
@Unknown Under Investments it appears that I can withdraw or add to current investments directly from the zapper platform. I'll have to do a little more research into Zapper. thanks again.

Hi guys, 
If Dai deposited in yearn's Earn page are called yDai, what are Dai's in Vaults called?
They're different, but seem to be both labeled yDai...

I've been looking through the docs and can' t seem to find the answer.


[09/30/2020 8:53 AM] g3k0#9198
yeah they are both yDAI but are different, annoying I know


[09/30/2020 8:53 AM] g3k0#9198
Has anyone used Fulcrum and how come they have such crazy high APYs 54% on DAI


[09/30/2020 8:56 AM] ONI#6888
you should ask in their chat


[09/30/2020 8:57 AM] ONI#6888
probably because they have high utilization rates?

head to curve.fi

click on y pool, deposit stable coins


[09/30/2020 4:13 PM] PilotVietnam#9645
that gives you ycrv, then head to yearn.finance


[09/30/2020 4:13 PM] PilotVietnam#9645
click on yvault, deposit ycrv, that gives you yusd


[09/30/2020 4:14 PM] PilotVietnam#9645
then if you have enough capital, head to cream.finance, and supply your yusd there for a few extra %, or you could go the more risky route with something new and deposit yusd in snowswap.org

@Unknown The vault will reinvest the yCRV from gov rewards into YFI


[10/01/2020 9:01 PM] kx9x#3778
otherwise you would have to manually withdraw your rewards, sell the yCRV reward for YFI, and deposit your purchased YFI back into governance

so the vault says you all those gas fees

Yeh its strange, it's driving me a bit bonkers trying to figure it out. Basically I don't see any amounts of stablecoins on the curve.fi withdrawal page. Maybe it's because I have ycrv and didn't deposit stablecoins into y curve.fi directly?

not very impressed with the lack of updates on some of the interfaces tbh. not infrequently some basic functionality like this seems to be glacially slow in getting updated.

When I put YFI on the vault (or any other coin) do I get a full share of rewards the next time it deploys yields?


[10/02/2020 12:43 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
@Unknown When you deposit, you essentially get vault shares.  When the vault increases its tokens balance through the strategy, the share price goes up for everyone.  So  if the vault increases its balance by say 2%, everyones balance is increased by 2%.


[10/02/2020 1:22 PM] Shaft#5423
So there is no "maturation" period, I start receiving the same as everyone else (adjusted for shares as you said) on the next deploy after I've deposited


[10/02/2020 3:09 PM] MirR.#0386
Hi, I have 0.08 ETH on an exchange wallet. I want to transfer to Metamask and it will cost 0.05 ETH. Then I will have 0.03ETH to lock on Yearn.  How to increase the amount with Yearn? Expecting suggestions from experts. Thanks in advance.

When staking for governance, how long after you vote until 'claim rewards' becomes active?

@MirR. Without ETH ... in an Ethereum Wallet ... you are dead in the water. You need to buy ETH somewhere and get it in there... You CANNOT send your DAI anywhere ... you have no GAS !!!

Hi guys - new joiner here taking a closer look into YFI. When I try to connect Trustwallet via the yearn website, besides both Trustwallet and metamask appears a green dot, and nothing happens. Saw a someone on the gov forum having the same issue. They suggested to stop by this support channel. Thanks

what do people use as a cold storage wallet for ydai / yusdc?

Solved the issue - I connected the Trustwallet via „WalletConnect“. Is someone already working on fixing this?


[10/04/2020 1:52 PM] TplusZero#4123
I‘m getting this error message when trying to stake YFI into ygov. Any idea what‘s the issue?  Have the latest iOS, TrustWallet. Connected via WalletConnect.

ygov.finance or some vault or something?


[10/04/2020 3:00 PM] Gimmick#3866
https://stats.finance/yearn is telling me 10% for the YFI vault and it's currently using the YFIGovernance strategy. Does this mean I should use the vault or ygov.finance?


[10/04/2020 3:01 PM] Gimmick#3866
https://yearn.finance/vaults says only 2% on the vault


[10/04/2020 3:05 PM] Neem|eth#0001
staking in the yfi vault automatically stakes at ygov and automatically rebuys yfi


[10/04/2020 3:05 PM] Neem|eth#0001
it has the same return except compounded


[10/04/2020 3:09 PM] Gimmick#3866
ok the UI just say the wrong rate I guess


[10/04/2020 3:12 PM] 0xGavΞ#4654
@Unknown the new vault strategy has only been implemented 10 days ago before that it was 2%, so selecting 'from inception' will bring that up. I've had my YFI in there since it changed and i can attest it's about 6-10% which i'm happy with as it's market buying YFI.

Is there something wrong with the web app? For the last few days when I’ve gone to yearn.finance I just see a blank page. I’ve tried different browsers, with and without web3 support, and it’s always blank.


[10/04/2020 7:07 PM] Shade Undertree#3776
@CmdrKeen As of right now, I'm able to load https://yearn.finance/ using the latest version of Chrome without issue.


[10/04/2020 7:10 PM] CmdrKeen#2408
Hmm okay looks like that works for me too. Specifically, the browsers I’m having trouble with are Opera (iOS), Coinbase Wallet (iOS) and Safari (MacOS)


[10/04/2020 7:11 PM] Shade Undertree#3776
Unfortunately I can't speak to any of those. I have used MetaMask for iOS successfully.


[10/04/2020 7:11 PM] CmdrKeen#2408

> Speaking of which, someone misspelled the identifier on WalletLink
@CmdrKeen Nice catch, looks like we've got that in 3 repos. Amusingly, I can see 17 repos that have copied yearn including YFII that have that same misspelling carried forward.


[10/04/2020 7:33 PM] CmdrKeen#2408
Interesting


[10/04/2020 7:34 PM] CmdrKeen#2408
Looks like most people forget to change that. Mooniswap (1inch’s Uniswap clone) also still identifies itself as Uniswap over WalletLink...


[10/04/2020 7:45 PM] CmdrKeen#2408
Meanwhile, Zapper.Fi must have forgotten to set that identifier altogether, because it just says “DApp”


[10/04/2020 7:46 PM] Shade Undertree#3776
I sent up pull requests to fix the WalletLink app name in the relevant repositories.

[10/04/2020 7:47 PM] Shade Undertree#3776
So hopefully you'll see the correct name soon. As for the other issues, we'll probably have to wait for DarkGhost7 to collect more feedback to diagnose the issue.

Hello there, As a new user of DeFi, I've made a small test investment of $255 in the yEarn curv.fi/fy LP vault. What are the best methods for acquiring the YFI token? I have none at this point in time. And, is a calculator available for determining the level of fees that can be claimed based on the number of YFI tokens held/staked? Thanks.


[10/05/2020 12:29 PM] vany#0365
The only way to obtain yfi is by purchasing it now. You can check out https://yieldfarming.info and go to the yearn governance tab to find out info on fee returns

ok!! i see them in deposits on zapper.... but why not on the yearn page?? also how do i get them back once i want to....

@Unknown You sure you are on the correct yearn website?

Hello everyone , im not sure if this is proper channel but , when I want connect trust wallet or MetaMask on Earn tab on the website , nothing happens , but other works normally like coinbase etc...

I'm using Argent to connect to yearn.finance and keep getting this message when I connect my wallet. It appears that my wallet is connected, but I can't see any of my holdings.  Argent says the problem is on the yearn side.  Anyone else having this problem?

Hello there, I now have YFI token holdings in the yearn.finance vault. How do I complete the governance staking process? My balance at https://ygov.finance/stake displays 0 YFI instead of the balance at the yearn.finance vault. Thanks.


[10/05/2020 5:28 PM] arberx#3367
If you have less than 1 YFI it doesn't show


[10/05/2020 5:29 PM] arberx#3367
You can use something like zapper.fi to see the balance


[10/05/2020 5:56 PM] LizardKing#0692
Stupid newb here! - deposited YFI and DAI in the Vaults, but what I understand is that Curve.FI/y has the highest growth. How do I convert my holdings to Curve within Yearn.Finance? Tnx!


[10/05/2020 6:03 PM] arberx#3367
You can "zap" your dia to y.curve.fi and deposit in the vault: https://yearn.finance/zap


[10/05/2020 6:10 PM] Cryptodigits#1039
Thanks, @arberx. Yes, my YFI is less than 1. I've been using zapper.fi and can see my balance. Just discovered that the transaction cost for staking my small amount of YFI is just too high. I'll have to pass on governance staking for the time being.


[10/05/2020 6:18 PM] LizardKing#0692
> You can “zap” your dia to y.curve.fi and deposit in the vault: https://yearn.finance/zap
@arberx  tnx! DAI has similar returns so, YFI is what I  need to convert but that’s not an option to zap...

@Unknown If you mean the y vault (yUSD), withdrawing less than 2.08 million yCRV would be fee free at the moment (subject to change any time).


[10/06/2020 6:10 AM] southseacompany#8897
If you mean the Curve y pool, then there is no fee if withdrawing in pool proportions.

@southseacompany thanks


[10/06/2020 11:42 AM] Cryptodigits#1039
Hello there, For trialling governance staking, I have 0.0133 YFI ($239.85). Currently, the transaction fee for staking the full amount is $508.18. In claiming yEarn profit-sharing based on current rates, how long would it take to recoup the transaction fee? Thanks.


[10/06/2020 11:44 AM] kx9x#3778
I honestly don't believe that one bit. Are you 100% sure all the tx inputs are correct and the gas limit isn't outrageously high?


[10/06/2020 11:44 AM] kx9x#3778
$508.18 tx fee would require both a massive gas price and an absurd gas limit needing to be reserved


[10/06/2020 11:54 AM] southseacompany#8897
An excessive transaction fee is often Metamask's way of telling you that the transaction will fail. Have you done an approval transaction for a sufficient amount first?


[10/06/2020 12:29 PM] Cryptodigits#1039
As a very new user of DeFi, I might be doing something wrong. I already have the 0.0133 YFI ($239.85) in the yearn.finance vault. I was expecting to see the respective amount at https://ygov.finance/stake. If I understand correctly: The amount isn't displayed there because the amount is less than 1 YFI? So, I input 0.0133, clicked 'Stake'. Metamask now shows amount + gas fee = £421.55 ($546.55). Gas is 134 gwei. Is the 0.0133 YFI included in the £421.55? If so, how do I apply the 0.0133 YFI in the yearn.finance vault, to governance staking? Thanks.


[10/06/2020 12:34 PM] artfullyContrived#1065
@Cryptodigits When you deposit Yfi in the vault you get yYfi.
You can not and you do not need to stake the yyfi in gov.


[10/06/2020 12:34 PM] kx9x#3778
You do not own any YFI anymore. You exchanged your YFI for vault shares called yYFI, which represents your share in the vault. Staking and the vault are 2 separate options for your YFI, you cannot do both with the same stack.


[10/06/2020 12:35 PM] kx9x#3778
The governance staking will award a user yCRV over time. The vault just takes your YFI, puts it in staking, and then will automatically sell the yCRV for YFI


[10/06/2020 12:36 PM] kx9x#3778
so the vault is doing the staking for you, but selling the profits for more YFI, and you don't have to ever have to waste gas withdrawing yCRV, swapping for YFI, and staking the extra. The vault does this for you


[10/06/2020 12:36 PM] kx9x#3778
Metamask shows a giant fee because you actually have no YFI in your wallet and the contract throws an error

{Reactions}
👍 

[10/06/2020 12:38 PM] artfullyContrived#1065
Additionally you can still use your yYFI to vote.


[10/06/2020 1:02 PM] Cryptodigits#1039
What an education in a few short sentences! The picture is now clearer. 🙂 Thanks, @Unknown and @kx9x. So, as things currently stand, I should have no concerns regarding Yearn profit-sharing and voting? The yearn.finance vault suffices?


[10/06/2020 1:03 PM] kx9x#3778
Exactly, as long as you are okay with your profits being distributed as YFI rather than yCRV, then the vault is the place to be


[10/06/2020 1:07 PM] Cryptodigits#1039
@kx9xAwesome!


[10/06/2020 1:21 PM] yowassup#0972
Is there an easy way to swap your yfi from gov to yfi vault?


[10/06/2020 1:27 PM] vany#0365
Withdrawal and deposit is the only way


[10/06/2020 2:01 PM] kx9x#3778
you can also trade your yYFI for YFI, but I doubt that pair has any notable liquidity


[10/06/2020 2:01 PM] kx9x#3778
so vany is right, your best bet is exiting the staking and depositing into the vault. that is what I did myself


[10/06/2020 2:05 PM] vany#0365
I’ve checked it a few times and it’s always been better to withdrawal (for me)

im trying to withdraw from the ycrvBUSD vault but it is quoting me 1.11 ETH !!!


[10/07/2020 1:11 AM] kano#7577
is this right


[10/07/2020 1:37 AM] kx9x#3778
no, you have an issue in your TX and your wallet is giving you a glitched estimate


[10/07/2020 1:37 AM] kx9x#3778
Are you sure you have ycrvBUSD to withdraw?


[10/07/2020 2:06 AM] kano#7577
100% sure!


[10/07/2020 2:08 AM] kano#7577
ok i see the gas limit in metamask is `11874977` should i use as an approriate gas limit @kx9x


[10/07/2020 2:21 AM] kano#7577
the transaction has reverted with the error message `Fail with error 'slippage'`


[10/07/2020 2:22 AM] kx9x#3778
Metamask put such a large gas limit because it determined the TX would fail


[10/07/2020 2:23 AM] kx9x#3778
Normally should only be like $6 bucks or so to withdraw


[10/07/2020 2:23 AM] kx9x#3778
On my phone, so cannot look at the code right now but


[10/07/2020 2:24 AM] kx9x#3778
A slippage error is weird. I didn't even know that was a thing in vaults


[10/07/2020 2:26 AM] kx9x#3778
> the transaction has reverted with the error message `Fail with error 'slippage'`
@Unknown that honestly looks like a uniswap error rather than a yearn vault error


[10/07/2020 2:27 AM] kx9x#3778
are you sure you didn't like leave a random pending tx on uniswap and then fail to reject it


[10/07/2020 2:27 AM] kx9x#3778
and then it showed up before the prompt for the yearn withdrawal tx


[10/07/2020 2:28 AM] kano#7577
i was thinking itr sounded like a uniswap, im trying to figurte it out from the strategy but im no expert in how the yearn contracts work together


[10/07/2020 2:28 AM] kx9x#3778
I can call withdrawAll on the ycrvBUSD contract right now for a gas limit of 88977 which is less than $2 at 54 gwei


[10/07/2020 2:28 AM] kano#7577
and no i do not have any pending tx anywhere


[10/07/2020 2:29 AM] kano#7577
so i set the limit to 300000, but the revert has nothing to do with the estimation


[10/07/2020 2:30 AM] kx9x#3778
metamask will always estimate `11874977` if the tx will fail


[10/07/2020 2:30 AM] kx9x#3778
and the tx you are trying to do is withdrawAll on this contract? https://etherscan.io/address/0x2994529c0652d127b7842094103715ec5299bbed#writeContract

i am going to interact with the contract directly on ethertscan


[10/07/2020 2:37 AM] kx9x#3778

[10/07/2020 2:54 AM] kx9x#3778
interesting, the yVaultCheck requires that the slippage caused by a withdrawal is less than 0.01%

```JS
    // No rebalance implementation for lower fees and faster swaps
    function withdraw(uint _shares) public {
        IERC20(address(vault)).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _shares);
        IERC20 _underlying = IERC20(vault.token());
        
        uint _expected = vault.balanceOf(address(this));
        _expected = _expected.mul(vault.getPricePerFullShare()).div(1e18);
        _expected = _expected.mul(9999).div(10000);
        
        uint _before = _underlying.balanceOf(address(this));
        vault.withdrawAll();
        uint _after = _underlying.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(_after.sub(_before) >= _expected, "slippage");
        _underlying.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _underlying.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```


[10/07/2020 2:55 AM] kx9x#3778
but I feel like this doesn't take into account the 0.5% withdrawal fee? So this check would always fail unless there is enough yCrvBUSD not deployed so that you avoid a withdrawal fee


[10/07/2020 12:20 PM] timbit#5073
When v2 vaults are deployed, does it result in added risk for capital that is already deployed in a v1 stablecoin vault? Ie will liquidity be automatically migrated or will we have the opportunity to do some dd on the v2 vaults before deciding to use them

[10/10/2020 12:53 PM] kx9x#3778
Oh hey


[10/10/2020 12:53 PM] kx9x#3778
I actually have a PR that fixes this


[10/10/2020 12:53 PM] kx9x#3778
and I explained the issue in here:
https://github.com/iearn-finance/iearn-finance/issues/103


[10/10/2020 12:56 PM] kx9x#3778
I see you already snowswapped it


[10/10/2020 12:57 PM] kx9x#3778
but yeah, the TL;DR is that both the yDAI and the yCrvBUSD vaults have an issue where withdrawals will fail if a withdrawal fee occurs, since the slippage equation doesn't take that fee into account


[10/10/2020 12:58 PM] kx9x#3778
so now yearn is losing out on withdrawal fees, making users spend twice the gas, and giving them a much higher chance to fail the TX

> so now yearn is losing out on withdrawal fees, making users spend twice the gas, and giving them a much higher chance to fail the TX
@kx9x Is the number 1 concern that yearn is losing out on withdraw fees? How about users getting screwed on gas, and not being able to get their funds out?


[10/10/2020 6:25 PM] kx9x#3778
Not sure, I am not a team member, just a random trying to contribute


[10/10/2020 6:25 PM] kx9x#3778
You'd have to ask them to figure out what their #1 concern is


[10/10/2020 6:26 PM] kx9x#3778
I am personally concerned about all 3 lol


[10/10/2020 6:26 PM] kx9x#3778
Which is why I made a PR to disable the yVaultCheck for now because it doesn't do anything useful


[10/10/2020 6:27 PM] kx9x#3778
it hasn't been reviewed yet though 😦 so I guess not a priority? seems like it would be pretty important to get this through though


[10/10/2020 6:28 PM] GEBucky#1736
It doesn’t appear that it’s a priority. Appreciate you doing the PR. It doesn’t appear it’s a priority. Just odd they moved all funds into the strategy to now really block all withdrawals, and haven’t called a Harvest in 24 hours. The optics aren’t so great there.


[10/10/2020 6:28 PM] kx9x#3778
you can still call withdraw directly on the vault smart contract, which was what I recommended to the first person who came here about it


[10/10/2020 6:28 PM] kx9x#3778
not exactly a super user friendly workaround though


[10/10/2020 6:29 PM] GEBucky#1736
No you can’t - not anymore


[10/10/2020 6:29 PM] GEBucky#1736
At least not a withdraw all


[10/10/2020 6:29 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, you can go directly to the yCrvBUSD and call withdrawAll


[10/10/2020 6:30 PM] kx9x#3778
you cannot, however, do it successfully most of the time on the yVaultCheck contraxt


[10/10/2020 6:30 PM] kx9x#3778
contract


[10/10/2020 6:30 PM] kx9x#3778
which is the proxy contract that the UI uses to withdraw from the vault


[10/10/2020 6:30 PM] kx9x#3778
which does a slippage check that doesn't make sense from what I can tell

[10/10/2020 6:31 PM] kx9x#3778
you can still just go to this and write "withdrawAll"


[10/10/2020 6:33 PM] kx9x#3778
and basically my PR just makes the UI withdrawAll and withdraw button target the vault contract directly rather than going to this yVaultCheck contract


[10/10/2020 6:36 PM] GEBucky#1736
Thanks - appreciate it. That will be a good backup option.


[10/10/2020 6:36 PM] kx9x#3778
no problem


[10/10/2020 6:36 PM] kx9x#3778
it also affects the yDAI vault, but I haven't yet seen a failed withdrawal on that vault


[10/10/2020 6:38 PM] GEBucky#1736
Maybe because there are funds in Vault that aren't in strategy. It might be the 0.5pct fee that's tripping it.


[10/10/2020 6:40 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah


[10/10/2020 6:40 PM] GEBucky#1736
About $500K, whereas the BUSD has all been deployed to strategy


[10/10/2020 6:40 PM] kx9x#3778
the 0.5% fee will always cause the "slippage" error


[10/10/2020 6:40 PM] kx9x#3778
because the slippage calculation doesn't take into account the fee and checks for a 99.99% return


[10/10/2020 6:40 PM] kx9x#3778
so it becomes impossible to withdraw if there aren't enough tokens not yet deployed


[10/10/2020 6:41 PM] kx9x#3778
so if anyone tries to withdraw more than 500k DAI, then it will fail similarly


[10/10/2020 6:43 PM] RooSteel#5405

@Unknown just use metamask


[10/10/2020 8:38 PM] Cergat#5149
Hmmm... I’ll try that. Not sure if it’s necessarily a trust wallet issue, though. On github I saw people were having issues with other wallets, too.

Noob Metamask Question. I have a transaction that I cancelled in metamask, the transaction isn't appearing on etherscan put it's still pending on Metamask. When does the transaction go into the mempool? and how do I clear it from Metamask? its been about 15 minutes since I cancelled it


[10/11/2020 12:04 AM] sadcat#1111
cancelled transaction is just a zero eth send to yourself


[10/11/2020 12:04 AM] sadcat#1111
are you sure it's not confirmed on etherscan?


[10/11/2020 12:05 AM] sadcat#1111
but if it's really pending you can replace it manually by sending a new transaction (it can be whatever) with the same nonce


[10/11/2020 12:05 AM] sadcat#1111
to do that, enable custom nonces in settings


[10/11/2020 12:05 AM] Hammerdin#5056
there is nothing appearing on Etherscan


[10/11/2020 12:05 AM] Hammerdin#5056
yeah ok, I'l give that a go.


[10/11/2020 12:06 AM] sadcat#1111
you can just ignore it if you don't have to make any transaction


[10/11/2020 12:06 AM] sadcat#1111
you can also try resetting metamask (then reentering your seed or connecting hw wallet again)


[10/11/2020 12:07 AM] Hammerdin#5056
I might do the reset and see if that fixes it


[10/11/2020 12:08 AM] Hammerdin#5056

Can any mod or someone help me? I tried withdrawing from the yeth vaults and set a decent gas/gwei but now my transaction shows it’s been pending for hours on metamask however etherscan doesn’t show any transaction in the history. To cancel the transaction, I used the same eth address to send 0 eth to myself with the same nounce but nothing happened. How can I fix this and properly withdraw from the yeth vault?


[10/11/2020 12:32 AM] sadcat#1111

@kx9x hi , have you found the solution. it seems all the recent txs of this vault contract failed

If withdrawing and seeing high gas, use Zapper.fi to withdraw as an alternative solution to using yearn website @Unknown

> Hi, ive been holding yUSD for a few months now. I thought it was supposed to accrue interest but im trying to convert it back to USDT now using Zapper and im actually getting less back? Is that right?
@RooSteel  Zapper uses liquidity pools I believe. If you withdraw yourself, you’ll get back yCRV then you can withdraw whatever you want from Curve.

[10/11/2020 11:09 AM] kx9x#3778
Yeah, another solution is to use etherscan to call withdraw on the yDAI vault contract directly.

Just in case I linked the wrong one since I am on mobile


[10/11/2020 11:17 AM] kx9x#3778
But yeah, if you read the issue on GitHub in full


[10/11/2020 11:17 AM] kx9x#3778
You will see the issue is that the yearn withdraw goes through a middleman contract called yVaultCheck


[10/11/2020 11:18 AM] kx9x#3778
Which has broken logic and sometimes always fails (details in the issue I linked)


[10/11/2020 11:19 AM] kx9x#3778
This yVaultCheck just calls withdraw on the yDAI vault contract and does a broken slippage check that can fail for no good reason


[10/11/2020 11:19 AM] kx9x#3778
So the mitigation is to instead call withdraw on the vault contract rather than the yVaultCheck contract


[10/11/2020 11:19 AM] kx9x#3778
I also have a pull request open to mitigate this, but it was ice boxed, so I guess it won't come in anytime soon


[10/11/2020 11:19 AM] BT#3500

[10/11/2020 11:22 AM] kx9x#3778
Yeah, I need help from you all to actually read what I am saying. The UI for yearn's withdraw goes through this yVaultCheck and it always breaks if there isn't enough DAI not-yet-deployed to the strat. Basically if a withdraw ever hits a withdrawal fee (0.5%) the TX will fail

{Reactions}

[10/11/2020 11:22 AM] kx9x#3778
This affects both the yDAI and yCrvBUSD vaults


[10/11/2020 11:23 AM] kx9x#3778
Withdrawing from the vaults contracts directly, NOT the yVaultCheck, using etherscan or something similar will result in a good withdrawal, but with the 0.5% withdrawal fee of course


[10/11/2020 11:23 AM] kx9x#3778
And withdrawing with the vault directly using the contract directly also costs half the gas


[10/11/2020 11:24 AM] BT#3500
I’ve just used Zapper as an alternative and I’ve personally seen this issue for yDAI and yCRVBUSD so makes sense.


[10/11/2020 11:24 AM] kaseda#8858

Hello, I've deposited my YFI into its vault over a month ago, and just noticed that its current balance is lower than my initial deposit. Is this expected? My understanding of the vaults is "number go up"...


[10/12/2020 6:52 PM] Neem|eth#0001
you are probably mixing it up; you received less yyfi than yfi (which you put in) because yyfi is worth more yfi per day

[10/12/2020 7:09 PM] sina#7327
I understand I would get fewer yYFI, but it seems like the conversion to YFI shows as less as well


[10/12/2020 7:09 PM] sina#7327
(ie. deposit was 0.4YFI, it's now worth 0.3968 YFI)


[10/12/2020 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
You need to find your transaction where you deposited the YFI


[10/12/2020 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
and double check on etherscan what exactly happened when you deposited


[10/12/2020 7:10 PM] sina#7327
Uhh, what do you mean, what should I be looking for?


[10/12/2020 7:11 PM] sina#7327
The initial deposit worked as expected, I saw some amount of yYFI, equivalent to 0.4 YFI


[10/12/2020 7:11 PM] sina#7327
And for a few weeks after I was gaining marginal amount of YFI


[10/12/2020 7:11 PM] sina#7327
But now checking back after a few additional weeks, I suddenly see the number has gone down


[10/12/2020 7:12 PM] kx9x#3778
yes, but you need to go and check the tx log to verify exactly what happened. the log will show you the YFI you deposited and the yYFI you received in exchange


[10/12/2020 7:13 PM] kx9x#3778
because the UI may have shown that you deposited 0.4 YFI, but it might have just been 0.39XX because of the rounding in the UI


[10/12/2020 7:13 PM] kx9x#3778
etherscan will show the actual amount you deposited

[10/12/2020 7:15 PM] sina#7327
Looks like you're right!


[10/12/2020 7:15 PM] kx9x#3778
you deposited 0.25 + 0.145458894097354266  = 0.395458894097354266 yfi


[10/12/2020 7:16 PM] kx9x#3778
and that is now worth 0.3968 or so

> Hello. I'm trying to write a query on Dune analytics to find the total usdc in the yusdc vault. Here is my query: https://explore.duneanalytics.com/queries/11429/source#22695. It currently matches the amount thats on etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x597aD1e0c13Bfe8025993D9e79C69E1c0233522e, but it's different from the amount on feel the yearn: https://feel-the-yearn.app/vaults.
@Unknown I also tried to add the transactions with the dForce contract, but it amounts to the same number...


[10/13/2020 11:42 PM] e_e#2515
The aLink pool shows 58% apy on my computer but only 25% apy on my laptop. i deposit my link from my laptop - any idea why the discrepancy might exist? it is just a visual bug? yieldfarming.info shows it at ~26% apy at the moment


[10/14/2020 2:23 AM] ONI#6888
yield farming is using daily apy which isnt at all accurate for the alink vault as its harvest() function is called not as often as others.


[10/14/2020 2:23 AM] ONI#6888
i would check your real yield here https://yvault-roi.netlify.app/ @Unknown

if i have 1 yYFI in the vault, and let's say it's reached 1.2 YFI - is there a good way to see something like the daily APY growth breakdown of my personal investment? - not the vaults themselves, or another tool to view this as what it's worth? for example Zapper only shows the yYFI not the current YFI value


[10/14/2020 10:50 AM] twosevenkid#8806
the dashboard for example shows daily / yearly /weekly growth, but not the actual growth diff between 1.2 and 1 (0.2) and that correlation to dollars, but what seems more of a projection

Hi guys! I need a little help with withdrawal from yvault. I made approve yDAI spend limit and now I want to withdraw my yDAI, but when Metamask opens it sets gwei to 88 and gas limit to 1000000 :pepegasp:  It is aksing me 0.44 ETH in gas to withdraw. I tried putting gas limit to 100000, but my transaction failed and my ETH is lost for that transaction. I don't have that big of an amount of DAI there that I could afford paying that much for one transaction. How to avoid it - if it even is possible and what setting should I use 😟


[10/14/2020 11:47 AM] sadcat#1111
Gas Used by Transaction:
829,951 (62.63%)


[10/14/2020 11:47 AM] sadcat#1111
that's about $30


[10/14/2020 11:48 AM] sadcat#1111
are you sure the limit is 1M and not 10M?


[10/14/2020 11:48 AM] sadcat#1111
if 10M it means the withdrawal is failing


[10/14/2020 11:49 AM] sadcat#1111
for smaller sums it may make more sense to sell ydai on uniswap

[10/14/2020 1:26 PM] NijeMladen#2224
@sadcat I just tried again and it is 0.18 eth for a fee.. Is there a way for settings setup so it is cheaper? And I haven't used uniswap yet.. How do I sell it on uniswap?

[10/14/2020 3:52 PM] Cryptonoob#8776
Can anyone help me figure out what I did wrong and how to fix it? I think the process went as follows; 1 Used Zap on yearn.finance to convert Dai to busd.curve.fi  ---- 2 went vaults and deposited into the busd lp vault  ----- 3  withdraw from the vault ------ 4  used zap on yearn to try and go from busd - USDC (this may have been the cause)  After this it kind of got wierd... It seemed like it went back into the busd LP Vault automatically.  ---------- 5 so after this i withdrew again from the vaults page.  I cant remember if i went to zapper.fi and tried to withdraw and maybe set the gas fee to low and was pending so i tried to cancel on metamask yet it still shows as pending on https://etherscan.io/address/0xb87a5a58c56196864ef8d6403b08c9e741ce7dd2 i am obviously new to this.

you have a pending tx for a withdrawDAI call on the yCurveZapOutV4 contract


[10/14/2020 4:15 PM] kx9x#3778
the gas price you put is 1 gwei

which will just never ever be accepted by the miners


[10/14/2020 4:17 PM] Cryptonoob#8776
ok so i tried to cancel on meta mask and it shows as canceled. but not on etherscan. so do i need to try and send a nonce of 13 back to myself to clear it?


[10/14/2020 4:18 PM] kx9x#3778
you deposited into the yCrvBUSD vault, then you withdrew, you then deposited again, and then withdrew a second time

@Unknown that's weird that metamask shows it as cancelled


[10/14/2020 4:20 PM] kx9x#3778
and yeah, I think the solution is to send 0 ether to yourself with the same nonce at a normal gas price


[10/14/2020 4:21 PM] Cryptonoob#8776
Maybe i did 🙂 i dont know... I dont think i did though. just trying to learn this whole thing. Not worried if loose a little. but would like to try and get back the 149 i put it.


[10/14/2020 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
I think setting your own tx nonce is an advanced feature in metamask, so you might have to enable it in settings


[10/14/2020 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
typically metamask would automate this by having a cancel button for the pending tx


[10/14/2020 4:22 PM] kx9x#3778
but metamask might have a bug where it thinks it was already cancelled


[10/14/2020 4:22 PM] kx9x#3778

Yes

There is a bug that sometimes causes crvBUSD withdraws to fail if you use yearn.finance (it also costs twice as much gas)


[10/14/2020 5:01 PM] kx9x#3778
Zapper works as well


[10/14/2020 5:02 PM] kx9x#3778
Either you have to withdraw from the vault and then withdraw from curve.fi


[10/14/2020 5:02 PM] kx9x#3778
Or you can just zap


[10/14/2020 5:02 PM] kx9x#3778
Zap is probably easiest


[10/14/2020 5:02 PM] Cryptonoob#8776
both cost about the same gas?


[10/14/2020 5:03 PM] kx9x#3778
Good question, I am not exactly sure tbh


[10/14/2020 5:03 PM] kx9x#3778
Because I don't know much curve.fi's withdraw costs


[10/14/2020 5:03 PM] kx9x#3778
You could probably dig around and compare if you go to the contract in etherscan and see other withdrawals


[10/14/2020 5:24 PM] Cryptonoob#8776
i dont know what i am missing. I went to the zapper.io and hit withdraw. hit confirm paid another transaction fee... but still dont have Dai

sometimes instead of unwinding your position to invest insomething else swapping on uniswap is a good deal

> How do I convert yDAI back to DAI through Yearn?
@JoeyC I got a great suggestion here to simply sell it on Uniswap for DAI. If yearn.finance has crazy fee just do it there


[10/15/2020 4:31 PM] kingscrown#1243
why the fees are so big on y finacne now?


[10/15/2020 4:35 PM] kingscrown#1243
to witdraw DAI from vault wants 50 usd..


[10/15/2020 6:08 PM] vany#0365
Well there are 2 different fees, tx fees yearn has no control over, and then withdrawal fees are .5%. I’ve noticed even with a fee I’m getting more from yearn than uniswap (btc vault and yUSD vault)


[10/15/2020 9:09 PM] UltraSoundMonkey#1440
> to witdraw DAI from vault wants 50 usd..
@Unknown Are you wanting to withdraw more DAI than is in the vault buffer?  (check https://yearn.finance/stats and subtract strategy holdings from vault holdings).  If so then it means the strategy has to get funds back to the vault which will increase gas costs. If you withfdraw less than the buffer amount, it should be cheaper~~ with no withdrawl fee.~~ -  sorry I think withdrawal fee is not a factor here


[10/15/2020 9:11 PM] kx9x#3778
also yearn.finance has higher dai withdraw fees than y.finance right now due to the yvault check


[10/15/2020 9:11 PM] kx9x#3778
you can cut it down by half on y.finance. see #🔗links


[10/15/2020 10:01 PM] swandoctor#2720
Hey guys I read on a chat that when you deposit into a vault you can still get liquidated?


[10/15/2020 10:02 PM] vany#0365
what vault are you talking about?


[10/15/2020 10:02 PM] swandoctor#2720
How would this work?


[10/15/2020 10:02 PM] swandoctor#2720
for example the aLink vault


[10/15/2020 10:02 PM] Vsear#6984
Yes delegated credit vaults borrow money on your deposit to farm, but they automatically repay if the loan gets anywhere close to liquidation


[10/15/2020 10:03 PM] Vsear#6984
It would take some real black swan flash crash stuff to liquidate them


[10/15/2020 10:03 PM] swandoctor#2720
the full amount?


[10/15/2020 10:03 PM] vany#0365
vaults get whitelisted, like on maker. to see price feeds way before they apply to the contracts so it can keep the loan healthy


[10/15/2020 10:03 PM] swandoctor#2720
Is there a penalty?


[10/15/2020 10:03 PM] Vsear#6984
No, even if it happened it would be partial liquidation until the loan health was restored


[10/15/2020 10:03 PM] swandoctor#2720
ah ok


[10/15/2020 10:04 PM] Vsear#6984
Yeah for the Maker vaults (ETH) you have a full hour to pay back so liquidation is only just technically possible IMO. But for the Link vault (Aave) it could feasibly happen if sergey betrayed hard enough


[10/15/2020 10:05 PM] swandoctor#2720
Whats the ratio for liquidation?


[10/15/2020 10:06 PM] vany#0365
not aure on Aave but Maker ETH vault is 150%


[10/15/2020 10:06 PM] vany#0365
sounds like vesear knows Aave


[10/15/2020 10:10 PM] kx9x#3778
our health factor puts link liquidation at link price of $2.73 last I checked (yesterday)


[10/15/2020 10:10 PM] Vsear#6984
On Aave it keeps a health factor of 3 or 4, don't remember which


[10/15/2020 10:17 PM] zai#0518
4

@kx9x  and @Monero thanks for the tips. I went to y.finance/vaults instead and I'm connected with my MetaMask wallet, I have screenshots when I first deposited the DAI, definitely using the same address. Vault still shows empty. Looks like a frontend problem then? If I want to withdraw the money, can I just call the withdrawAll function through Etherscan directly? Thanks for the help.  And thanks for the UNI tip @Monero , I didn't know I had those 🙂 Still fairly new to all this.


[10/18/2020 7:14 PM] rueckstiess#0511
Quick update. I re-installed MetaMask and connected my hardware wallet again and now it's showing the DAI. Thanks again for the help, appreciate it.

Hey guys, for a token list am currently creating I am struggeling a bit to name some of the yearn tokens. Specific example, those two addresses representing yDAI: 0x16de59092dAE5CcF4A1E6439D611fd0653f0Bd01 & 0xC2cB1040220768554cf699b0d863A3cd4324ce32.

this change might fix your issue, but the fix is only in y.finance for now


[10/19/2020 2:33 PM] babaganush11#3577
oh, interesting. ok so that's a bit better but the gas is still ~$100. is that normal?


[10/19/2020 2:35 PM] kx9x#3778
are you withdraw from yDAI or yCrvBusd


[10/19/2020 2:35 PM] babaganush11#3577
yDAI


[10/19/2020 2:35 PM] kx9x#3778
one thing to consider is that the gas limit is probably higher than will actually be used


[10/19/2020 2:36 PM] kx9x#3778
another thing is that if you are withdrawing more than the difference between the vault holdings and the strategy holdings


[10/19/2020 2:36 PM] kx9x#3778
you will withdraw from the strat, which costs more gas


[10/19/2020 2:36 PM] kx9x#3778

[10/19/2020 2:36 PM] kx9x#3778
so if you withdraw more than 263 DAI worth


[10/19/2020 2:36 PM] kx9x#3778
you will hit a longer code path that requires more gas


[10/19/2020 2:37 PM] kx9x#3778
you could potentially wait until more people deposit and you can withdraw using excess funds in the vault


[10/19/2020 2:37 PM] kx9x#3778
you also avoid the 0.5% withdrawal fee that way


[10/19/2020 2:37 PM] babaganush11#3577
where do you keep an eye on the vault balances?

Withdraw takes the amount of yDAI user owned I now convert the amount of underlying user wants to withdraw to yToken amount before sending it to contract and it works fine.


[10/21/2020 8:24 AM] ONI#6888
@MarketMaster it looks like that is just the fee you could try to swap out of it using a zap, via zapper.fi zerion.io or see if uniswap has a pool for that vault.


[10/21/2020 8:25 AM] ONI#6888
@Unknown yah it should would fine for withdrawal. It has been low as we were unwinding the vault ie farming less with the funds to move over to the new yeth v2 vault soon

{Reactions}
👍 

[10/21/2020 9:32 AM] MarketMaster#5148
same with zapper, approx. 60$


[10/21/2020 10:58 AM] ONI#6888
yah seems like that is just the cost.


[10/21/2020 11:08 AM] ONI#6888
If you pay a withdrawal fee this type of cost makes sense. ie if there isnt enough from the reserve pool (tokens not invested in the strat) to cover you withdrawal as instead of just 2 interactions it has like 20. For this reason it will cost more.


[10/21/2020 11:08 AM] ONI#6888

[10/21/2020 11:17 AM] kx9x#3778
that's a super high gas limit


[10/21/2020 11:17 AM] kx9x#3778
the tx will probably use way less than that, so you won't actually have to end up spending that much


[10/21/2020 11:17 AM] kx9x#3778
but might need to reserve that much due to how gas refunds and gas limits work in the eth vm

and that was with withdrawing from the strategy as well

ok I try on y.finance then


[10/21/2020 2:44 PM] kx9x#3778
high fees due to gas price and gas limit being higher than gas used, the fee will be less than quoted

at 36 gwei though


[10/21/2020 2:47 PM] kx9x#3778
withdrawing is expensive because the money is coming from the strategy


[10/21/2020 2:47 PM] kx9x#3778
since the vault holdings and strategy holdings are equal

[10/21/2020 2:48 PM] kx9x#3778
if you can use snowswap to swap to a different yearn token where there is more in the vault than the strategy


[10/21/2020 2:48 PM] kx9x#3778
then the withdraw will use less gas and also not have a 0.5% withdrawal fee


[10/21/2020 2:48 PM] kx9x#3778
(if and only if you don't withdraw more than the difference between the vault holdings and strat holdings)


[10/21/2020 2:49 PM] kx9x#3778
for example, you can currently withdraw, like 1.3 million crvBUSD for free (no withdrawal fee and also a faster path on withdraw, meaning less gas)


[10/21/2020 2:49 PM] kx9x#3778
you could also try uniswap maybe


[10/21/2020 2:50 PM] kx9x#3778
swap yDAI for something


[10/21/2020 2:50 PM] kx9x#3778
and compare the price difference/slippage to what the tx cost and withdrawal fee is for the DAI vault


[10/21/2020 2:52 PM] Kirk#6970

[10/21/2020 2:57 PM] Kirk#6970
?


[10/21/2020 2:57 PM] Kirk#6970
It will not work ?


[10/21/2020 2:58 PM] Kirk#6970
Because I do not find on Snowswap how to swap yDAI for crvbUSD since it says USD VAULTS and not CURVE vaults


[10/21/2020 2:59 PM] Kirk#6970
ANd on Uniswap yDAI does not appear


[10/21/2020 3:00 PM] kx9x#3778
No miner is going to pick up your tx if the gas price is lower


[10/21/2020 3:00 PM] kx9x#3778
if your limit is low, then you might fail to have enough gas for the tx and it will just fail and waste your money


[10/21/2020 3:00 PM] kx9x#3778
and yes, gas limit needs to be higher than the gas used in certain cases


[10/21/2020 3:01 PM] kx9x#3778
because a tx in the ethereum vm can require more gas to run fully than it ends up using due to gas refunds


[10/21/2020 3:02 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, looks like snowswap only has a few pairs


[10/21/2020 3:03 PM] kx9x#3778
you could snowswap to TUSD and then withdraw that and then swap TUSD for DAI on uniswap


[10/21/2020 3:03 PM] kx9x#3778
no clue if that is more or less gas overall, but you can do the math


[10/21/2020 3:04 PM] kx9x#3778
right now like 2800 TUSD can be withdrawn from yearn with no withdrawal fee

I'm trying to withdraw all my dai in a vault and it keeps giving me the same error. Error: [ethjs-rpc] rpc error with payload {"id":307044XXXXX,"jsonrpc":"2.0","params
Any idea how to solve it?


[10/22/2020 1:33 AM] vany#0365
check the pinned message @pm  and try it on y.finance


[10/22/2020 1:38 AM] pm#2933
I tried on y.finance and got same error. Despite I out 0.5% of fee to tx


[10/22/2020 1:38 AM] pm#2933
Any other suggestion?


[10/22/2020 1:39 AM] kx9x#3778
are you using trustwallet/walletconnect


[10/22/2020 1:43 AM] pm#2933
I'm using metamask


[10/22/2020 1:47 AM] pm#2933
Ok. I don't know how it happened but it worked after trying 15 times :)


[10/22/2020 1:48 AM] pm#2933
Thanks for the help. I did go to y.finance and it worked the 3 time I tried it there

Hi, I'm still stucked in ydai withdrawal since 1 month ago and I'm not receiving any answer about when it will be fixed.

I use wallet connect and when accessing y.finance or yearn.finance the following error message appears and all the balances appear empty

any way to withdraw ydai? Neither in zapper and other platforms work


[10/22/2020 12:09 PM] kx9x#3778
have you tried y.finance?


[10/22/2020 12:09 PM] kx9x#3778
also wallet connect is real buggy on yearn's website


[10/22/2020 12:10 PM] kx9x#3778
you can withdraw using etherscan directly on the contract if all else fails


[10/22/2020 12:10 PM] kx9x#3778
and I can show you how to do that, it is pretty easy and you should be able to verify each step and make sure you are in the right place and doing the right thing


[10/22/2020 12:10 PM] kx9x#3778
> when accessing y.finance

I am building a DeFi aggrigator platform, I integrated yEarn yDAI call for deposit and withdraw the deposit works just fine but when i call withdraw I basically pass in the amount of DAI i calculated via the following formula.
uint amount = YToken(_yToken).balanceOf(address(_wallet));
uint exchangeRate = YToken(_yToken).getPricePerFullShare();
withdrawAmount = amount.mul(exchangeRate).div(10 ** 18);

The the code above seems to b a conversion of the shares of yDAI that we have to DAI itself and the withdraw function takes the amount of shares in yDAI that user has am i correct?

When you withdrew from the Eth vault, you received wrapped Eth (wETH)


[10/23/2020 6:39 PM] kx9x#3778
if you want to convert that back to Eth, you can use uniswap to unwrap

@Unknown Deposits were disabled and new deposits stopped being added to the dangerous strategy a few days after launch. I'm not sure why you're still in it?


[10/24/2020 10:14 AM] yao#7227
@Unknown you don’t need to have pulled it out (it’s just low APY while a new strategy is set). So don’t worry, funds are safe


[10/24/2020 11:18 AM] beforeman#5463

We've identified a problem with GUSD strategy with decimals not being accounted for in _withdrawSome() which resulted in smaller withdrawals with the rest being gifted to the vault balance. Deposits disabled. A fix will be deployed shortly. The user will be reimbursed.

@0xnook if gas prices are low it doesn’t cost much to put it into gov


[10/25/2020 5:16 PM] yao#7227
But at these prices it’s best to put in the yfi vault and use the earnings to buy yfi cheap!


[10/25/2020 5:55 PM] 0xnook#5326
So you can be inactive in gov (mostly to save on gas) and still accrue fees?

Hey - Is the GUSD vault showing the correct APY? I searched the channel and I see people talking about it showing an incorrect APY. not sure if that has been fixed - most recent discussion on this was hours ago.


[10/25/2020 8:14 PM] e_e#2515
The GUSD pool on curve is showing 43%apy atm. I’m assuming that’s closer to accurate?

depends on you definition of correct 🙂


[10/25/2020 8:28 PM] banteg#5000
currently it has no active strategy and the funds just sit in the vault


[10/25/2020 8:29 PM] banteg#5000
but the share price has grown to 1.7 as a result of the bug


[10/25/2020 8:36 PM] e_e#2515
Sorry I’m a little confused. So, at the moment, funds in the vault are not being used, but when the bug is resolved, will the APY of 2900% be recalculated? Or is that still an expected return?


[10/25/2020 8:37 PM] banteg#5000
it will be recalculated

{Reactions}
👌 

[10/25/2020 8:37 PM] banteg#5000
i mean the site calculates the apy from the vault creation and it will be shown incorrectly for quite some while cause the share price has grown so much


[10/25/2020 8:38 PM] banteg#5000
or maybe it doesn't and im out of the loop

I initially thought GUSD to yGUSD was 1:1, but even if it's not, seems like a wonky ratio of some sort


[10/25/2020 10:48 PM] ONI#6888
it works the same as all the vaults


[10/25/2020 10:49 PM] ONI#6888
you get less than you put in as ygusd will increase in price constantly


[10/25/2020 10:49 PM] ONI#6888
that is the yield it accures


[10/25/2020 10:56 PM] e_e#2515
but the gusd vault isn't farming anything, so it's not accruing any yield, right?
but @Unknown yGUSD isn't 1=1 with GUSD. it's worth more than $1 for each yGUSD. when you pull your money out, you'll have equal to what you put in, minus fees


[10/25/2020 11:03 PM] 0xHephaestus#5440
ah gotcha, I incorrectly assumed the 1=1 ratio. prolly because my brain sees USD and immediately thinks it should be close-ish to the value of a dollar. thanks for the reminder 👍


[10/25/2020 11:09 PM] 0xHephaestus#5440
@Unknown would you know what contract should I watch to see when the GUSD vault starts farming?


[10/25/2020 11:13 PM] 0xHephaestus#5440
right. the vault is actually separate from the controller and the strategy. 

quick feedback: the copy on the newsletter does look a bit misleading then.
```This vault deposits GUSD into the recently released GUSD+3Pool MetaPool on Curve Finance, which can be found here. The liquidity provider (LP) token received after depositing into this pool is deposited into the liquidity gauge at Curve.fi ```

might be something to adjust for future newsletters. I still appreciate all the work that was put into it though. thanks for keeping us up to date on the y ecosystem.


[10/25/2020 11:40 PM] charlies1#5638
@banteg OK...when I go to zapper.fi...it doesnt recognize my yCRV...which is now in my metamask wallet and  named "yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD"   How do I swap this if it doesnt even show up in my wallet on zapper.fi?  So sorry!!!! Thanks for your help! Much appreciated!!

@Unknown
Yes.


[10/25/2020 11:41 PM] Sifu#8484
@Unknown Are you sure that it doesn't appear in your Zapper wallet? It should be under "deposits" on the main page, and visible under the "invest" tab.


[10/25/2020 11:41 PM] charlies1#5638
Thanks so much @Sifu !!!!!   As you can see in my message above...I am not making much progress :-(...


[10/25/2020 11:42 PM] Sifu#8484
Since you want to switch pools, it's probably best not to do a single asset withdrawal/deposit through zapper. I suggest withdrawing proportionally, converting your tusd manually, and then doing a balanced deposit into 3pool

[10/25/2020 11:56 PM] charlies1#5638

Hi guys i have a problem withdrawing from the curve.fi/y LP on yearn.finance. I tried both directly from the website and through zapper.fi always with well enough gas, but after i confirm the trn on metamask - no transaction ever appears on etherscan. Tried with more and more gas and higher gas limit but still the same.  The tokens stay in my vault... Can you help?

We've identified a problem with GUSD strategy with decimals not being accounted for in _withdrawSome() which resulted in smaller withdrawals with the rest being gifted to the vault balance. Deposits disabled. A fix will be deployed shortly. The user will be reimbursed.

0%. No funds currently in strategy.

Dai vault says "Withdrawals might be subject to high slippage due to recent large withdrawal"
What does this mean exactly? A withdrawal isn't an AMM swap so what's slipping?


[10/27/2020 3:56 AM] yao#7227
@bohendo just a guess but - if there is zero dai (or a small amount) in the vault buffer then it may have to withdraw dai from the strategy itself? And if the strategy is investing the dai in CRV pool then that may cause slippage?


[10/27/2020 3:58 AM] bohendo#4221

I'd like to withdraw from the DAI vault but I've noticed there's a message that says "withdrawals might be subject to high slippage due to a recent large withdrawal" can anyone explain:

[10/27/2020 5:29 PM] kx9x#3778

because of a decimal issue

and that "donated" money was calculated as APY


[10/27/2020 5:29 PM] kx9x#3778

@purplezky withdrawing should be fine now, the funds aren't in the strategy right now because there's a slippage issue depositing into the GUSD/3pool on Curve for some reason

@Unknown When you depsoit into a vault you get yVault tokens that represent your share of the vaults liquidity.  For example when you deposit into USDC vault you get yUSDC tokens. 

Transferred in amount refers to when you transfer the vaults yUSDC tokens from another address rather than getting them via depositing via your address.

@Unknown hey all is the GUSD vault APY correct? Seems way too high and expected it to drop significantly but hasn't - wondering if there's an issue with the displayed apy.

why APY on GUYSD is 2000%+ ?


[10/29/2020 1:08 AM] vany#0365
its a bug. the apy is not 2k%. currently the vault is paused


[10/29/2020 1:58 AM] ONI#6888
The GUSD Vault currently has a bug and the apy is not 2000%+, the vault is paused pending an update to fix it.

[10/29/2020 5:14 AM] Slasher77#9478
@Unknown  r u using a mobile？Try use a MetaMask on desktop, Google Extension one would be good. I struggled a little w the wallet thing too.

@Unknown still paused, unfortunately


[10/29/2020 8:18 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
I popped about 1200 gusd into it

[10/29/2020 8:21 PM] vany#0365
ygusd =/ gusd. you can see your 1178 gusd right there


[10/29/2020 8:21 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
ok


[10/29/2020 8:22 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
anyone know if it is safe to withdraw my gusd?


[10/29/2020 8:25 PM] kx9x#3778
yes, it is


[10/29/2020 8:25 PM] kx9x#3778
and you won't be charged a withdrawal fee either


[10/29/2020 8:25 PM] kx9x#3778
666.6 yGUSD will withdraw 1170.0380 GUSD


[10/29/2020 8:26 PM] kx9x#3778
so you will get back $1170.038


[10/29/2020 8:26 PM] kx9x#3778

[10/29/2020 11:20 PM] mmass999#5215
So you deposited 1200 and you're getting 1170!! Why the loss? > cool. thanks
@ConEtiquette


[10/29/2020 11:21 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
about 1200


[10/29/2020 11:21 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
1178 is about 1200


[10/29/2020 11:21 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
i just wasnt being specific


[10/29/2020 11:21 PM] mmass999#5215
So how much did you make? And how long did you deposit for


[10/29/2020 11:21 PM] mmass999#5215
Because the apy is insane


[10/29/2020 11:22 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
pennies. the apy isnt accurate


[10/29/2020 11:22 PM] mmass999#5215
I see


[10/29/2020 11:22 PM] ConEtiquette#4242
there was an issue with it, hence me asking about the safety of withdrawing


[10/29/2020 11:22 PM] mmass999#5215

[10/29/2020 11:24 PM] mmass999#5215
Yfv has a model where proposal voting doesn't need gas


[10/29/2020 11:25 PM] mmass999#5215
Is this the same in yfi gov vault?


[10/29/2020 11:30 PM] vany#0365
yes yfi currently uses snapshot


[10/29/2020 11:37 PM] mmass999#5215
I am.sorry , snapshot means no gas fees?


[10/29/2020 11:37 PM] mmass999#5215

hello I wish to invest in curve.fi/busd lp pool. Can someone please confirm I got this right? 
First I have to go to https://www.curve.fi/busd/deposit and deposit there to get LPs and then I deposit them in the appropriate vault here https://yearn.finance/vaults right?

{Embed}
https://www.curve.fi/busd/deposit
Curve.fi
Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for: extremely efficient stablecoin trading, low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.


[11/01/2020 1:45 PM] j.#6352
Yes, or you could use zapper to do one transaction instead of two


[11/01/2020 1:46 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
sounds good but will I be able to get all the rewards and interest with that too?


[11/01/2020 1:47 PM] j.#6352
what rewards? YFI is no longer being distributed


[11/01/2020 1:49 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
so the yean.finance vaults don't earn interest?


[11/01/2020 1:50 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
From what I understand the YF vaults give a certain interest and the curve pools another. The total interest I would get would be the sum of the two...


[11/01/2020 1:50 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
Is that incorrect?


[11/01/2020 1:51 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
Maybe "reward" is the wrong word. Sorry I'm a defi noob still


[11/01/2020 1:53 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
Also, I can't find the place in zapper to do that... could someone help?


[11/01/2020 1:54 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
I think I found it, it was kind of hidden


[11/01/2020 1:58 PM] j.#6352
You can see the current strategy for the vault youre interested in at https://stats.finance/yearn


[11/01/2020 1:59 PM] j.#6352
yes in zapper, go to the Invest tab, then click Invest, and look for yearn then select busd


[11/01/2020 2:01 PM] j.#6352
what you would earn from from the busd vault is the curve busd lp token, but you can always use zapper to zap out to eth or dai or something else


[11/01/2020 2:17 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
Thanks. I am still confused


[11/01/2020 2:17 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392

[11/01/2020 3:48 PM] Qfen#8385
Hello, please what's the kovan address for yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDS and yTUSD ?


[11/01/2020 4:15 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
Why is the value shown in the vaults less than the actual value? It is showing me around 90% of what I actually put in. The value of what I put in shows in zapper.fi


[11/01/2020 5:48 PM] yao#7227
@Unknown the value of yTOKENs is higher than the value of the token you put in, so you don’t get 1:1


[11/01/2020 5:49 PM] yao#7227
When you withdraw you get your original value back + interest


[11/01/2020 6:06 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
thanks!


[11/01/2020 7:19 PM] Marcus Prosocialise (Catalonia)#3392
There is no cover for yearn finance  or curve. Does that mean people don't trust them enough?

[11/02/2020 1:20 PM] henry_reed#0220
Like, it get it, totally dumb move - I havent gotten my consul fully set up to read the different strategies, so I think it might be an API call, but I used metamask to make the transfer.  If you could provide any links to how-to- on the more custom strategies, contracts -- shit maybe even the basics, it would be helpful


[11/02/2020 1:20 PM] ONI#6888
you need to go write withdrawal


[11/02/2020 1:21 PM] ONI#6888
but im not sure how much you have in the strategy


[11/02/2020 1:21 PM] ONI#6888
you might as well keep it in there for now and try to make some gains? withdrawing might be subject to fees


[11/02/2020 1:22 PM] henry_reed#0220
some of my issue is not having the IDE/compiler up - I dont plan on withdrawing immediately, I'm just curious on how.


[11/02/2020 1:22 PM] henry_reed#0220
Not a large amount like 288


[11/02/2020 1:23 PM] henry_reed#0220
Can you make the withdrawl calls via etherscan, or is this different> I saw the getting started documentation on the github


[11/02/2020 1:23 PM] ONI#6888
you can try to call 22 withdraw under write


[11/02/2020 1:23 PM] ONI#6888
and put in your address that might work


[11/02/2020 1:25 PM] henry_reed#0220
That makes sense - Do you have any other docs to how i can get up for the IDE, got stuck on the getting started guide after trying to get JS up and running

[11/02/2020 9:41 PM] La_ma1n#1267
Hello,

I bought around 2eth of first released and deployed contract on Uniswap (0x9696...). It could be fair to have a swap mechanism with the new one


[11/02/2020 9:42 PM] La_ma1n#1267
Could it be possible to retrieve it and get the good Keep3r ?


[11/02/2020 9:45 PM] La_ma1n#1267
Who deployed the alpha keep3r token and rugged to uniswap ?


[11/02/2020 9:45 PM] kx9x#3778
Andre did. He doesn't cater to speculators, so I reckon a 0% chance of any sort of swap.


[11/02/2020 9:45 PM] kx9x#3778
It is what it is

@kx9x  damn I’m an early supporter, it was seem legit


[11/02/2020 9:58 PM] La_ma1n#1267
It was my only eths  left to invest and couldn’t go to the new Keep3r without


[11/02/2020 9:59 PM] La_ma1n#1267
I support pretty fair and good team like dev protocol and dfohub


[11/03/2020 3:07 AM] ONI#6888
Sorry, if Andre didn't say it was the official protocol token for mainnet on his blog then it wasnt to be bought and was just for testing.


[11/03/2020 9:28 AM] La_ma1n#1267
So why he added these alpha tokens on Uniswap?


[11/03/2020 11:17 AM] kx9x#3778
Because the product integrates liquidity on Uniswap. That's one of the core concepts


[11/03/2020 11:18 AM] kx9x#3778
Did you fully read his development articles at the time?


[11/03/2020 11:26 AM] La_ma1n#1267
No, rumor of release spreads damn fast and I wanted to be early and went to fast. I swap my tellor for around 1 alpha Keep3r. What can I do with it ?


[11/03/2020 11:28 AM] La_ma1n#1267
It will remain in my collection like a souvenir to be not so dumb.


[11/03/2020 11:32 AM] La_ma1n#1267
Could you create a swap mechanism for holders of the first contract?


[11/03/2020 12:43 PM] kx9x#3778
> I wanted to be early
to dump on people who came second


[11/03/2020 12:43 PM] kx9x#3778
which is not in Andre's interest to cater to, unfortunately


[11/03/2020 12:44 PM] kx9x#3778
> Could you create a swap mechanism for holders of the first contract?
@Unknown you could make a governance proposal on the forum. wait until the voting stuff is more developed though


[11/03/2020 12:45 PM] kx9x#3778
you just have to convince all the keep3r holders to allocate some keep3r from the treasury to those who hold the test coins, which you might be hardpressed to do


[11/03/2020 12:55 PM] La_ma1n#1267
You should work with dfohub team their conctracts are reversible no need to create other contracts


[11/03/2020 1:02 PM] La_ma1n#1267
> you just have to convince all the keep3r holders to allocate some keep3r from the treasury to those who hold the test coins, which you might be hardpressed to do
@kx9x  please Keep3r holders do us this favor, we’re 154 holders feeling like on a raft drifting on the decentralise ocean.

Hi Assets to the value of $15k have been transferred from my MetaMask wallet, I saw the notification by chance on the Zerion App. My Metamask browser wallet doesnt show the transactions. My assets were staked or supplied in Yearn vaults, Uniswap and CREAM (Tx details below). Please can you have a look and advise, also what I can do from here and how it is possible?
I have been experimenting in the Defi space since August but have been investing in crypto since 2017 and understand the risks but this just seems like it was too easy to transfer my funds.
I am not programmer, I'd say I'm average computer skilled and trying to learn coding to better understand this space but still very much beginner level, I have run and checked my antivirus using Macbook and Iphone for my wallets. Have I done something wrong?
My wallet address 0x2Ad72691c6dd2332d86BFA09993f6e5eA35cAb36
If I look at etherscan I can see some of my assets in wallet 0x36e72eb60737ebb523773e610acf3b0874c6a96b In exact amounts for YFI and Farm weth

If you are looking for help it would probably be better to use etherscan link so someone that is willing to help doesn’t have to copy and paste a bunch of different strings

You were using metamask on the iphone as well?


[11/05/2020 12:28 PM] Niemand#5849

[11/05/2020 12:29 PM] Niemand#5849
is there a etherscan link on Discord?


[11/05/2020 12:30 PM] southseacompany#8897
@vany just means that you can include a link so that people can click on it to look at your account. Here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2Ad72691c6dd2332d86BFA09993f6e5eA35cAb36


[11/05/2020 12:31 PM] Niemand#5849
Ah, understood thanks


[11/05/2020 12:32 PM] southseacompany#8897
The theft happened 19 minutes after you transacted at harvest.finance so that is the most likely time that something went wrong. Unfortunately looking at etherscan doesn't really tell us anything except that someone else has the private key now.


[11/05/2020 12:34 PM] Niemand#5849
I migrated contracts on Harvest.finance prior to these funds being moved, i have also been trying to learn more about blockchain over the past month or so but very much beginner in the programming feild hence trying to figure out how I could have gone wrong.


[11/05/2020 12:36 PM] southseacompany#8897
If you haven't typed the mnemonic phrase or private key anywhere then the computer (or phone) is compromised.


[11/05/2020 12:36 PM] Niemand#5849
My concern is that it is through my PC but anti virus says everything if okay and dont want to access this wallet until I know what the cause is. I dont give out my Pvt key as this is saved in metamak and have never require it besides that hence my con fusion


[11/05/2020 12:38 PM] Niemand#5849
I see these tokens in my wallet, dont know what they are but I never put them there. How do I remove these tokens from my wallet?

[11/05/2020 12:39 PM] southseacompany#8897
They're sent for advertising purposes, i.e. they are spam. You could send them to 0x000000 to get rid of them but you'd have to pay a gas fee. So most people just let them sit there and ignore them.


[11/05/2020 12:40 PM] Niemand#5849
Also, changing the wallet is easy but what about tokens staked for 4 years in CRV and CREAM. Is it possible to move these


[11/05/2020 12:42 PM] southseacompany#8897
I don't know the cream staking contract but my guess is that they neither can be moved.


[11/05/2020 12:42 PM] southseacompany#8897
Which means that in 4 years' time there could be a race to get them out ASAP as soon as they unlock (between you and the hacker).


[11/05/2020 12:43 PM] Niemand#5849
I'm sure the hackers will find a way before my waiting time is up


[11/05/2020 12:52 PM] Niemand#5849
Are there any other sights to at least report these address, I've tried ethProtect but doesnt work. Or any contract verification sites other than Ethscan


[11/05/2020 12:55 PM] southseacompany#8897
You could maybe get etherscan to label the account as a scammer, but it won't have any practical impact. A contract cannot get the private key so checking contracts would not have prevented this.


[11/05/2020 12:59 PM] Niemand#5849
I understand and know that it is probably lost forever but as I said I am learning and will continue to follow this account as long as I can. Expensive lesson but I assume there are others out there looking into these issues and any useful resources will be appreciated as I'm sure nI wont be the last.


[11/05/2020 1:00 PM] southseacompany#8897
You should be cautious with any other credentials or important files on the computer. They may also have been accessed.


[11/05/2020 1:06 PM] Niemand#5849
I have blocked all sites until I have figure this out, This is my personal PC and dont store my info on it so not to concerned there at the moment. How my seed phrase or PVT key was leaked is what I would like to figure out.


[11/05/2020 1:07 PM] Niemand#5849
If it is the pvtkey for this wallet that was hacked does that mean all wallets are compromised on metamask, or is that only if the seed phrase was leaked.


[11/05/2020 1:07 PM] Niemand#5849
Please redirect me if this is not the correct place for this discussion


[11/05/2020 1:10 PM] southseacompany#8897
The seed phrase is basically a more friendly way to write the private key, so either is sufficient for control over a wallet.


[11/05/2020 1:11 PM] southseacompany#8897
If the other wallets on metamask are imported (e.g. with a seed phrase) then that private key has no access to them. But if you create multiple accounts on metamask they are derived from the same key so they are also compromised.

[11/05/2020 10:00 PM] fessor#6675
Late to the Niemand discussion, but is this the correct sketch of what happened?:  No hardware wallet; private key was stored on computer on Metamask; evil-doer hacked into the machine somehow and got the private key.  Also ... is it correct that that can't happen with a hardware wallet?  Hardware wallet *is* at times physically connected to the computer with a cable, but (if I understand correctly) it's impossible for a hacker to get into the hardware wallet.  I don't have a mental picture of why the hardware wallet is invulnerable.


[11/05/2020 10:03 PM] fessor#6675
Also there was a long twitter thread recently by a guy who was technically very astute, knew the risks, yet he decided to operate with a hot Metamask wallet for convenience (and it wasn't a life-changing amount of money), and he got hacked.  I believed that guy, and I believe Niemand, that they didn't get phished into typing their private key into some scammer's site, nor did their roommate or whatever find it written down somewhere.


[11/05/2020 10:08 PM] fessor#6675
Always appreciate insights into this stuff.  It's super-important, and fear of this kind of thing is what puts a ceiling on how much I'm willing to be involved.


[11/05/2020 10:10 PM] fessor#6675
A related question -- is there anything wrong with using Metamask *if* you're using it in conjunction with a hardware wallet, with all transactions' being approved on the hardware wallet?  I assume not.


[11/05/2020 11:27 PM] kx9x#3778
The hardware wallet will just sign txs. The actual key is never transferred over the wire (i.e. the usb cable)

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/05/2020 11:27 PM] kx9x#3778
basically metamask will ask the wallet to sign a tx and send the tx info over


[11/05/2020 11:27 PM] kx9x#3778
and you will verify on the hardware wallet the details of the tx


[11/05/2020 11:28 PM] kx9x#3778
and then when you hit accept, the hardware wallet will sign the tx and then send that signature over to metamask who propagates it to the Ethereum network


[11/05/2020 11:28 PM] kx9x#3778
Metamask doesn't see your private key, your computer doesn't see your private key


[11/05/2020 11:28 PM] kx9x#3778
just a TX that is signed with a signature that only your private key could ever create

Hi ! I'm looking for a guide on Yearn, how to deposit/check funds and receive tokens. I have very limited knowledge of Blockchain tech and I only hold BTC on a normie platform. I tried google a couple guides but everything seems really complex


[11/07/2020 1:36 PM] Hardisk#6372
Is there an ELI5 somewhere on all that DeFi stuff and Yearn specifically ?


[11/07/2020 4:02 PM] 0xnook#5326
@Unknown wrap your BTC into renBTC, deposit into tbtc curve pool and stake, expose yourself to the risk 4 different erc20 bitcoin versions, earn a shitload of rewards


[11/07/2020 4:03 PM] 0xnook#5326
When Keep incentives expire then you can move to yvaults


[11/07/2020 4:08 PM] 0xnook#5326
So I would recommend to buy some eth cause you will need it for transactions, download metamask and set up an ethereum wallet, then you interacting with all the different protocols is pretty self explanatory, go to yearn.finance and connect with metamask for example


[11/07/2020 5:19 PM] Hardisk#6372
@0xnook what


[11/07/2020 5:21 PM] 0xnook#5326

Oh and for my tbtc suggestion, it has the highest CRV apy for btc curve pools


[11/07/2020 5:42 PM] 0xnook#5326
+ it has some small incentives being paid out (KEEP). RIght now they are small, but the plan announced is to macht the CRV apy in KEEP in a few weeks


[11/07/2020 5:43 PM] 0xnook#5326
so imo is the best place to park btc for the time being, risks are crayzy though

Must the vote be done for rewards to be claimable? I.e. is it "your vote needs to have been cast for a vote that **finished** within the last 3 days", or is it "you need to have **voted** in the last 3 days"? I voted on 46 but rewards still not claimable, that's why I'm asking.

[11/10/2020 2:59 PM] vany#0365
Sounds like coinbase is blocking the website. You can interact with the contract to claim in etherscan

[11/10/2020 4:58 PM] kx9x#3778
you can connect web3 here and just call either getReward or exit


[11/10/2020 4:58 PM] kx9x#3778
getReward if you just want to claim, exit if you want to withdraw your YFI and claim at the same time in one tx


[11/10/2020 9:24 PM] ABONS#6707
I have noticed from last week that my staked YFI in governance are not earning rewards. No update in the Claimable Y Curve,. the number is constant. Do I need to do anything or something got changed which  I should be aware of?

[11/10/2020 10:26 PM] ted#5473
one is weekly apy one is daily. Usually it's around 6 to 10% weekly is a more accurate number than yieldfarming.info daily apy.Thats correct


[11/10/2020 10:28 PM] kx9x#3778
but one is measured in YFI and the other in yCRV


[11/10/2020 10:39 PM] ted#5473
so,if i want yfi,i would go the  yfi vault;if i want ycrv,i would go staking,but both got the same reward

[11/10/2020 10:53 PM] vany#0365

weekly is a better estimate so I would use that

It’s hard to tell if it’s a metamask issue or yearn. In #🔗links go to feel the yearn. Click on the dai vault which will take you to etherscan. Go to write contract and scroll down to withdraw all. That should be a workaround to allow you to remove your dai


[11/11/2020 2:10 PM] freshprince#8829
Great, let me try that.. thanks!


[11/11/2020 2:13 PM] freshprince#8829
Nope, same issue..


[11/11/2020 2:21 PM] rahul#9421
ive avoided withdrawing from the old yeth vault because of the withdrawal fee, will i still have to pay one now if i withdraw?


[11/11/2020 2:27 PM] vany#0365
Then it’s a metamask issue if it’s not working on etherscan.

@vany Oh ok.. but I also use coinbase wallet and it's not working  there either? (same key)

It adds up all your vault tokens uses the price for each lp token from the smart contract and converts them to usd


[11/12/2020 1:06 AM] MaximusChewy#7423
> What do you mean?
@ONI is it easy to see the LP token price on etherscan/contract?


[11/12/2020 1:24 AM] ONI#6888
I wouldn't say it's easy, but it can be done


[11/12/2020 1:24 AM] ONI#6888
I think yieldfarming.info pulls the data from the contracts themselves so it should be accurate


[11/12/2020 1:24 AM] ONI#6888
Look on the yearn vaults section


[11/12/2020 1:47 AM] kx9x#3778
>  is it easy to see the LP token price on etherscan/contract?
kinda


[11/12/2020 1:47 AM] kx9x#3778
the vault contract defines a getPricePerFullShare


[11/12/2020 1:47 AM] kx9x#3778
which is the ratio of the vault token to the deposit token


[11/12/2020 1:48 AM] kx9x#3778
converting that to USD would depend on the deposit token


[11/12/2020 1:48 AM] kx9x#3778
if that is like USDC, then super easy, just multiple by one


[11/12/2020 1:48 AM] kx9x#3778
if it is a curve lp token, then multiple by the curve contract's get_virtual_price


[11/12/2020 1:48 AM] kx9x#3778
if it is YFI, then multiply that by the YFI price


[11/12/2020 1:49 AM] kx9x#3778
e.g.
yUSD (aka yyCRV) has this getPricePerFullShare:

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734811808401063966/776307695288451082/unknown.png


[11/12/2020 1:50 AM] kx9x#3778
divide that by 1e18, cus uint256:
``` 1111537106321318584 / 1e18 = 1.11153710632```


[11/12/2020 1:50 AM] kx9x#3778
so 1 yUSD = 1.1115 yCrv


[11/12/2020 1:50 AM] kx9x#3778
then go to https://www.curve.fi/y


[11/12/2020 1:50 AM] kx9x#3778

find virtual price


[11/12/2020 1:50 AM] kx9x#3778
```1.11153710632 * 1.0597 = 1.17789587157```


[11/12/2020 1:51 AM] kx9x#3778
so yUSD is about $1.17789

I think I removed the spend limit for the yearn vault on my tokens.  If I wanted to fix that, I would need to approve the vault to spend the respective token correct?

*if I'm trying to withdraw some liquidity


[11/16/2020 9:07 PM] zai#0518
if you need to reapprove, it would prompt you. just try. i don't think so.


[11/16/2020 10:18 PM] bitznbrewz#7086
Yeah, I was getting some ludicrously high gas estimate when I tried to withdraw.   Recently had that issue with sushiswap.  Couldn't withdraw and got a massive gas estimate because I didn't remember revoking the infinite spend limit.

yeah, the master chef contract for sushi assumes you keep the infinite approval forever.  It doesn't check if it can spend everything you're trying to withdraw and just fails.

[11/17/2020 1:57 AM] nuke4u#3020
Regarding the 0.5% withdraw fee on vaults - say the amount uninvested in a strategy but in the vault is 100$, and I withdraw 101$ (therefore $1 would need to come out of the strategy). Would the 0.5% fee apply to the entire 101$ or only the $1 taken from the strategy?

Gas fees kind of high? Lower fees getting rejected..

Yeah website took $2 eth to try and allow access, then requested to do it again, and then again


[11/17/2020 8:51 AM] zbtiqua#8950

[11/17/2020 10:22 AM] Kronar#1416
@Unknown Thank you! That was very useful and it worked, my wallet connected. Now onto the next step... I've got 400 DAI that I'd like to 'earn' on. It says the transaction fee associated with that request is a bit over $400. why is the fee so high? Is it because that amount includes the DAI I am transferring to yearn? I am afraid if I approve the transaction I will loose all of my DAI. Help!


[11/17/2020 10:24 AM] Adidust#0101
I've no clue on that as im new to this myself in terms of yearn and curves but I have a bit of knowledge about wallets and such


[11/17/2020 11:10 AM] hoTCryptos#5816
I called the getreward function through etherscanbut I got nothing? Am I supposed to do anything else?


[11/17/2020 11:26 AM] hoTCryptos#5816
I'd appreciate any input as to how I can get the rewards. I didn't vote but I think it is not necessary any more to vote.

Im having trouble using metamask and my ledger together. I cant seem to withdraw my USDC from the earn section. when i try to claim it asks me to confirm my gas in metamask but doesnt ask me to confirm on my ledger and fails immediately.

I am seeing gas fees to get DAI into Earn or Vaults being very high ($300+). Is everyone else seeing this as well or is something wrong on my end?


[11/19/2020 3:29 PM] TacMan.DefiMan#6993
Can anyone help with withdrawing from Link vault? Fees are outrageous to withdraw. I can withdraw from yCRV vault and the fees are normal, but for the Link vault it costs $240.

it's an error - meaning some input must be wrong to cause that


[11/19/2020 3:34 PM] TacMan.DefiMan#6993
How do I troubleshoot it?


[11/19/2020 3:39 PM] TacMan.DefiMan#6993
It lists gas limit at 11816959. When I change that to something reasonable like 21000 I get an alert that says: Transaction Error.Exception thrown in contract code.


[11/19/2020 6:23 PM] Kronar#1416
@TacMan.DefiMan I see the same error when I adjust the gas limit too.

Anybody knows why strategy holdings in the USDT vault is going down when the vault holdings recently went up?


[11/19/2020 11:48 PM] btc#1471
Hi all, I just entered aLINK vault strategy. But I got a bit less of yaLINK tokens back to my wallet (about 5% less). Can anyone help me understand this? Does it mean I paid a 5% fee to enter the aLINK strategy? For example, I deposit 100 aLINK get 95 yaLINK back.


[11/20/2020 12:26 AM] vany#0365
<https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#:~:text=aLINK%20has%20a%200.5%25%20insurance,fee%20to%20avoid%20double%20dipping.>


[11/20/2020 12:28 AM] vany#0365
also yalink grows in value so 1 yaLINK is worth > 1 aLINK, when you convert back you will get more aLINK than yaLINK


[11/20/2020 12:35 AM] btc#1471
“Why is the yield different for aLINK and LINK vaults?
aLINK has a 0.5% insurance "fee" (this is returned when it is outperformed). LINK vault doesn't have this fee to avoid double dipping.”


[11/20/2020 12:36 AM] btc#1471
The above is from the faq page. So I paid a 0.5% insurance fee to enter aLINK strategy? @vany


[11/20/2020 12:50 AM] vany#0365
yes, and yalink is worth more than alink. that is why you see a difference in amounts


[11/20/2020 1:01 AM] btc#1471
It says this insurance fee will be returned “when it is outperformed”. I don’t understand this part. How often do we outperform? Outperform against which metric? @vany

[11/20/2020 1:32 AM] btc#1471
Ok thanks @vany a lot for the article.

Anyone knows on average how long will it take to stay in the vaults for the insurance ‘fee’ returned gradually? I mean the ‘fee’ should be returned over time on top of the apy the strategy earns, correct?

if it shows red at the bottom its an error and wont work


[11/20/2020 10:08 AM] ONI#6888
when it does this is shows a very high gas fee to alert users to not send the transaction as it wont go through anyways.


[11/20/2020 10:08 AM] ONI#6888
what vault is this? I would try clearing your cookies, trx history in mm, and logging out and back into metamask on yearn.finance


[11/20/2020 10:09 AM] FelixTS#2769
this is the DAI vault.

previous few tx's were gas limit of 420,000 or there abouts


[11/20/2020 10:12 AM] ONI#6888
I believe its due to the ypool being very low on dai


[11/20/2020 10:12 AM] ONI#6888
"Withdrawals might be subject to high slippage due to recent large withdrawal"


[11/20/2020 10:12 AM] ONI#6888
I think most people are swapping their yDAI vault lp token on snowswap for another vault token then withdrawing that


[11/20/2020 10:16 AM] FelixTS#2769
but what about depositing.....i get pretty much the same scenario


[11/20/2020 10:17 AM] FelixTS#2769
i just cleared my cookies, browsing history, reset mm, retried. same thing...

uninstalled mm, logged out of sync...restarted pc, logged in sync again, recovered mm.....
retried....same thing


[11/20/2020 10:18 AM] ONI#6888
is it just a problem with the dai vault?


[11/20/2020 10:18 AM] FelixTS#2769
seems to be for me yeah


[11/20/2020 10:23 AM] FelixTS#2769
this is right fresh after reinstalled mm, cleared all browsing cache,history and etc

I told you if it errors in red at the bottom it will do this


[11/20/2020 10:27 AM] ONI#6888
as for why, it could maybe be you dont have dai approved to send from your wallet for yearn


[11/20/2020 10:27 AM] ONI#6888
did you revoke that access somewhere


[11/20/2020 10:28 AM] ONI#6888
or it could be that slippage is too high on ypool thus the vault isnt allowing for withdrawals


[11/20/2020 10:28 AM] ONI#6888
I'm not 100% sure.


[11/20/2020 10:30 AM] FelixTS#2769
yes i am aware, trying to modifying it will result in fail out of gas on etherscan.
as for sending dai for yearn. let alone access revoking somewhere....how do i check?
but this isnt a withdrawl, this ones a deposit


[11/20/2020 10:32 AM] ONI#6888
you can check here https://revoke.cash/

@FelixTS if you interact with the contract directly and call `deposit` or `depositAll` do you get the same error?

Hi. might be a rookie question, is yBorrow.finance working as it should? I created a vault, paid a TX fee but now the screen goes blank when I try to see the vault, let alone do anything with it. The dev tools on Chrome show the error itself

Hi guys, I’m getting extremely high gas fees to remove alink from the vault. Does anyone know how to fix it, I’m sure it can’t be right? It shows 73GWEI and 11874959 gas limit and I’ve allowed yearn full permission

are you using a hardware wallet?


[11/20/2020 4:24 PM] dudesahn#2338
if so, try connecting through metamask instead

[11/20/2020 4:52 PM] dudesahn#2338
do you get the same error if you interact directly with the contract?

Ah I’m afraid I’ve never done that is it something you could run me through or send me a link on?


[11/20/2020 4:56 PM] itsurboy#4553
Ooh hang on just logged back in and gas fee is a tenth of what it was


[11/20/2020 4:57 PM] itsurboy#4553
Still pretty large but not as ridiculous, it’s 56GWEI and 1574661 limit does that sound about right?

metamask reads "

[11/21/2020 2:50 AM] ONI#6888
into the dai vault? No, but you can turn it into yUSD easily by depositing it into the ypool then into the yusd vault. You need dai to deposit into the dai vault.

if you want yUSD from USDC, you should use zapper or recycler (https://vaults.finance/)


[11/22/2020 5:20 PM] GuruG#6510
@dudesahn thankya! you mean zapper.fi right, not the zap on yearn? and if yes you mean zapper, you mean by just using the exchange function or is there a way I can zap to yUSD from a single tokens like USDC?


[11/22/2020 7:20 PM] GuruG#6510
cause vaults.finance is like $60 in gas. Wondering if it more efficient to swap for yUSD somewhere with enough liquidity


[11/23/2020 8:35 AM] caravaggio#8803
Hi guys, I'm trying to zap Dai to ycurve but getting an error each time I try saying 'there was an error calculating the transaction fee please try again' . Any ideas?


[11/23/2020 8:46 AM] caravaggio#8803
That error is coming from my coinbase wallet.


[11/23/2020 9:07 AM] Str8fish#7546
Whats the best place to find the current yUSD price?


[11/23/2020 9:07 AM] Str8fish#7546
Want to know the value of my yUSD without converting

[11/23/2020 12:36 PM] dudesahn#2338
in my experience zapping is almost always cheaper than swapping for yUSD, and recycler is actually a little more efficient than zapper I believe, although that may have changed. you can check and see what the projected cost is for each and compare


[11/23/2020 12:36 PM] dudesahn#2338
and by zapper, no, I literally mean zapping into the vault


[11/23/2020 12:37 PM] dudesahn#2338
zaps are complex functions that basically take for ETH or USDC or whatever and do all of the work for you to deposit it into the vault


[11/23/2020 1:21 PM] wellz24#4460
Sorry for the noob question, but I see .001 YFI on the Zerion app, but I am unable to claim rewards from http://ygov.rocks/stake.  What am I missing?

yes


[11/23/2020 8:33 PM] wellz24#4460
No sir.  I started messing with Yearn and CRV in May or June before the initial distribution.  If I remember correctly, if you provided LP to yearn, then you will get YFI and CRV at some point.  Is it because I never voted?  yieldfarming info used to tell me I had .001 YFI, but I can't no longer find the relevant information on the website now.


[11/23/2020 8:49 PM] dudesahn#2338
so if that's from farming, you should go to ygov.rocks -> staking -> click "v1" in the upper right corner -> select whichever pool you farmed in


[11/23/2020 8:49 PM] dudesahn#2338
probably the Y pool from your description


[11/23/2020 8:49 PM] dudesahn#2338
so then you would click on that and then "exit"


[11/23/2020 9:13 PM] wellz24#4460

Hi guys, Was trying to add some USDC into earn, but I'm not sure if I done everything needed:
- selected the value I wanted;
- clicked earn
- Authorised the transaction trough metamask 
- Transaction completed successfully
- still have 0.0 yUSDC (no USDC on my ethereum address)  

Something I'm missing here?


[11/24/2020 10:18 AM] arberx#3367
@Unknown does the deposited usdc show up on the Yearn UI?


[11/24/2020 10:20 AM] arberx#3367
You’ll have a token in your wallet that’s used to track your deposit, but is worthless.

(and the usdc is not in my address anymore)


[11/24/2020 10:47 AM] zai#0518
that is not a transaction

i mean, it is a transaction, but not a deposit


[11/24/2020 10:51 AM] Alex#6821
It's the outcome of pressing the earn button, so shouldn't it end up in yUSDC ?


[11/24/2020 10:52 AM] zai#0518
no, you gave it permission to deposit your usdc


[11/24/2020 10:52 AM] zai#0518

can someone confirm if yearn charges 0.5% on withdrawals out of yield farming protocols?


[11/24/2020 12:02 PM] zai#0518
yes


[11/24/2020 12:02 PM] zai#0518
it's complicated tho :PepeLaugh:

{Reactions}
😆 

[11/24/2020 12:08 PM] neptune888#6542
is the complicated part that they take 5% on interest profits?


[11/24/2020 12:14 PM] dudesahn#2338
no the complicated part is that the 0.5% is only applied if you're withdrawing from the strategy, but if your withdrawal amount is small enough that it's just sitting in the vault idle then there's no fee


[11/24/2020 12:14 PM] dudesahn#2338
the fee is because the withdrawal causes the strategy to need to unwind and rebalance


[11/24/2020 12:18 PM] neptune888#6542
got it, so if I were to withdraw my usdc out of yearn into usd, I would most likely be paying the 0.5% since it's out of the vault?


[11/24/2020 12:26 PM] dudesahn#2338
1. go to yearn.finance/stats
2. if the difference between the amount in the vault and the amount in the strategy is more than what you're withdrawing, you don't pay the fee. if the difference is less than what you're withdrawing, you pay the fee

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/24/2020 12:41 PM] neptune888#6542
so amount in vault has to be >2x the amount in the strategy to avoid the fee? Example if I had 201 usdc in my vault and 100 in the strategy that I want to withdraw -> 201 - 100 = 101 difference which is greater than the 100 I'm withdrawing


[11/24/2020 12:49 PM] dudesahn#2338
it's an additive difference, not a multiplicative one, but yes, the numbers in your example work


[11/24/2020 4:13 PM] neptune888#6542
thanks this is really helpful


[11/24/2020 4:14 PM] neptune888#6542
does the same 0.5% fee apply to the Earn lending aggregator?

Hi
I am trying to claim some CRV for YFI staked in the gov contract
The problem is that the new gov website ygov.rocks shows that I have a 0 balance for both YFI and rewards
If I go to the “old” ygov.finance/stake I can see my balances, but I obviously can’t claim due to the voting issue
I am using a ledger nano

Make sure you have the correct wallet connected. Ygov.rocks should work

What @vany said, but you can also claim directly in the contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x0001fb050fe7312791bf6475b96569d83f695c9f#writeContract) and call `getReward`

try using a different connection/wallet if possible, clear the cookies, reset metamask trx history, reload and reconnect to yearn.

are vault withdrawal fees expected to be high - right now if I try to withdraw from the DAI vault, metamask is showing me couple of ETH as tx fee?


[11/26/2020 5:54 AM] Wheeler#2382
I'm very new. USD Earn is on fire right now. As a new earner, should I consider putting USD into that or going with one of the vaults? I assume the prices wildly fluctuate? I'm not sure yet how to evaluate where I want to put anything.


[11/26/2020 5:55 AM] Wheeler#2382
Is there any way for me to break down why USD Coin earn is paying so much and if that seems like something likely to continue? And that must be too risky a strat for the vault not to take advantage of?

Do not stake if you want to deposit into yearn. Yearn will stake for you once you deposit into the vault

you need the 3pool LP token (aka 3crv), which you can get here: https://www.curve.fi/3pool/

I would personally recommend just zapping into the vault using zapper.fi, that way you can go straight from USDC or any other supported option -> 3pool yVault

Thanks @dudesahn but what do you think about BTC vault? At least there you also get BTC upside exposure no?


[11/29/2020 11:58 PM] Matterhorn#1591
Also gUSD looks interesting to me since it’s stable but also gives you the highest APY/most CRV tokens


[11/29/2020 11:59 PM] Matterhorn#1591
Any thoughts on those two vaults?


[11/29/2020 11:59 PM] Matterhorn#1591
I’m not sure if there’s an added benefit to 3pool since it has USDT exposure


[11/30/2020 12:04 AM] dudesahn#2338
yeah the BTC vault is good for BTC upside, GUSD is ded for now, idk if it's coming back. 3pool is good though; for stables I think any of the 3pool, Y pool, or BUSD pool are good choice but if I had to guess the best long-term yield I would say 3pool


[11/30/2020 12:09 AM] Matterhorn#1591
Got it, thanks very much! I didn’t know gUSD died, what happened? It looks like there’s a GUSD/3pool pool

@dudesahn How safe (in your opinion) is sBTC compared to something like USDT?


[11/30/2020 1:59 AM] dudesahn#2338
I would say they're both safe. People don't like the centralization risk of WBTC (which makes up part of the sBTC pool), and some people are worried about Tether FUD

[11/30/2020 2:11 AM] Matterhorn#1591
Price exposure to BTC is probably more important short term than how much CRV I can get.. I’m new to the CRV game but think it’s a worthwhile project and want to accumulate more

Hi everyone I made a small deposit to one of the vaults as test, and the withdrawal fee is about 1 ETH which is insane given that I Only deposited 69 DAI. Should I think of that money as lost? also is there any yearn product in which it would be advisable to deposit such small amounts


[12/01/2020 3:06 PM] dudesahn#2338
withdrawal fee shouldn't be 1 ETH, you're definitely encountering an error


[12/01/2020 3:06 PM] dudesahn#2338
make sure you're using metamask, make sure you didn't revoke approal, clear your cache, etc


[12/01/2020 3:30 PM] MirageLight#7241
sorry, can i check something, if i deposit my yfi into governance, there's no platform fee for withdrawing it right?


[12/01/2020 3:31 PM] dudesahn#2338
nope, no withdrawal fee for governance staking


[12/01/2020 3:31 PM] MirageLight#7241
thanks


[12/01/2020 3:54 PM] Gerardo Suarez#5871
You are right I was trying yesterday night (First time and it always said 1 ETH) today I tried and it was way lower (Do not remember but about 11$) there was somekind of mistake


[12/02/2020 8:00 AM] Operata M#4275
Hi Does anyone know if MetaMask is the only web wallet that works with Yearn? Had nothing but trouble with MetaMask- sent YFI to it and the balance is incorrect Their support team don’t care so I would rather use MEW or something else if possible Thanks


[12/02/2020 8:06 AM] ONI#6888
um


[12/02/2020 8:06 AM] ONI#6888

[12/02/2020 8:06 AM] ONI#6888

noob Q
I'v read that treasury holdings < 500k are distributed to YFI holders
https://zapper.fi/dashboard?address=0x93a62da5a14c80f265dabc077fcee437b1a0efde
shows a treasury wallet of almost 1.5m
is there something I should read on this, or is there a simple explanation?
thanks in advance!


[12/03/2020 11:27 PM] vany#0365
with v2 coming up and the adjustments voted by governance, the distribution is changing


[12/03/2020 11:29 PM] vany#0365
@Unknown that is the correct one yes


[12/03/2020 11:30 PM] adrinapp#0168
@vany thanks so much, so I just deposit in whichever of the three currencies and then get the 3crv?


[12/03/2020 11:30 PM] vany#0365
yes, once you deposit you will get 3crv, then you can go to yearn.finance and deposit into the 3pool

@vany can I withdraw anytime? your video mentions a 4 year lock in a vault


[12/03/2020 11:49 PM] vany#0365
thats for part of the crv the vault earns, you can always withdraw, just know there is a .5% withdraw fee

Hi guys, I'm just poppin in to ask a question. Why will it cost me .7 ETH about $444 dollars to withdraw my aLINK from the Chainlink Vault? Aave just released V2 and I would like to migrate soon when able. And yea, it costs almost an entire ETH to just withdraw the aLINK.


[12/04/2020 3:14 AM] Matterhorn#1591
is there any difference between depositing into sBTC curve vault in the curve protocol vs the yearn protocol?


[12/04/2020 10:37 AM] Matterhorn#1591
Anyone?


[12/04/2020 11:06 AM] vany#0365
Yearn will auto sell crv and buy more BTC for you vs at curve you have to do it manually. Also with yearn the vault is boosted so there will be more rewards vs you with zero boost

[12/04/2020 3:20 PM] ONI#6888
the contract currently cannot sell these tokens, so they are sitting there. To do so someone has to write a new contract and the devs are busy with other things, but its on their to-do list. If someone wants to do so they can.


[12/05/2020 3:07 AM] vany#0365
you want to deposit into 3pool


[12/05/2020 4:03 AM] Matterhorn#1591
does the vault save any CRV or does it sell 100% of it?


[12/05/2020 4:17 AM] vany#0365
pretty sure it stakes 10% like the other curve vaults


[12/05/2020 8:14 AM] Berg1010#4765

its based on that vault token returns


[12/06/2020 3:48 AM] ONI#6888
so you earn more of the token you put into the vault in your case this is 3pool lp tokens


[12/06/2020 4:22 AM] The Man 1953.pbrs.eth#5835

no

once deposited it will constantly earn yield for you

Hi, I bought a yinsure NFT with a certain period and the nft it gave me charged me for that amount but says a much earlier date. is this an error? if you look in the transaction I sent and decode input data you can see the period I entered which doesnt match up with what the NFT says


[12/06/2020 5:52 PM] egs5000#5000
I read the token info too and it appears the expiration is actually more than 5 months earlier than what I paid for based on the quote. the tx took about 5 or 6 mins to confirm but price didnt move 400%. why would it sell me 1/5 the time of what I entered and what the tx says at the full price?


[12/06/2020 6:21 PM] egs5000#5000
nexus tracker shows them correctly though, but the yinsure nfts are messed up for 2 policies I bought consecutively, one is slightly in my favor, but I wanted them to both be the same duration, is there a way to fix the yinsure wrapper before it expires? the underlying insurance looks correct


[12/06/2020 6:28 PM] gane#5777
My yfi coins are missing from earn vault. Link to my coinbase wallet. What happen


[12/06/2020 11:19 PM] dudesahn#2338
maybe try clearing your cache?

yeah yNFTs are bugged, you can redeem them with armor to fix everything


[12/06/2020 11:20 PM] ONI#6888
odd clear cache, refresh, reinstall metamask (make sure your seed is backed up)

I think you can swap vault dai to another vault token on snowswap


[12/08/2020 8:58 AM] ONI#6888
there is earn dai and vault dai, earn dai has v1 v2 and v3 I think

I'm having trouble connecting to the updated website with my metamask wallet.  I hit connect wallet and click metamask and nothing happens?  The "choose wallet" popup window just sits there.


[12/09/2020 11:20 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
ok.  issue seems to be with the Firefox version of metamask.  As Brave is working ok


[12/09/2020 10:48 PM] ONI#6888
ok thanks for letting us know


[12/11/2020 12:42 PM] dudesahn#2338
are you talking about v2? if so, it's got caching issues which are currently being worked on


[12/11/2020 12:49 PM] bitznbrewz#7086
Nah.  The firefox extension for Metamask got updated from version 2.16 to 2.17 and my browser didn't pick it up automatically.  I had to manually update the extension.  It was just the v1 website.

yes


[12/16/2020 7:41 PM] WillofGod#5368

[12/16/2020 7:42 PM] dudesahn#2338
did you connect your wallet?


[12/16/2020 7:42 PM] dudesahn#2338
you have to connect a wallet to see the rates


[12/16/2020 7:42 PM] WillofGod#5368
I use MetaMask and have it connected


[12/16/2020 7:43 PM] dudesahn#2338

[12/16/2020 7:47 PM] dudesahn#2338
hmm yeah sounds like it's not connecting to your wallet properly


[12/16/2020 7:48 PM] WillofGod#5368
What browser do you recommend I use. I am using Chrome at the moment


[12/16/2020 7:55 PM] dudesahn#2338
chrome should work, maybe try brave out. or just try closing your browser, clearing your cache, things like that


[12/16/2020 7:55 PM] WillofGod#5368
thank you sir. I reinstalled MetaMask. It seems the plugin did not update recently so wasn't allowing me to connect properly.

can anyone tell me if its possible to send staked yfi from one wallet to another or should it be unstaked first before sending to another wallet?


[12/17/2020 12:16 PM] dudesahn#2338
you can send yYFI to another wallet, but for staked YFI you need to unstake to transfer


[12/17/2020 12:21 PM] dudesahn#2338
yeah my gas limit is showing up as 1.5 mil


[12/17/2020 12:21 PM] dudesahn#2338
when I try to withdraw from there


[12/17/2020 12:21 PM] dudesahn#2338
seems very high


[12/17/2020 12:22 PM] dudesahn#2338
actually that's the correct amount


[12/17/2020 12:23 PM] lost#7719
so will cost $50?!


[12/17/2020 12:23 PM] lost#7719
^


[12/17/2020 12:23 PM] dudesahn#2338

[12/17/2020 12:26 PM] dudesahn#2338

[12/17/2020 12:28 PM] Gargantua#8208
Thanks @dudesahn good toknow, guess ill just keep it staked and not move it unless need since will get withdrawal fees just to do so


[12/17/2020 12:29 PM] lost#7719
Was it always this mad?!?!


[12/17/2020 12:30 PM] dudesahn#2338
yeah I just looked back to older txs, it's always used around 1mil gas for withdrawals


[12/17/2020 12:30 PM] dudesahn#2338
I think Aave's v2 aTokens are something like 4x more gas-efficient


[12/17/2020 12:30 PM] dudesahn#2338
so at least we can look forward to that

@ONI If I convert my eth to a stablecoin. Then i put the stablecoin into a yfi vault then convert it back to eth would that be worth it? Which altcoin/token/stablecoin would you choose for this?


[12/18/2020 1:27 PM] ONI#6888
there is only one YFI vault, but I'll assume you mean yearn vaults. I doubt it will be worth it, honestly, you could do so but the max you get in a year on stablecoins with yearn is maybe 30%. I bet eth goes up more than 30% in a year. That is just my opinion, but if you asking currently the comp and 3crv vault probably have the highest yields

I would try refreshing the page, clearing your cache or using private browsing, things like that

hi, how do you vote on governance v2? I have some YFI staked but every time I'm in the portal there is never an open proposal? are they few and far between?


[12/22/2020 10:56 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
there hasn't been a new item for a few weeks.  They are done via snapshot voting for the time being

Are the withdrawal costs for TUSD earn always $100 or is it just high right now?


[12/23/2020 2:06 PM] Mariodigital#9440
Is anything wrong with the USDC vault? I'm not getting any accrued interest, and it shows a  negative APY on yieldfarming.info


[12/23/2020 6:11 PM] Theremon#5876
I can't deposit or withdraw from the Dai Vault with Torus. The wallet is connected and I see the available balance but I get an error "[ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC '{"value":{"code":-32000,"message":"execution reverted"}}'" . What's wrong?


[12/23/2020 6:27 PM] dudesahn#2338
sounds like an error, I would recommend clearing your cache, restarting your browser, trying private browsing, use metamask, make sure you have enough to pay for gas, and also if you want to wait for it to be cheaper definitely wait until there's enough free TUSD in the vault so you don't have to pull from the strategy


[12/23/2020 6:28 PM] dudesahn#2338
rate's currently 10.58%; it's farming in the 3pool just fine. your amount of yUSDC should never increase, it just increases in value


[12/23/2020 6:28 PM] dudesahn#2338
not sure about this, but would recommend using metamask instead


[12/23/2020 6:53 PM] Theremon#5876
thanks @dudesahn then sorry for the noob q, but can I transfer yDAI from Torus to Metamask without withdrawing from the vault first?


[12/23/2020 7:36 PM] dudesahn#2338
yep you can


[12/23/2020 7:36 PM] dudesahn#2338
you can send them like any normal ERC-20


[12/23/2020 7:37 PM] dudesahn#2338
also, you maybe be able to recover your Torus wallet directly to metamask


[12/23/2020 7:37 PM] dudesahn#2338
export your seed phrase and import it into metamask


[12/23/2020 7:37 PM] dudesahn#2338
I know you can do that with some others like coinbase wallet


[12/23/2020 7:46 PM] Theremon#5876
ok, I think I will need to transfer. Torus doesn't have a seed phrase, it uses google auth

When i deposit into a yearn vault does my crypto make (annually) x% gains of the currency's first value original at time of deposit? Or is my profit x% of the coin's value including massive gain's in that coin's market value? Say,  if we saw a bull run.....


[12/23/2020 10:50 PM] difpiff#1030
I guess what I mean to ask is:
Does yearn take into account market functions of the crypto I deposit? Or not?


[12/23/2020 11:51 PM] rastapop#8061

It switched strategies so it messed up the calculations in apy

Oh is it not just curve y pool behind it anymore then? anywhere i can read about about the strategy change?


[12/24/2020 12:06 AM] ONI#6888
Seems like it's just deposit tusd into ypool I guess

Hi, I have an issue where I can't figure out how to see what my pending 3crv rewards are from the backscratcher vault. I have claimed previously using crv.ape.tax and received 3crv tokens but at no point could I find out how much I was going to get until I went through with the transaction. This is the case on both the crv.ape.tax site and the experimental section of yearn.finance. On the main website I can't even click "claim."  I can't tell if there is a readable function on the contract to find this info and entering my address into the different queries has not helped. 

This is frustrating because without knowing how much I have earned it is very hard to how how often to claim based on gas prices.


[12/24/2020 5:36 PM] dudesahn#2338
not sure why stats.finance is showing it like this, looks fine on yearn.finance/stats


[12/24/2020 5:36 PM] dudesahn#2338
it's always a percentage gain on the underlying asset, so price of the underlying asset is irrelevant

{Reactions}

[12/24/2020 5:37 PM] dudesahn#2338
vault holdings is total funds deposited to the vault, but for funds to be earning they need to be deployed to the strategy with an `earn` call


[12/24/2020 5:38 PM] dudesahn#2338
yeah sadly there's no way to know how much you can claim before you do it


[12/24/2020 5:38 PM] dudesahn#2338
according to sir banteg


[12/24/2020 5:55 PM] Ross 💽#2221

I tried to withdraw from the tusd vault.  The gas was 1.4X the amount I have in the vault.  Is there a glitch? Do I need to reset my computer or something in the os; browser; or wallet?


[12/27/2020 3:13 PM] Steve#3751
It was about $540. Checked another vault and the gas to withdraw was about $8


[12/27/2020 5:23 PM] Kneel#2498
Hello everyone.  I am having some trouble withdrawing funds from lending.  The funds were being used as collateral for borrowing, but I have fully paid back and show 0 borrow balance.  My attempts to withdraw 100% just burn gas with no result on a successful "Redeem Underlying" transaction.  I also tried to disable collateral on my lending balance and that also didn't seem to do anything.  Is there something else that I need to do to get this withdrawal transaction to work?  Thank you.


[12/27/2020 5:28 PM] Steve#3751
Well I guess if you can withdraw it's time to leave; any idea when the vualts I'm stuck in will have fees lower than the crypto stuck in them?


[12/27/2020 5:33 PM] Kneel#2498
I haven't tried to withdraw from a vault, only from lending, which appears not to work.  Fees are always difficult to predict with ethereum, but I don't anticipate a major drop any time soon.


[12/27/2020 5:35 PM] Steve#3751

if you need it now maybe you can snowswap to another vault then withdrawal

that is an error, i bet usually if the contract has an error it will show this instead of a proper error msg because Metamask sucks


[12/27/2020 5:41 PM] ONI#6888
its not the real fee, its just saying for some reason if you send this trx it will fail

[12/27/2020 5:45 PM] ONI#6888
like approve contact to spend tusd


[12/27/2020 7:33 PM] Steve#3751
So It cost about $30 to deposit 1 tusd into vault; I figured if I messed up a permission that would reset it. I didn't


[12/27/2020 7:34 PM] Steve#3751
think it would let me deposit but still the withdraw fee larger than what I have deposited.


[12/27/2020 7:35 PM] Steve#3751
still about $273 listed as gas fee to withdraw


[12/27/2020 7:49 PM] zai#0518
the fee doesn't depend on how much you deposit. it's the same transaction on ethereum


[12/27/2020 7:49 PM] zai#0518
273 means that there is something wrong and the transaction would fail


[12/30/2020 12:39 PM] ONI#6888
you can try revoking the ablity for it to spend tusd and reenabling it maybe


[12/31/2020 3:09 AM] Steve#3751
Didn't help $444 to move any amount of tusd out of vault

A question about using Yearn.   Let's take a Curve pool - GUSD.  On Curve, it earns 2% APY, and 40-100% in CRV rewards.   If I do the gUSD vault on Yearn, Yearn is using max boost for gUSD (2.5), so I can expect close to 100% returns on the GUSD yearn vault token (the token price would double over the year, assuming all things hold constant; they probably won't - but just for this example)? 
(side-question: Is the 2% APY included in the yvgusd3CRV price appreciation  or do I realize that when I close the position and redeem my GUSD curve tokens on Curve?).    

My main question was: for Yearn, the CRV reward gains are realized in the appreciation of the LP token whereas if I were to do this manually on Curve, I would receive the CRV rewards separate from token appreciation?


[12/31/2020 3:34 PM] ONI#6888
which token are you saying would appreciate at curve their lp token for gusd?


[12/31/2020 3:35 PM] ONI#6888
curve lp tokens do get swap fees its the first number on their chats on the home page. This is not priced into our apy numbers for vaults.

there is still no way to withdraw profit from the gov vaults if we didn t vote in a proposal?


[01/05/2021 10:06 AM] fessor#6675
What happened with the "not available" Gemini Dollar yGUSD vault?  I had a small deposit.  User interface said that if I withdrew 100%, I'd get a certain number, X, of GUSD.  I withdrew 100%, and afterward there were 0 GUSD in my wallet.  In other words, my entire investment is gone.

Hi community, does anybody knows about some diagram that shows the entire lifecycle and interactions of vaults v2 and strategies? something like a sequence diagram or any uml-like graphical explanation... I would like to deeply understand how exactly the harvest functions is called, who or which condition can throw the execution of  harvest?, how the withdrawals works regarding the limits in order to avoid affecting currently invested tokens in any strategy?

Harvest called by keepers


[01/06/2021 3:20 AM] arberx#3367
For a deeper understanding, you’ll have to look at the harvest code, and how the vault rebalances.


[01/06/2021 3:51 AM] mersothia#1562
thanks, great... about keepers, could be anyone? how are they elected? so does harvest currently require manual or human intervention?

[01/06/2021 5:45 PM] MrKey#5236
will anyone answer my question on why didn't receive my GUSD when I removed some from the vault?


[01/06/2021 6:06 PM] fessor#6675
My question, on the same day as yours, may be related.  Did you also try to withdraw from the yGUSD vault?  I withdrew from the yGUSD.  I was supposed to get some GUSD, but I got  zero GUSD.  Makes me nervous about other Yearn vaults, in which I have larger holdings.  Hope we'll get an answer.


[01/06/2021 6:48 PM] MrKey#5236
@fessor Yes I removed some and didn't get anything. This is the first time this has happened with Yern


[01/06/2021 9:05 PM] MrKey#5236
OK so now I go and look and you removed all the GUSD from my account! I still have the yGUSD but now there is no dollar value. What is going on?


[01/06/2021 9:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is decentralized they can’t just go into your account and remove GUSD... if you have the yGUSD you have a share of the GUSD vault/strategy and can use it to withdraw GUSD.


[01/06/2021 9:53 PM] MrKey#5236
@Unknown well i uses to see how much I have earned but not its not there. Also with @fessor he withdrew his GUSD anbd didn'tget anything in his wallet. If you can advise on what is going on that would be great.


[01/06/2021 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I’m pretty new to yearn so im not certain... but If you’re still seeing your yGUSD I’d guess the transaction hasn’t gone through yet (Perhaps due to high gas prices?)


[01/06/2021 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you look in #💻dev-open-chat the price per share has gone to zero so that’s why you are seeing a zero dollar value... but that’s likely just a bug in how the price per share is calculated unless something bad has happened to the vault


[01/06/2021 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah MrKey check out the dev channel for an explanation


[01/06/2021 10:48 PM] MrKey#5236
@Unknown maybe so. But my with my tranaction. I did that took a 16.12 yGUSD and didn't get anything in value. So i will see when Yern will reach out.


[01/06/2021 10:48 PM] MrKey#5236
I did take*


[01/06/2021 10:54 PM] fessor#6675
Pretty sure MrKey is correct that something went wrong with the yGUSD vault.  Days ago I made a withdrawal, and the user interface told me I'd be getting X GUSD.  After I did it, the user interface claimed/confirmed that I had withdrawn X GUSD.  But no GUSD showed up in my wallet.  (And yes, I do have GUSD entered as a custom token, so I would see it.)


[01/06/2021 10:55 PM] fessor#6675
Fortunately it wasn't a huge amount of money for me, but it has me rattled because I have more meaningful deposits in other vaults.

[01/07/2021 2:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hi - I’m new to yearn and I asked some questions in a different channel that might have perhaps been the wrong channel, so here they are again:


[01/07/2021 2:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
1). It seems like transaction fees are very high because gas is high... if I want to be part of the yyCRV vault is there any reason why I wouldn’t just buy the tokens on 1inch rather than go through curve then depositing into the vault?

2). There seem to be two options for generating profit:  I can either put my stable coins in vaults or “earn” via y.curve.fi... which is generally better and what is the difference? I thought I understood what was going on in the vaults but the presence of the y.curve.fi is kinda throwing things for a loop.

So for the yCRV vault for example, it uses yUSDC and yDai and others to provide liquidity to the curve pool. Are these yUSDC and yDai etc tokens corresponding to the y.curve.fi earn currently using AAVE? Or the USDC vault which uses the USDC3pool strategy?

3). Is there a way to find out what each of the vault strategies are doing? I’ve kind of pieced it together but would be nice to know if there’s some centralized resource for it. I can’t find anything on the forums but perhaps I’m just not looking in the right place. I’m particularly interested in some of the v2 strategies in yearn.rocks

And finally - 4) Is there a minimum amount of yfi needed to vote on governance? + can I use my yfi to vote if it’s locked in the vault?


[01/07/2021 3:35 AM] ONI#6888
1. trx are high because of high gas prices, this is just how eth works. If you buy the vault tokens else it could be subject to high slippage thus you will get a bad rate. If you deposit the correct way via curve, then deposit vault, you will get the correct rate. 

2. You can find alot of this answered in the FAQ you can find it in #🔗links or here https://docs.yearn.finance/faq earn is just automated lending to the highest provider. Vaults are automated yield farming. the yCRV aka yUSD vault yes uses earn tokens as its base curve pool. Yes they are stll getting apy and lp swap fees on curve, ontop of yield farming apy via selling the crv token the vault farms. 

3. someone was just proposing we make a document for this here https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/748476302121762866/796078580794261584 the best we have right now is https://feel-the-yearn.app/vaults which tells you its names, but not what it does. For now you can just ask in #🏦vaults for v2 strats you just need to ask. 

4. Gov is in flux right now as we are looking to move to a better system. But you have to stake in gov - ygov.rocks or in the yfi vault to be able to vote on proposals in snapshot (all votes are binding (unless it says its not binding) and going through snapshot (not on-chain voting)) no min to vote. You vote with the amount of YFI you have staked in both gov + vaults.

[01/07/2021 11:23 AM] fessor#6675
Thanks -- yes, someone there (matkam, not from Yearn team as far as I know) says that an un-named Yearn developer said there was a "bug" between the GUSD and GUSDcrv vaults, and there would be a reimbursement schedule for people that lost money.  Really a Yearn team member should be announcing something like this in the "Support" or "Announcements" channels.


[01/07/2021 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
@ONI - actually one more question. The USDC vault uses the USDC3pool strategy... but receipt tokens from that vault are not called yUSDC? (Because yUSDC corresponds to the lending protocol tokens). Correct? just a different thing altogether?


[01/07/2021 12:17 PM] Mana#0635
Hello, 
Is the second audit completed?
what are audit's results?
If 2nd audit is completed, can you update vaults to v2 and enable ETH yVault as Yearn promised 3 months ago? ...
In "Yearn - state of the vaults" it's indicated since 3 or 4 months :  "the optimization process is estimated to take an additional 1 to 3 weeks... "   :pepefarmersad:

Hi everyone - for the v2 vaults, is there a threshold of YFI you have to own in order to deposit into the vaults?


[01/07/2021 6:55 PM] ONI#6888
what do you mean by callled specifically


[01/07/2021 6:56 PM] ONI#6888
I heard it was 1 yfi decreasing over a month, not sure when the guestlist started counting it has been a few weeks I think


[01/07/2021 6:56 PM] ONI#6888
@saltyfacu any ideas?


[01/07/2021 6:57 PM] ONI#6888
for what the token is called in metamask im not 100% sure but you can refer to it as yUSDC and people will know what your saying, or yvUSDC to make it more clear


[01/07/2021 8:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
@ONI Asking in particular about the difference in how you refer to the tokens from the earn/lending and the tokens from the vault. The Earn strategy results in yUSDC, and the tokens from the vault would be yvUSDC? (As in, if I say yUSDC which one is it understood I am referring to?)


[01/07/2021 8:42 PM] ONI#6888
either you can say yUSDC to refer to both we have a naming doc somewhere

[01/07/2021 8:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also unrelated but do you have any suggestion on what vault to put USDC into? I’m considering the yCRV, BUSD, or Compound vault. Seems like the first two should be very similar in risk and returns, and the Compound one perhaps slightly less risky with slightly less returns


[01/07/2021 8:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Does that seem like an accurate characterization?


[01/07/2021 8:51 PM] ONI#6888
I put my usdc into the idle test vault


[01/07/2021 8:53 PM] ONI#6888
but of the non test vaults, I think 3crv has some of the highest apy. Also the compound vault is fully boosted so it might be a good option too.


[01/07/2021 8:54 PM] ONI#6888
returns are not related to risk in the vaults but the curve pool volume and boost it is getting from yearn


[01/07/2021 8:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I said maybe maybe more risk because you’re exposed to USDT and either TUSD or BUSD in addition to the USDC and Dai risks


[01/07/2021 8:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Does the idle test vault just move the USDC between the v1 vaults?


[01/07/2021 9:00 PM] ONI#6888
yes that would be correct


[01/07/2021 9:00 PM] ONI#6888
no v2 test vaults dont use v1 vaults. Its a strat to farm idle with usdc


[01/07/2021 9:03 PM] Deleted User#0000

Yes.. most of my recent Yearn videos touch on V2.. perhaps I should add that to the name.

But they do lack the true potential of v2 as of yet. as they are testing them with single strategies. But the vaults are V2 and can handle the added power 

<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_o4_cOevPVYC5pXs9OOexg>

here is my channel I will try to add V2 VAULT to all the titles

[01/08/2021 12:50 PM] saltyfacu#1111
It's like that. It starts counting when the vault is deployed, @crypto_navi which vault are you trying to deposit into? For example, WETH Citadel is deprecated and you won't be able to deposit


[01/08/2021 2:02 PM] crypto_navi#7883

[01/08/2021 8:18 PM] ONI#6888
y curve is just saying that these are latter used in the curve y pool, where as busd is later used in the curve busd pool, that doesnt effect where earn lends them out.


[01/08/2021 8:18 PM] ONI#6888
@Robin_


[01/08/2021 8:20 PM] Robin_#9447
it just means that if you pool money in the y pool, the assets you hold are actually earn tokens, right?


[01/08/2021 8:20 PM] ONI#6888
yes


[01/08/2021 8:20 PM] ONI#6888
the y pool base is made up of 4 earn tokens

Hello, I am trying to claim rewards on ygov.rocks.  I am getting error `ProviderError: Origin "ygov.rocks" is not on the whitelist.`  Was able to claim through etherscan so maybe not a priority with all the other interesting stuff going on.

Hi Someone knows secret network bridge for staking yfi? Have apy 30. Is sure? I'm holder.


[01/14/2021 10:28 AM] ONI#6888
what is your question? @Unknown


[01/14/2021 10:30 AM] ONI#6888
yes secret staking is live and working its roughly 17% yearly, but it only last for 6 weeks so its really like 2% (but over 6 weeks)

[01/15/2021 2:06 AM] philbert#3632
the yearn site itself does not have any QR codes, so your question seems to be more about the coinbase wallet

if im undestanding correctly


[01/15/2021 2:07 AM] philbert#3632
haven't used the coinbase wallet and i never scan QRs unless im sending it from my own wallet to another one that i own

wait rly? i click on the connect my wallet button and a qr code pops up


[01/15/2021 2:09 AM] rx#0097

Q for y all - I put ETH in the ETH vault back when it first opened. I went to check the website today and it says I have nothing in the vault. I noticed that "withdrawals" equals my deposits + earnings even though I have never withdrawn. I'm wondering: is this related to the contract optimization that's currently happening? Or is something funky up.

v1 I believe it is not on the newest update as its an older vault

never did. not quite sure how they got access tbh. i keep my seed phrase in an encrypted+passworded file on a google drive in an account with a unique pass. otherwise its....metamask

Hello, I just tried to put some DAI into earn, using metamask. The popup came up for approving the spending of DAI, and it said it would cost ETH. Approved it, and then the website never reflects changes, nor does my DAI get removed, but I am losing my ETH every time I try


[01/16/2021 2:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
There should be two transactions you need to approve


[01/16/2021 2:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
The first approves payment


[01/16/2021 2:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
The second does the actual transacting


[01/16/2021 2:14 AM] The Dream#7740
I don't think the second transaction is ever initiating


[01/16/2021 2:23 AM] The Dream#7740
Ok now I think I might be getting the second popup, but it's just wanting a gas fee that seems way too high


[01/16/2021 2:23 AM] The Dream#7740
FWIW, I am super new to this


[01/16/2021 2:26 AM] The Dream#7740
Looks like I was able to interact w/ a vault with no issues, just earn is giving me problems


[01/16/2021 2:41 AM] daramir#1305
Thanks ONI. Do you mean it's not planned to get an update to aave v2 in the next yearn? Otherwise what would be your recommendation for having exposure to LINK on yearn?


[01/16/2021 3:46 AM] ONI#6888
I think it will be upgrade to a v2 vault and use the newest version of aave is my guess

Hi all - I have some ETH in my Metamask wallet. How do I transfer this into DAI? Do I have to do that swap directly within Metamask? Like like it will cost ~$24 to do that lol


[01/16/2021 12:38 PM] philbert#3632
you can go to app.uniswap.org or sushiswap.fi for lower pricing


[01/16/2021 12:39 PM] philbert#3632
make sure you keep eth in your wallet always because you'll need it if you ever want to swap back


[01/16/2021 12:39 PM] philbert#3632
but yeah, gas cost will still prob be around $20 on those sites, I think metamask just takes a bigger fee or something


[01/16/2021 12:40 PM] willgdjones#3800
Ok thanks, How much ETH should I keep on my wallet?


[01/16/2021 12:51 PM] willgdjones#3800
Gas fees are high! Any way I can buy DAI directly?


[01/16/2021 12:51 PM] willgdjones#3800
In order to bypass those fees


[01/16/2021 12:51 PM] ONI#6888
buy on an exchange?


[01/16/2021 12:52 PM] willgdjones#3800
Yes... 😄


[01/16/2021 12:54 PM] willgdjones#3800
So is there any benefit to transferring between currencies on decentralised exchanges? Seems like it's just a fast way to lose money, and it is better to buy direct


[01/16/2021 12:54 PM] philbert#3632
if you do it through metamask there's no KYC


[01/16/2021 12:55 PM] philbert#3632
all permissionless and decentralized


[01/16/2021 12:55 PM] philbert#3632
only benefit really, also there's activities you can do when your money is in defi


[01/16/2021 12:55 PM] philbert#3632
rather than on an exchange


[01/16/2021 12:56 PM] willgdjones#3800
Ok - so if I have DAI on Kraken, can I easily and cheaply send this to my Metamask wallet? Or do I still need to pay gas fees?


[01/16/2021 12:57 PM] ONI#6888
you need to pay gas to do anything on ethereum


[01/16/2021 12:57 PM] ONI#6888
it should be expenisve, but typically cexs charge a few dollars to withdrawal


[01/16/2021 12:57 PM] willgdjones#3800
should or shouldn't?


[01/16/2021 12:58 PM] philbert#3632
yeah, you can send it for cheap to metamask but once it's on there, everything starts costing gas


[01/16/2021 12:58 PM] philbert#3632
id read up more before doing anything


[01/16/2021 12:58 PM] ONI#6888
it depends what you want to do


[01/16/2021 12:58 PM] philbert#3632
so you don't waste money


[01/16/2021 12:58 PM] ONI#6888
and how much you have


[01/16/2021 12:58 PM] ONI#6888
if you have under 1k its probably not worth it to farm anything in defi


[01/16/2021 12:59 PM] willgdjones#3800

Would this transaction chain make any sense at all...

EXCHANGE EUR on Kraken for YFI
TRANSFER YFI from Kraken to Metamask
FARM YFI to achieve yield
TRANSFER YFI from Metamask to Kraken
EXCHANGE YFI for EUR on Kraken

Or would this always lose money? Seems like it would need to pay gas fees twice.


[01/16/2021 3:39 PM] willgdjones#3800
But, if the yield is high enough, then it might make sense. Just tell me if I'm smoking crack and if this makes NO sense!


[01/16/2021 4:01 PM] willgdjones#3800
It definitely seems WAY more expensive to use a DEX vs a CEX. Is that wrong?


[01/16/2021 4:24 PM] Spiggy#9366
Hi, I was just wondering if you put your stablecoins into the standard "Earn" page you have to pay etherium gas fees when your coins are moved around? Yearn just sounds too good to be true so I was wondering if this was the catch.


[01/16/2021 4:43 PM] Matterhorn#1591
@Unknown if they are moved by the protocol after you deposit, you are not paying for that gas


[01/16/2021 4:43 PM] Matterhorn#1591
the gas fee is shared pro rata by everyone in the pool


[01/16/2021 4:44 PM] Matterhorn#1591
so if it's $100 to move the USDC in Earn from Aave to dydx, then everyone in the pool shares a small fraction of the $100 gas fee


[01/16/2021 4:44 PM] Matterhorn#1591
if you make up 1% of the pool your gas cost would be $1, but you do pay gas when you join or exit the pool


[01/16/2021 5:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Farming yfi doesn’t make much sense at the moment.. the returns are low.


[01/16/2021 5:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you’re farming in one of the other pools then yeah it might make sense


[01/16/2021 5:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Depends on how long you want to to keep the coins in the vault


[01/16/2021 5:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
And what quantity you are doing


[01/16/2021 5:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Gas fees are constant cost


[01/16/2021 6:03 PM] willgdjones#3800
Like which protocol? And how can you tell?


[01/16/2021 6:04 PM] willgdjones#3800
Seems like most of the action happening at the moment is with holding coins rather than using the coins for activity 🙂


[01/16/2021 6:04 PM] willgdjones#3800

Hello all. I have some aLINK on my Ledger Nano X but when I go to https://yearn.finance/vaults it says that I have 0 aLINK available to deposit. I know that yearn has a problem connecting directly with Ledgers so I imported it into MetaMask. I've used the Y LP vault so I know that my wallet works on the site. Also, I'm allowing contract data in tx's. Can anyone help? Thanks


[01/17/2021 12:41 PM] ONI#6888
at the time the vote was created did you have yfi staked in gov or the yfi vault?


[01/17/2021 12:42 PM] ONI#6888
is it the new alink or old alink?


[01/17/2021 12:42 PM] ONI#6888
this is a v1 vault and on the older verions


[01/17/2021 12:42 PM] ONI#6888
I think you might have v2 alink? Not sure what its called.


[01/17/2021 12:43 PM] prevail#0959
Oh. You're probably right. I'm guessing there's no vault for the v2 aLINK?


[01/17/2021 12:45 PM] ONI#6888
should be soon!


[01/17/2021 12:45 PM] ONI#6888
v2 is around the corner, and upgraded v1 vaults to v2 vaults of the same kind will follow quickly


[01/17/2021 12:47 PM] prevail#0959
OK. Thanks a lot. I was getting a little annoyed. I guess I have to wait on the new vault. Cool


[01/17/2021 12:58 PM] ONI#6888

[01/17/2021 10:28 PM] tmwsiy#5135
Hi! I am a bit confused. I had some aLINK from aave v1 and it showed 0 on the vault so I thought ok I will go to v2 and I did and it still shows 0. Can anyone please tell me what I am doing wrong?


[01/17/2021 10:36 PM] ONI#6888
@dudesahn


[01/17/2021 11:25 PM] dudesahn#2338
there is no v2 aLINK vault


[01/17/2021 11:26 PM] tmwsiy#5135
it was 0 on v1 too


[01/17/2021 11:26 PM] dudesahn#2338
hmmm


[01/17/2021 11:27 PM] dudesahn#2338
I would make sure your wallet is connected (the one with aLINK in it), clear cache, try private browsing, restart your browser, etc


[01/17/2021 11:27 PM] tmwsiy#5135
yeah other coins show up though


[01/17/2021 11:28 PM] tmwsiy#5135
I should have asked before I moved


[01/17/2021 11:30 PM] tmwsiy#5135
I guess it is pointless if you are just going to assume user erropr


[01/17/2021 11:30 PM] tmwsiy#5135
thanks for the response


[01/17/2021 11:30 PM] dudesahn#2338
I mean, there's no reason why it shouldn't be working


[01/17/2021 11:31 PM] dudesahn#2338
so you had v1 aLINK, it didn't show up, so you bought v2 aLINK?


[01/17/2021 11:31 PM] tmwsiy#5135
worse  I withdrew my v1 and deposited in v2


[01/17/2021 11:32 PM] dudesahn#2338
someone just deposited 38 mins ago to the vault, so it's working


[01/17/2021 11:34 PM] tmwsiy#5135
Can you be sure that it was done through the dapp?


[01/17/2021 11:34 PM] tmwsiy#5135
It is ok sorry to be a pest I will go away


[01/17/2021 11:38 PM] dudesahn#2338
yeah I mean it sounds like a weird error, idk why it's seeing all of your other tokens and not aLINK, wish I had better advice


[01/18/2021 6:52 AM] klein592#1754

there is no way on the website to know, might be able to ask in #📈speculation to see if someone else who has claimed their 3crv can give you an estimate

yusd is the only yearn token that is used as collateral right now at places like cream or in a sushi LP pool


[01/18/2021 11:22 PM] vany#0365

Hello, read yearn’s Manifesto. Got some Dai, halted a Uniswap Liquidity Pool contribution 😬, and put it all into a yDai Vault. Went to yearn.party, but coinbase wallet wasn’t available. But it is available at v2.yearn.finance. Question is: when will yearn.party gain coinbase support? Thanks for any assistance you can provide, excited to join the community.


[01/19/2021 3:10 AM] dannydigtl#2510

you can ask about it in the vault channel and the strat creators might answer they would know.

[01/19/2021 5:58 PM] dudesahn#2338
probably your best best would be to zap yUSD -> USDC and then use curve to swap USDC -> sUSD

I have an issue with Zapper and the aLink vault. I used zapper to deposit an amount of link to the aLink vault. It was succesful in converting my Link into the equivalent amount of aLink, and then when the aLink was deposited to the vault it gave me a lesser value in yaLink, even factoring in the difference in value of yaLink and aLink. Can someone help me with understanding this?


[01/19/2021 11:35 PM] ONI#6888
this should be it converting you amount to the shareprice. Its normal to get less than what you have in link


[01/19/2021 11:35 PM] ONI#6888
because the shareprice is greater than 1


[01/19/2021 11:36 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
I know the value of yaLink is roughly 1.057 aLink, but when I try to withdraw, the amount of Link withdrawable is still less than the amount of link I put in


[01/19/2021 11:36 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
I have factored that share price difference in already, and I'm still light a significant amount accounting for that.


[01/19/2021 11:37 PM] ONI#6888
"aLINK has a 0.5% insurance "fee" (this is returned when it is outperformed). LINK vault doesn't have this fee to avoid double dipping."

that makes sense

thanks for explaining

mystery explained


[01/19/2021 11:38 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
but Link vault does not currently accept depsoits no?


[01/19/2021 11:38 PM] ONI#6888
yes that is correct


[01/19/2021 11:38 PM] ONI#6888
basically link is just a passthrough for alink


[01/19/2021 11:38 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
well that explains eveything, that is roughly the missing amount


[01/19/2021 11:38 PM] ONI#6888
alink deposits to link


[01/19/2021 11:38 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
how will I know if it has outperformed and the .5% can be returned?


[01/19/2021 11:39 PM] dudesahn#2338
basically you can check and see the last time someone called a function...I think it's something like `claimInsurance` or something


[01/19/2021 11:40 PM] dudesahn#2338
but if that has been called after you deposit then you have been paid back the 0.5%


[01/19/2021 11:41 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
Hmmm not sure how to do that. How often on average is it called?


[01/19/2021 11:41 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
So I can ballpark estimate


[01/19/2021 11:42 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
Or can you send a link to where I can check claim insurance


[01/19/2021 11:42 PM] dudesahn#2338
so tbh I don't know how to check it


[01/19/2021 11:42 PM] dudesahn#2338
you basically need to watch the events


[01/19/2021 11:43 PM] dudesahn#2338
emitted from the contract, or each transaction


[01/19/2021 11:43 PM] dudesahn#2338
there was someone who was doing that


[01/19/2021 11:43 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
So if I leave it in for 2 months you think it would have called by then?


[01/19/2021 11:43 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
or is it called on a less frequent basis, on average


[01/19/2021 11:43 PM] dudesahn#2338
it should've been called probably


[01/19/2021 11:43 PM] dudesahn#2338
the user transferAndCall posted about it over in the #🏦vaults  channel


[01/19/2021 11:44 PM] dudesahn#2338
he's the one who was tracking it


[01/19/2021 11:44 PM] Stephen94k🍃#1847
gottcha, I'll probably leave it in there until link staking comes out, so probably a long while


[01/19/2021 11:44 PM] dudesahn#2338
you can head over there and look through messages, just search "claimInsurance"

I’m interested in least risky stablecoin yield.. so I believe earn.. in v1 the tab defaults to y.curve.fi. Is this depositing in curve pools? I thought earn was only earning interest in Compound. Thanks

no it doesnt

[01/22/2021 11:11 PM] ONI#6888
yes its earning interest if you deposited. You dont see the interest as more ydai but in the price appreciation of ydai tokens. tldr everything is working fine, but your token balance will not increase.


[01/22/2021 11:11 PM] ONI#6888
you might be able to view earn dai tokens on zapper.fi to see their value increase over time


[01/22/2021 11:13 PM] Williono#1991
Do do you mean I wont see an increase in yDAI,  but i will see the convert rate (yDAI -> DAI) increase overtime, therefore getting earining from there?


[01/22/2021 11:13 PM] ONI#6888
yes


[01/22/2021 11:13 PM] ONI#6888
your yield goes into an increase in yDAI (earn) Price


[01/22/2021 11:13 PM] ONI#6888
not more yDAI (earn) tokens


[01/22/2021 11:13 PM] Williono#1991
Is there a place I can track this price?

[01/22/2021 11:14 PM] ONI#6888
also note


[01/22/2021 11:14 PM] ONI#6888
it will flucuate as dai price goes up and down


[01/22/2021 11:14 PM] ONI#6888
that is seperate from yDAI price appriciation


[01/22/2021 11:14 PM] ONI#6888
so one day it might seem like your tokens dropped in value, but that is because the peg dropped lower

is this you?


[01/23/2021 11:26 PM] Quiver#5965
If so its 279.lots of numbers


[01/23/2021 11:26 PM] DeAblo#2155
yes


[01/23/2021 11:26 PM] Quiver#5965
yeah thats fine then. It's just the dev fee on the vault


[01/23/2021 11:26 PM] Quiver#5965
they didnt give you too much


[01/23/2021 11:26 PM] Quiver#5965
dont worry


[01/23/2021 11:26 PM] Quiver#5965
279. something


[01/23/2021 11:26 PM] Quiver#5965
but a big fraction


[01/23/2021 11:27 PM] DeAblo#2155
okay thanks. Much appreciated.


[01/23/2021 11:27 PM] DeAblo#2155
it shows as 279,791,879,037,801,096,011 YVDAI


[01/23/2021 11:28 PM] Quiver#5965
It's a decimal after 279. in your wallet tho 🙂


[01/23/2021 11:28 PM] Quiver#5965
likely visual bug


[01/23/2021 11:29 PM] DeAblo#2155
Okay good. Being a newbie and seeing that was confusing. Thanks again for the clarification.


[01/23/2021 11:29 PM] Quiver#5965
No problem at all

your first deposit requires 2 transactions:
- confirmation
- DAI deposit

[01/24/2021 2:12 AM] vany#0365
i was getting a white screen on the homepage but was able to get the site to work going to the vaults page


[01/24/2021 2:14 AM] The Man 1953.pbrs.eth#5835
hmm well I use coinbase and when I connect it all I can see is the wording at the top


[01/24/2021 2:15 AM] vany#0365
are you trying to access a v1 vault? you can use the v1 website link in #🔗links if so


[01/24/2021 2:22 AM] The Man 1953.pbrs.eth#5835
well that right there is the problem thanks

Hello, what can I do with my YFI ?


[01/24/2021 2:40 AM] KaRLiToS#3687
Stake in a vault? Pair it?


[01/24/2021 2:43 AM] ONI#6888
you can lp in bancor, earn interest on secret network, stake in gov, but that will probably be going away soon


[01/24/2021 2:45 AM] KaRLiToS#3687
Can I stake in the vault or not the best way to use it?

[01/24/2021 2:45 AM] KaRLiToS#3687
is it profitable?


[01/24/2021 2:45 AM] ONI#6888
when a new strategy comes out it will switch to that from gov


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] ONI#6888
as of right now no


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] KaRLiToS#3687
ok


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] ONI#6888
i mean


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] ONI#6888
yes its profitable


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] ONI#6888
but the apy is low


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] KaRLiToS#3687
but only 1.3%


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] ONI#6888
we are working on a new strategy for it


[01/24/2021 2:46 AM] KaRLiToS#3687
yeah ok, thanks for the help my friend. i'm trying to find a good use of it cause I'm gonna hold long time


[01/24/2021 2:47 AM] ONI#6888
then the vault is a good use


[01/24/2021 2:47 AM] ONI#6888
or if you can get into the bancor pool that is good apy to let it sit


[01/24/2021 2:55 AM] KaRLiToS#3687
This?

try accessing from zapper.fi, <https://zapper.fi/invest>


[01/24/2021 8:25 PM] vany#0365
search aLINK and you should be able to interact with the vault there

well, rip on gas ig


[01/24/2021 9:05 PM] rx#0097
i only have a 100 in there so ig i'll keep it there forever until gas prices go down haha


[01/24/2021 9:05 PM] vany#0365
thats probably best, the difference in apy will not make up for the gas fees you pay with on $100 in there

Any better staking for YFI these days?


[01/25/2021 8:49 PM] vany#0365
yeah its dropped off to around 1-2% and its also just getting removed due to the recent YIP passing where the fees are getting reinvested into the protocol


[01/25/2021 8:50 PM] vany#0365
you can deposit in Maker, Aave, or Cream. You could also LP with Uni or Sushi

Hi all where can I read the advantages of v2? Will there an automatic migration at some point? I have some tokes staked and I wonder if I should unstake from v1 and re-stake in v2


[01/26/2021 5:22 AM] tshawnh#4704
Was going to move my DAI from v1 to v2 vault, but I don't see an estimated APY for v2 in the new UI . Does it not show until you deposit? Would be nice to see what it is beforehand to see if it's worth bothering. Are fees (withdraw and deposit) still being waived for moving from v1 to v2 vaults?


[01/26/2021 4:01 PM] ONI#6888
try crtl+shift+r it says 14.87% for me


[01/26/2021 4:02 PM] ONI#6888
afaik there will never be an auto migration. You will have to move manually


[01/26/2021 4:04 PM] tshawnh#4704
Went back to the site later in the day, and boom - APY values were then showing up, so all good there now. Are fees still being waived for migrating from v1 to v2?


[01/26/2021 4:05 PM] ONI#6888
yes all v1 vaults that have a production v2 vault have their fees waived

Hey, I'm having an issue removing liquidity from the lending section on v1.  I tried to withdraw all of my collateral with a borrow balance of $0 and I still see that I'm supplying the same amount of liquidity.  So I tried to undo the collateral slider and it still shows checked when I reloaded the page


[01/26/2021 9:39 PM] bitznbrewz#7086
oh it looks like it didn't remove all of my Borrow balance even though I hit 100%?  How do you cleanly exit and remove 100% of the balance


[01/26/2021 10:01 PM] dskip#3097
Why isn't my ydai accumulating on yearn earn v1


[01/26/2021 10:01 PM] dskip#3097
I feel like it hasn't moved at all


[01/26/2021 10:03 PM] dskip#3097
I only have a 3 figure amount of dai but it's been in there for about 3 weeks and i haven't seen anything move. The ydai number stays the same and the Dai number goes up and down but mostly hovers


[01/26/2021 10:04 PM] bitznbrewz#7086
your ydai won't accumulate


[01/26/2021 10:04 PM] bitznbrewz#7086
the underlying dai amount goes up


[01/26/2021 10:05 PM] dskip#3097
Oh ok that answers my question. It's such a minimal amount i can see why it would fluctuate and hover at the same time


[01/26/2021 10:05 PM] dskip#3097

What am i missing??


[01/26/2021 10:07 PM] bitznbrewz#7086
the fee structure is different between v1 and v2.  v2 was a total rework of the underlying vaults to allow for some different and varied strategies.  I'm less equipped to answer that question

yea 

[01/27/2021 1:33 AM] ONI#6888
You can check how much yield your vault accounts are making at https://yvault-roi.netlify.app/ or Zapper.fi. A note that the amount of vault tokens you have will not increase unless you deposit more of that vaults coin into the vault, but the price of the vault tokens you hold, yusd for example will increase daily. That is your yield. Check the usd balance of your vault accounts on zapper, and it will increase over time. On withdrawal, you burn the ytoken you obtained to get back your deposit + interests earned - 0.5% withdraw fee for v1 or in v2 there is no withdraw fee and just the 2/20 fee that comes out at harvest https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#what-are-the-fees

annnd it works now


[01/27/2021 7:15 PM] beebo#4660
Can i vote with my yfi staked in the vault?
Or does it need to be in governance


[01/27/2021 7:49 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
either the yyfi vault or regular governance vault will work

not a noob question, it definitely will be updated once the docs team has time to do so 😅


[01/28/2021 12:59 AM] dudesahn#2338
we're actively looking for several UI/UX/web dev positions, check trach's tweet in #📣announcements


[01/28/2021 1:00 AM] dudesahn#2338
did you ever get this resolved?


[01/28/2021 1:01 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
uhhhhhhhh yes, but not in a good way lol.  I basically had to hit Repay 100% three times and commit the 3 transactions before it worked


[01/28/2021 1:02 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
ultimately was verifying that I had a zero borrowed balance via the Etherscan contract


[01/28/2021 1:04 AM] dudesahn#2338
wait no I responded to your yveCRV question


[01/28/2021 1:04 AM] dudesahn#2338
you said you couldn't claim your rewards after sending to another address


[01/28/2021 1:05 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


[01/28/2021 1:05 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
haha


[01/28/2021 1:05 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
i had an issue with the lending protocol as well


[01/28/2021 1:08 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
So, from the original address, I see that I have CRV claimable from gauges, but i no longer see any claimable 3Crv rewards


[01/28/2021 1:09 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
and the new address with the non-zero vault balance also has a 0 claimable 3Crv rewards


[01/28/2021 1:09 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
its a _small_ amount, but it had a nonzero value before I transferred out


[01/28/2021 1:09 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
non-zero rewards value


[01/28/2021 1:21 AM] dudesahn#2338
you can't claim if you go to crv.ape.tax?


[01/28/2021 1:22 AM] bitznbrewz#7086

[01/28/2021 1:23 AM] dudesahn#2338
@banteg or @kx9x any ideas here?


[01/28/2021 1:23 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
I know this would accrue rewards v slowly.  but I deposited back before banteg made a UI for it when it was just the etherscan contract


[01/28/2021 1:23 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
so i know I had _some_ rewards available between then and now


[01/28/2021 1:23 AM] dudesahn#2338
when did you do the transfer?


[01/28/2021 1:23 AM] dudesahn#2338
like how long had it been sitting in the first address?


[01/28/2021 1:24 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
one moment


[01/28/2021 1:24 AM] ONI#6888
send it back and try to claim?


[01/28/2021 1:25 AM] ONI#6888
Seems like a flaw in the vault maybe banteg can fix it

yeah no worries.  appreciate the help


[01/28/2021 1:35 AM] dudesahn#2338
this is some weird shit


[01/28/2021 1:36 AM] dudesahn#2338
my only other suggestion would be trying a hard refresh (shift + cmd + r), clearing your cache or doing private browsing


[01/28/2021 1:36 AM] bitznbrewz#7086
yeah i did try that too


[01/28/2021 2:38 AM] jessica#5184
can anyone teach me the ytoken balance method for "earn"? is it the ratio of ytoken to token that changes as the deposit gains interest or is it the value of ytoken that increases as the deposit gains interest? ex) ytoken : token -> 1:1 at the time of deposit --> 1:1.5 at the time of withdrawal to reflect interest // OR // 100 yTokens are given when deposit 100 Tokens at the time of deposit --> the number of yToken increases and 150 yTokens are there to reflect the interest at the time of withdrawal

v1? v2? vaults? which one is which?


[01/28/2021 2:22 PM] buckminster#9579
When trying to deposit into a vault for the first time I ran into some issues. I'm trying to deposit into the DAI v2 vault.  I clicked deposit and accepted via metamask. On metamask activity it says "aprove dia spend limit".  On etherscan it says the transaction was a success.  But the  DAI is still in my metamask account, yearn does not show that there is any DAI deposited in the vault, and it is still reading as the same amount is available to deposit.  It appears I paid the gas but the DAI did not move.  Is this normal?  I'm being extra cautious as a noob.  Thanks.


[01/28/2021 2:35 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
I think there is 2 transaction.  first is an approve to spend when spending something for the first time on a site and you need another to actually deposit


[01/28/2021 3:08 PM] buckminster#9579
Thank you.  I think you are correct.  Because when I try a second time, I get a much higher gas price than the first time, so now I truly understand the crazy gas folks are complaining about.  First only costed like 4 usd, now it wants 70+


[01/28/2021 3:09 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
first one is the approve which is a much cheaper tx.  The deposit one will be more for sure.  70 seems high, but I would have guessed 30-40 at min


[01/28/2021 3:16 PM] buckminster#9579
Yes, actually its 13$.  The 70 was from zapper dai to curveUSDN.  Same amount of DAI too, much different gas prices.  thanks again, I'm looking forward to getting over this learning curve no pun.

trying to vote via snapshot page, but YFI amount showing as 0 when i press vote button? is there a bug ?


[01/28/2021 4:20 PM] vany#0365
was your YFI staking in yGOV or yYFI vault?


[01/28/2021 4:23 PM] CCIEBRYAN#4476
not currently staking - does it need to be staking first ?


[01/28/2021 4:26 PM] CCIEBRYAN#4476
Just staked in yGOV and will try again.


[01/28/2021 4:32 PM] CCIEBRYAN#4476
Yfi staked in Ygov


[01/28/2021 4:33 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
it needed to be staked prior to the snapshot block deadline


[01/28/2021 4:34 PM] CCIEBRYAN#4476
oh right didn't realise the deadline had passed


[01/28/2021 4:35 PM] CCIEBRYAN#4476

Hi guys ! I'm having a trouble voting on https://snapshot.vote/#/yearn/proposal/QmX8oYTSkaXSARYZn7RuQzUufW9bVVQtwJ3zxurWrquS9a but just for the Yearn space. It Shows I have 0 YFI although I have a bit more (O.025) I assumed it was this interface truncating it because it's bellow 0.1. But When I vote, it says my vote is in but I can't see it.
I can vote on other projects and it works perfectly.


[01/29/2021 10:31 AM] Mélen#4878
I have tried Brave, Firefox, IPFS Companion ON/OFF. I'm using a Ledger through metamask, on macOS and I has the YFI at the moment of the Snapshot


[01/29/2021 10:33 AM] Mélen#4878
do people that have sub 0.1 amount of YFI have their amount shown here ?

[01/29/2021 10:34 AM] ONI#6888
was your yfi staked in ygov or the yfi vault before the snapshot went live?


[01/29/2021 10:34 AM] Mélen#4878
No, it's on my wallet just as 'pure' token


[01/29/2021 10:34 AM] ONI#6888
then you cannot vote


[01/29/2021 10:34 AM] ONI#6888
you have to have it staked in governance to vote


[01/29/2021 10:35 AM] Mélen#4878
But the snapshot says it accepts YFI, yYFI and YFI delegated, doesn't it counts ?


[01/29/2021 10:35 AM] ONI#6888
no it doesnt count


[01/29/2021 10:35 AM] Mélen#4878
ahhhhhh, my bad then…


[01/29/2021 10:35 AM] ONI#6888
you have to be staked in ygov.rocks or the yfi vault


[01/29/2021 10:36 AM] Mélen#4878
ok, shit sucks for me, anyways I wasn't going to make such a change, but it's cool to vote on things like this. I'll know it for the next time 😉


[01/29/2021 10:36 AM] ONI#6888

well governance will probably be redone soon, but you can stake at ygov.rocks

Hi is there someone that can help me? I was charged ETH but my USDC coin was never converted to busd curv... additionally, it charged my eth... around 5 bucks... then prompted me to pay like 1k in gas fees after paying a lower gas fee


[01/29/2021 9:57 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
I can share a snapshot, it's very disconcerting


[01/29/2021 9:57 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
can share trnsxns w/ wallet... basically paid around 20 bucks in eth for gas fees for nothing

you approved the protocol for spending your USDC, but you never deposited anything


[01/29/2021 11:02 PM] zai#0518
also, don't use zap


[01/29/2021 11:02 PM] zai#0518
it's not ready for consumption by normal people


[01/29/2021 11:02 PM] zai#0518
the exorbitant fee is how you know that you were requesting an invalid transaction


[01/29/2021 11:03 PM] zai#0518
@Unknown


[01/29/2021 11:13 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
so basically, approve the transaction, then click the deposit button?


[01/29/2021 11:13 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
this will be my third time trying this!!!


[01/29/2021 11:14 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
also, how would I go about getting tokens for that vault pool then? The returns look TASTY


[01/29/2021 11:15 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i don't see a deposit button, just an "earn button"


[01/29/2021 11:15 PM] zai#0518
you need to get them from curve


[01/29/2021 11:15 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
"earn" button


[01/29/2021 11:15 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
ii'm going into the normal earn tool under y.curve.fi


[01/29/2021 11:15 PM] zai#0518
also, you are not in the right interface, you are trying to use zap


[01/29/2021 11:15 PM] zai#0518
yeah, no, you need to go to the vaults page


[01/29/2021 11:15 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
even there, i still get the same message projmpting for 1.12 ether


[01/29/2021 11:16 PM] zai#0518
and you need to have proper tokens from Curve to deposit


[01/29/2021 11:16 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i can't just deposit usd coin?


[01/29/2021 11:16 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
it looks like i can


[01/29/2021 11:16 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i have 95.00 in usd to run a test


[01/29/2021 11:17 PM] zai#0518
only in the USDC vault, not in BUSD


[01/29/2021 11:17 PM] zai#0518
you need matching token for every vault


[01/29/2021 11:17 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
yes that much is clear


[01/29/2021 11:18 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
is there a way for me to avoid the gas fee since i paid it!?


[01/29/2021 11:18 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
it's such a bummer i'm going to have spent like $25 just to have learned to press deposit


[01/29/2021 11:18 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i feel like a fool


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] zai#0518
there is no way, we are on the blockchain :hug:


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] zai#0518
code is law


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] zai#0518
you have to pay gas for every action


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
if for example


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i considered a large amount


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
like 50k


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
would the gas be the same price?


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
ish?


[01/29/2021 11:19 PM] zai#0518
yes


[01/29/2021 11:20 PM] zai#0518
same transaction, same price


[01/29/2021 11:20 PM] zai#0518
regardless of amount


[01/29/2021 11:20 PM] corbeezyjd#0364

you can deposit any of the coins this pool accepts, and it will give you the token in return

you will get rekt by slippage, it's not optimized

roughly how much % is charged by slippage

you need to wait for the transaction to be mined

[01/29/2021 11:24 PM] zai#0518
only then can you deposit


[01/29/2021 11:24 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
if you check my wallet you will see i was just charged tho


[01/29/2021 11:24 PM] zai#0518
you need to watch a YouTube video on how ehtereum works


[01/29/2021 11:24 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
okay


[01/29/2021 11:24 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i guess i need to add another 25 dollars or so to ethereum to complete the trnsxn


[01/29/2021 11:24 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
is that correct?


[01/29/2021 11:24 PM] zai#0518
no, you already paid


[01/29/2021 11:25 PM] zai#0518
you are waiting


[01/29/2021 11:25 PM] zai#0518
look in metamask under activity


[01/29/2021 11:25 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
but it says alert: insufficient funds


[01/29/2021 11:25 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
in metamask it says status: confirmed


[01/29/2021 11:25 PM] zai#0518
because you are trying an invalid transaction


[01/29/2021 11:25 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
or b/c i don't own much eth


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
but i had enough


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i am under vaults


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
trying to depoist USD coin


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
which i have 95.000 of


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i can send a snapshot


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] zai#0518
if your approval transaction confirmed, yes, now you need to pay for the deposit. in ETH


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] zai#0518
if you don't have enough it will give you an error


[01/29/2021 11:26 PM] zai#0518
depositing into curve is expensive


[01/29/2021 11:27 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
so i have to hit reject and start all over?


[01/29/2021 11:27 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
because i didn't have enough the first time


[01/29/2021 11:27 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
so i pay twice?


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] zai#0518
the approval transaction stays valid until revoked


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] zai#0518
no need to approve again


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] zai#0518
you will only need to pay for deposit


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
what happens if i hit reject right now


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
do the funds go back?


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] zai#0518
no


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
lol


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
okay


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
so if i exit out of this window


[01/29/2021 11:28 PM] zai#0518
look, you are going to have to do 4 transactions:


[01/29/2021 11:29 PM] zai#0518
1. approve USDC on Curve
2. Deposit into Curve
3. Approve the yUSDC receipt token on yearn
4. deposit into yearn vault


[01/29/2021 11:29 PM] zai#0518
2 is expensive


[01/29/2021 11:30 PM] zai#0518
others should be less than $10 each at current gas price


[01/29/2021 11:30 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
so if i go straight into the vaults section though i can just deposit straight USD or DAI or whatever


[01/29/2021 11:30 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
same with the earn section


[01/29/2021 11:30 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i get it that with vaults people vote


[01/29/2021 11:30 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
they seem so similar


[01/29/2021 11:31 PM] zai#0518
yes, you can deposit into earn directly, but that is much lower %


[01/29/2021 11:31 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
yes i see


[01/29/2021 11:31 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i am doing a small test amount to just get started... anyhow... how much simply to enter one position roughly with your method your outlined with those 4 steps... around $50?


[01/29/2021 11:31 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
100$?


[01/29/2021 11:32 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i guess you really do need to do a large amount of $$


[01/29/2021 11:32 PM] zai#0518
right now, you should be on with $50 for all those transaction


[01/29/2021 11:32 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
last but not least, how do i go about finishing this transaction from here... I don't have the 22 in ether... so should i go buy $22 in ether to confirm this?


[01/29/2021 11:32 PM] zai#0518
gas is tolerable, but it could get worse if network gets more clogged. which it does all the time


[01/29/2021 11:33 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i'm afraid to exit out of the window b/c i don't wanna ruin the trnsxn again


[01/29/2021 11:33 PM] zai#0518
it remembers you


[01/29/2021 11:33 PM] zai#0518
you can close out


[01/29/2021 11:33 PM] zai#0518
buy more ETH


[01/29/2021 11:33 PM] zai#0518
you will need it


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
so close out...buy the eth... transfer to metamask.... come back... hit confirm... in the future... if i deposit money directly... expect two seperate transactions... one just to approve the contract, and then one to confirm afterwards


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
does that all sound correct to you?


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
with your method suggested it's really 4 transactions


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
but with directly deposit a stable coin currency it's basically two trsnsxns, no?


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] zai#0518
yes


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
OMFG


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
haha


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] zai#0518
you always approve first


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
okay thank you


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
also


[01/29/2021 11:34 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
this is a more general thing...


[01/29/2021 11:35 PM] zai#0518
otherwise the contract has no right to take your asset


[01/29/2021 11:35 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
last thing


[01/29/2021 11:35 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i don't want to waste your time tysm i can tell you are knowledgable


[01/29/2021 11:37 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
my buddy just made like half a million with bit coin and i'm considering just going all in on bitcoin or somethinb but these return rates look really nice and yearn seems like it's low key the gold standard from everything i've seen... even then... in the range of 20-40% returns seem too good to be true... I believe it because I've been studying it and i see the value prop and i believe... i've researched this... but can you tell me what you would consider the downsides/ risks? I understand if it's not appropriate from the help desk... this is my last and final thing... more so as someone that's just really interested and pretty sold after a bunch of podcasts/ videos and considering learning the entire process myself... also... harvest.finance has really nice return rates... but i know someone who got hacked... and the fact that they are anonymous seems really scammy... not at all like yearn


[01/29/2021 11:37 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
MY FINAL THOUGHTS! Tysm i can tell youa re very knowledgable... by the look of your username i can tell you would perhaps advise to just invest in the yearn.finance token lol.


[01/29/2021 11:39 PM] zai#0518
do 50/50


[01/29/2021 11:39 PM] zai#0518
any protocol could get hacked or have a bug


[01/29/2021 11:39 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
are you in harvest.finance?


[01/29/2021 11:39 PM] zai#0518
presumably yearn is safer, but don't go 100% into anything in defi


[01/29/2021 11:40 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
ok


[01/29/2021 11:40 PM] zai#0518

i was telling my friend who just made like 500k bro you could just put it all in yearn and earn like a huge chunk when it hits around 40% even in just stable coins

[01/30/2021 2:06 PM] arberx#3367
Using metamask?


[01/30/2021 2:07 PM] simoneconti#5575
yes


[01/30/2021 2:07 PM] arberx#3367
There’s an issue with metamask, try adjusting the gas limit in the “advanced” section. Or you can try withdrawing from zapper


[01/30/2021 2:08 PM] arberx#3367
There’s a bunch of questions on this, search the chat you’ll find a couple solutions


[01/30/2021 2:26 PM] simoneconti#5575
I'm trying, let's see. Apparently zapper gives me the same amount (approx 1.5 ETH), I changed the gas in advanced option in metamask.

1. approve USDC on Curve
2. Deposit into Curve
3. Approve the yUSDC receipt token on yearn
4. deposit into yearn vault
2 is expensive
others should be less than $10 each at current gas price

i am on step 1... trying to figure out what to click on curve


[01/30/2021 3:21 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
can you deposit busd into the curvbusd pool on curv.fi/busd?

Hello, I am simply trying to create 1 curvBUSD for testing purposes... I simply want to create one...put it in curve.fi BUSD pool... then take it back out and do one full conversion... i'm on the second authorization step with ethereum... and it wants to charge aboutg $200... I was told this step would be pricey but.... does that seem right? $200 to deposit one BUSD? Seems a little nuts... will it be roughly the same price for a larger  amount of money too? thank you.


[01/30/2021 4:04 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i changed it to a slow gas price and it now wants to charge $132


[01/30/2021 4:08 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i just decided to pay a slow gas price of about $100... I am considering it a learning investment... I will likely do a larger amount to make up for it... i just am successfully doing a dry run with low $$..


[01/30/2021 4:09 PM] corbeezyjd#0364
i am a little appalled the zap tool seems apparently unusable for a noob... it seems deceptive, in a sense, b/c it looks like it can just take busd, for example, and convert it to a curv token... but then it tries to charge you a large amount of money for the gas fee, like 1k worth of eth... and there are no videos or tutorials on how to use it... who was it made for? that's the big thing i'm a little unhappy about... but i'm still pretty much all in on the yearn train.

Hi, I have a question regarding the yEth V1 vault. I deposited some eth 3 days ago. After the first day i noticed my balance had increased. But it hasn't chnaged at all since then. Is there something wrong with the vault? or am i misinterperting how the growth works?


[01/31/2021 5:18 AM] j.#6352
harvest calls are not regular as what you might think. you can check the contract on etherscan to monitor its transactions


[01/31/2021 5:19 AM] circa#8877
Ahhh ok, thanks for the help. So who/what determines when the harvest call is made?


[01/31/2021 5:21 AM] j.#6352
im not sure myself. probably when it thinks it's profitable enough. try asking in #🏦vaults but i would just leave it as it wont make any difference in returns


[01/31/2021 5:22 AM] circa#8877
Ok cool, thanks again!


[01/31/2021 7:56 AM] ONI#6888
harvest is called at an optimal time sometimes days can go by sometimes its hours between calls, depends on the vault and different parameters


[01/31/2021 1:25 PM] Rtoussai#5948

I think last harvest was called 5 days ago. Pretty sure alink is the slowest vault to call harvest. Dont worry its working correctly.

Hi I'm huge fan of Yearn.Finance and had setup an earn account to test out the process. I had about 500 DAI deposited for the last month. It appears all of my DAI was transferred out and converted to ethereum and then removed from my coinbase wallet. I'm not tripping over losing the money if it really is gone. Again it was a test prior to me putting a significantly larger value into the account. I'm just trying to figure out how it got removed. I'm typically pretty secure with all of my information so if someone could help me figure out what happened I would greatly appreciate it.

Can you enter your address in https://revoke.cash/ and see if you gave the rights to any sketchy site?

@TorJado


[02/01/2021 6:00 PM] TorJado#3802
well I mean like, if I did it, I would only see zapper and uniswap


[02/01/2021 6:05 PM] turnerclassic_#6294
So you would see actual website names and not wallet numbers


[02/01/2021 6:06 PM] turnerclassic_#6294
Well wallet addresses


[02/01/2021 6:09 PM] TorJado#3802
it depends, the site recognizes uniswap, it doesn't recognize zapper for me, but if you click on the address, its a contract I can see the name is zapper


[02/01/2021 6:09 PM] TorJado#3802
I don't know what you approved on your end


[02/01/2021 6:10 PM] turnerclassic_#6294
I see one exchange I don't recognize which is 1inch


[02/01/2021 8:20 PM] turnerclassic_#6294
@TorJado thanks again for pointing me in the right direction. In my search I randomly found 5 eth coins that I randomly forgot about. So at least something came out if this experience. Still trying to figure out what happened but looking at the etherscan I can see an address I don't recognize. I'm not working with Coinbase to get all this cleared up.


[02/01/2021 8:21 PM] turnerclassic_#6294
i'm now* working with coinbase to resolve

lending platform: I deposited y3CRV yesterday when it was announced, all went fine and I see the cyY3CRV in my address.  now trying to withdraw, and transactions are successful, but my cyY3CRV balance remains unchanged and I am not receiving any y3CRV.  Any insights why this could be?  is the underlying collateral unavailable to be retrieved because it is being used for farming on ALPHA?  If so, any idea when that might end?


[02/02/2021 3:37 PM] j.#6352
is it still in your wallet? you may have only done the approval transaction

Hi I would like to claim rewards from ygov finance (https://ygov.finance/stake) since I once staked my YFI in the governance pool,  but I could not select "claim rewards" button.  I understand I need to have voted recently in order to claim rewards, but at the ygov (https://ygov.finance/vote),  recent proposals do not appear (the last proposal showing up is the proposal #40)  so I could not vote anything via this website. Could you tell me how I can claim rewards?


[02/02/2021 8:37 PM] pushpins#2989
use the ygov.rocks interface to claim your rewards @Nipuas

Just curious what is going on with the gas fees to withdrawl YFI from the original Yearn Vault? Are these just inflated gas prices or issues with the protocol?

Hey guys maybe similarly to Mr Bellows, I was trying to withdraw from the TUSD vault but it's showing me gas fees of around 1.4 ETH for maybe $2200 dollars.


[02/04/2021 5:11 PM] arberx#3367
Its a metamask issue


[02/04/2021 5:11 PM] arberx#3367
Search the chat


[02/04/2021 5:11 PM] arberx#3367
You have to configure your gas limits

I would be careful of interacting with eth unless you have to as gas fees are very high now

Hi all, is the v1 yEth vault affected by the recent v1 Dai hack? I'm getting the same notification on both of them.


[02/05/2021 5:24 AM] ONI#6888
only the dai vault was affected


[02/05/2021 5:25 AM] circa#8877
Phew. Weird that the worning shows on the eth vaults too


[02/05/2021 5:25 AM] circa#8877
Thanks ONI

no official statement on that yet


[02/05/2021 12:06 PM] ONI#6888
Actually yes the eth vault was affected as well as it was deposited into the dai vault as I understand it.


[02/05/2021 12:15 PM] arberx#3367
How much was the eth vault affected?


[02/05/2021 12:15 PM] arberx#3367
Any stats?


[02/05/2021 12:27 PM] ONI#6888
well the cdp is viewable and it shows 12.4m dai debt


[02/05/2021 12:29 PM] ONI#6888
so assuming that was in the dai vault 1/3 would be around 4m

[02/05/2021 11:32 PM] iMr.Grey#0487
Will V1 and V2 Vaults merge? Or will V2 substitute V1 at some point? What’s the point of keeping two versions of vaults? And will Earn be discontinued?

Thanks


[02/06/2021 12:05 AM] vany#0365
no merge, there will be v1 and v2. v1 vaults have their place when a coin would not have more than 1 strat (like curve lp vaults). i dont think earn is being discontinued


[02/06/2021 3:32 AM] TorJado#3802
I accidentally sent something to a pool with a gas price too low
I tried resending the same thing over zapper but with the same nonce and a much higher gas fee
I got a contract interaction failed message?

try hard refresh cntrl+shift+r

[02/06/2021 10:18 AM] ONI#6888
yes if you stake in an amm you cannot earn 3crv rewards


[02/06/2021 10:20 AM] King Nut#9734
how does the 3crv rewards work? Is it a snapshot of yvecrv holdings?


[02/06/2021 10:26 AM] j.#6352
curve distributes every thursday


[02/06/2021 11:31 AM] King Nut#9734
then how is it distributed to yvecrv holders?


[02/06/2021 11:39 AM] twinstrust#9020
before the sushi pool - i used to claim my rewards from the claim button on https://crv.ape.tax/ on fridays


[02/06/2021 11:42 AM] twinstrust#9020
someone else will need to advise if we still get 3CRV rewards if we have staked in sushi


[02/06/2021 11:42 AM] j.#6352
https://crv.ape.tax you have to manually claim here. if youre not doing anything with it right away, you can just let it accumulate before claiming


[02/06/2021 11:43 AM] j.#6352
you cant claim it from there but i think it's being worked on. the yvecrv holds its value/claims anyway


[02/06/2021 11:43 AM] twinstrust#9020
correct - you can harvest whenever you want


[02/06/2021 11:44 AM] King Nut#9734
ok tq


[02/06/2021 11:45 AM] twinstrust#9020
correct - so at this point i dont really care that i cant harvest - the sushi rewards are juicy enough to be patient for the 3CRV later

do you mean the v1 dashboard or?

v1 dashboard I guess 55 days ago into the vault


[02/08/2021 5:28 AM] ONI#6888
the dashboard hasn't been working for me either, they are working on a ui update for the new site


[02/08/2021 5:28 AM] ONI#6888
hopefully it will have a dashboard like functionality


[02/08/2021 5:30 AM] Mash#2324
Would have expected the balance visible in the new v2 dashboard where the V1 vault is showing also but it's 0


[02/08/2021 5:31 AM] Mash#2324
And in the v1 dashboard the vault and staking of YFI  is gone


[02/08/2021 5:32 AM] Mash#2324
In zapper it is visible as staked YFI by the way


[02/08/2021 5:48 AM] ONI#6888
what is the v2 dashboard?


[02/08/2021 6:04 AM] Mash#2324

[02/08/2021 6:04 AM] ONI#6888
there is no dashboard here


[02/08/2021 6:04 AM] ONI#6888
the yfi vault is closer to the bottom

the v1 dashboard? ill let them know about it


[02/08/2021 6:23 AM] Mash#2324
yeah the fact that staked YFI balance is not visible anymore, no interaction possible there ...


[02/08/2021 6:35 AM] ONI#6888
staked yfi? you mean yfi in the vault?


[02/08/2021 6:36 AM] ONI#6888
you can interact with the yfi vault here


[02/08/2021 6:57 AM] Mash#2324

Trying to edit the gas myself it says intrinsic gas too low 😦

Hi, I'm trying to withdraw my DAI from https://v1.yearn.finance/lending DAI lending vault, I did 2 attempts, and both ended up doing a high gas price ETH transaction that didn't do anything but interact with a cream contract. How can I get my DAI back? Doesn't seem to work.


[02/09/2021 1:46 AM] ONI#6888
I believe if you dai is being lent out you might not be able to withdrawal it. As this is cream v2 I would go ask in #🍦cream or their discord


[02/09/2021 5:52 AM] Thrum (Professor Phinneas)#0471
What does the collateral toggle do on the https://v1.yearn.finance/lending under supply balance do?  I'm trying to withdraw DAI and the first attempt wasn't successful.   However the toggle was flipped to the left.

I'm wondering does the toggle need to be flipped to the right in order to withdraw my underlying assets?  Trying to flip the toggle wants to charge a transaction fee, so I want to make sure that is what I'm supposed to do before I do it.


[02/09/2021 6:07 AM] Anton#9785
The collateral toggle makes it so that what you supply becomes collateral for lending.
If you don't allow your supplied balance as collateral you won't be able to borrow against the supplied balance.


[02/09/2021 6:11 AM] Anton#9785
So you don't need to toggle collateral to withdraw.


[02/09/2021 7:32 AM] Thrum (Professor Phinneas)#0471

im guessing market movement from sushiswap listing


[02/10/2021 6:34 AM] evtuuv#1262
might have something to do with that its perpetually locked away

hi, i want to join the backscratcher but am wondering about the second step where it says to join sushi:" After depositing join WETH/yveCRV-DAO pool"  is that correct?


[02/10/2021 8:02 AM] chip#1694
i saw on twitter that is says "eth" instead of "weth"


[02/10/2021 8:10 AM] chip#1694
is it basically up to you where you want to stake the yCRVE? is it yCRVE or yCRVE-DAO that is created?


[02/10/2021 8:11 AM] Laur#4570

Is it safe to withdraw from the weth vault?


[02/10/2021 8:57 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[02/10/2021 8:57 AM] ONI#6888
the dai vault was made whole so the weth vault is fine now


[02/10/2021 8:58 AM] lkwtsn#6523
OK 👍 thanks guys


[02/10/2021 9:33 AM] TobyRyth313#9004
May I ask is there any update from the team of the solutions for v1 DAI pool?


[02/10/2021 9:33 AM] ONI#6888
it was fixed already


[02/10/2021 9:35 AM] ONI#6888
your good to go. stay and get good yield or you can withdrawal if you want too. Check your roi for the dai vault here https://yvault-roi.netlify.app/


[02/10/2021 9:39 AM] TobyRyth313#9004
Oh I see, thx. So did the team compensate for the loss or just figured out the way to retrieve the loss?


[02/10/2021 9:40 AM] ONI#6888
uh, we took out a loan on YFI that we have to pay back


[02/10/2021 9:40 AM] ONI#6888
so we moved the loss to the protocol so it can cover it with fees from the yearn ecosystem


[02/10/2021 9:43 AM] TobyRyth313#9004

[02/10/2021 9:46 AM] TobyRyth313#9004
Of course. So for now, we can just ignore the NOTE "Due to recent hack, do not withdraw from DAI V1 vault …" right? And using v1 vault is still recommended as well?


[02/10/2021 9:46 AM] ONI#6888
yes

hi, i have a question on the yveCRV. i deposit and follow instructions - joined sushi and then pickle. My balance in the y vault is zero. Is that correct?


[02/11/2021 5:16 AM] j.#6352
yes


[02/11/2021 5:25 AM] AlonsoC#6284
Hi. Sorry, beginner's q here. I'm looking to add USDC into a Vault. I've connected my Trustwallet via wallet connect, and added up some ETH for fees. When I set amt of USDC (which shows correctly as what's available in my wallet) and hit 'deposit', it only triggers the transaction authorisation and smart contract (for 0ETH) in Trustwallet about 1 in every 3 attempts, and then the transaction has only gone all the way through to depositing USDC in the Vault 1 in all 10 attempts. I'm following the same process, so unclear whyI'm getting different failures. Any pointers welcome, TYIA


[02/11/2021 12:47 PM] kaboji#1243
Hi, quick question, I staked yveCRV/WETH SLP at sushi, can I still stake it at pickle? ```After depositing join WETH/yveCRV-DAO pool for 🍣 rewards and then SLP YVECRV/ETH jar for 🥒 rewards.``` it says **then**, so I am assuming yes? But after staking at Sushi,  on pickle jars UI it couldn't find my SLP anymore...


[02/11/2021 12:52 PM] j.#6352
it's one or the other


[02/11/2021 2:02 PM] kaboji#1243
kk thanks


[02/11/2021 2:03 PM] kaboji#1243
on the YFI website, maybe change `and then` to `or`


[02/11/2021 2:03 PM] kaboji#1243
to be less confusing


[02/11/2021 2:03 PM] kaboji#1243
`and then` makes me think I can do both


[02/11/2021 2:13 PM] arberx#3367
Wait, no, you can deposit the sushi slp to pickle


[02/11/2021 2:13 PM] arberx#3367
You can deposit the SLP to pickle


[02/11/2021 2:13 PM] kaboji#1243
but I already staked the SLP at Sushi


[02/11/2021 2:14 PM] kaboji#1243
before staking SLP at Sushi, I won't get Sushi reward


[02/11/2021 2:14 PM] arberx#3367
Ah if you stake it, that's different


[02/11/2021 2:14 PM] arberx#3367
But if you take your SLP, you can deposit it in pickle


[02/11/2021 2:14 PM] kaboji#1243
providing liquidity can only earn fees 😢


[02/11/2021 2:15 PM] kaboji#1243
so basically on the instruction `for :sushi: rewards` and `for :cucumber: rewards` are mutual exclusive


[02/11/2021 2:15 PM] arberx#3367
So you're currently trading:
pickle rewards on the SLP for staked sushi rewards


[02/11/2021 2:16 PM] kaboji#1243
yeah thanks for the clarification : )


[02/11/2021 2:17 PM] arberx#3367
Did know you had to stake your SLP to get sushi rewards, I thought they just compounded on top?


[02/11/2021 2:20 PM] j.#6352
the staked sushi earning sushi rewards are in onsen so you cant put it in pickle. so one or the other. masterchef or jar>farm

Hey, I am confused. Yesterday I managed to deposit USDC into a vault without any problem, but today, I try to deposit sUSD into a Yearn and it doesn't seem to work. I have my Ledger connected to my MetaMask with app Ethereum opened on it. I have ETH on my wallet to pay for Gas fees. But when I validate the transaction a first time with the MM pop-up, then it just loads forever without really doing anything. What could be the issue please ?


[02/11/2021 3:55 PM] arberx#3367
Could be the wallet/browser. 

Have heard of ledger/metamask issues before


[02/11/2021 4:21 PM] Charlie#1575
ok I disconnected the ledger multiple times and at some point it worked! Thanks for your help!

[02/11/2021 4:23 PM] Charlie#1575
It's not possible to see my coins on my MetaMask interface while they are in a vault on yearn right?


[02/11/2021 4:32 PM] arberx#3367
You received ytokens back


[02/11/2021 4:32 PM] arberx#3367
These represent your share of the specific vault


[02/11/2021 4:32 PM] arberx#3367
You have to manually add the address to metamask, they don’t show up automatically


[02/11/2021 4:33 PM] arberx#3367
Look at your wallet address on etherscan, you should see them listed under “tokens”


[02/11/2021 4:39 PM] Charlie#1575
Cool! It worked! I was looking on CoinGecko first and couldn't find it!


[02/11/2021 4:40 PM] Charlie#1575
Although it doesn't show my ySUSD yet


[02/11/2021 4:41 PM] Charlie#1575
I also managed to get my hand on some aLINK, which are currently stored in the same wallet, but they don't show as available when looking on the corresponding vault. They are not detected


[02/11/2021 4:42 PM] arberx#3367
aLink vault I think has deposits disabled


[02/11/2021 4:43 PM] arberx#3367
Not sure about the ySUSD, maybe the transaction wasn't successful? :peeposhrug:


[02/11/2021 4:49 PM] arberx#3367

Hi!  Thanks in advance for your help.  So I deposited into the USDC vault three days ago.  I'm just wondering, how long will it be until I see lifetime earnings on feeltheyearn?  Right now its blank.


[02/12/2021 12:05 AM] youngestdrake#4834
Thank you so much for this!  I have been trying to figure out how to "receive" my yUSDC for a week now!  It really isn't documented anywhere that I can find.

[02/12/2021 12:10 AM] youngestdrake#4834
Also, is there any way to see earnings on one of the "Earns"?  I deposited into the Dai Earn but I can't find a site that gives me feedback on what I've earned like Feel the Yearn does.  Thanks!


[02/12/2021 12:11 AM] youngestdrake#4834
Not expecting returns in three days obviously, but just trying to figure this all out.


[02/12/2021 12:12 AM] arberx#3367
Hard to see returns rn, the original v1 should show you "earn" returns, or any of the links in "community calculators" here: #🔗links

Hi, I have rewards for staking YFI in v2 governance, never voted. Is there a way to claim it still? The claim button is disabled.


[02/12/2021 6:48 AM] ONI#6888
ygov.rocks in #🔗links  you can claim there


[02/12/2021 1:24 PM] dinvest#3008
Hey guys, till today i just lending directly through compound...just recognized i could use yean.finance earn instead, to get the best interest rate from several protocols...so my question: If i do it through yearn.finance, i cant claim the reward tokens from the protocols like COMP, correct? so if i compare the yean.finance APY with the APY directly from the proctocols, i have to keep that in mind, is that correct? Anyway, i know that the value of the reward tokens can change fast....


[02/12/2021 1:27 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
That's the whole point of yearn.  To do the work for you.  Yearn claims the rewards on your behalf (auto-selling them for you).


[02/12/2021 1:27 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
but does it in bulk to reduce transaction costs


[02/12/2021 1:29 PM] dinvest#3008

@ONI is there any difference between the Yearn stETH vault and the one Pickle is offering? pretty much exact same, no?  both are auto-rebuying LIDO and CRV?


[02/12/2021 1:36 PM] ONI#6888
should be except you can earn pickle rewards in pickle if you restake


[02/12/2021 1:36 PM] Blackthorne#6730
would the Yearn one benefit from yveCRV in your wallet?


[02/12/2021 1:37 PM] ONI#6888
what do you mean?


[02/12/2021 1:38 PM] ONI#6888
10% of all crv farmed from the curve vaults goes to the yveCRV vault


[02/12/2021 1:38 PM] ONI#6888
which inturn boosts all the curve vaults


[02/12/2021 1:38 PM] Blackthorne#6730
my understanding is that either veCRV or yveCRV help boost all the Curve vaults across the entire Yearn ecosystem....


[02/12/2021 1:39 PM] Blackthorne#6730
i know but you have to have yveCRV in your wallet, not in the Sushi pool, in order to get a boost on Yearn Curve vaults right?


[02/12/2021 1:39 PM] ONI#6888
no


[02/12/2021 1:39 PM] ONI#6888
yveCRV is just the vault token for that vault


[02/12/2021 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
you have to have it in your wallet to claim 3crv every week


[02/12/2021 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
if you have it in an amm pool like sushi you cannot claim ur rewards


[02/12/2021 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
where yveCRV tokens are does not effect vault boosts


[02/12/2021 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
all vaults are boosted for everyone equally


[02/12/2021 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
you dont need to hold yveCRV tokens to get yearn boost


[02/12/2021 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
everyone gets it regardless for free


[02/12/2021 1:41 PM] Blackthorne#6730
oh i see so all the max boosties are already being applied for everyone


[02/12/2021 1:41 PM] Blackthorne#6730
yeah kk


[02/12/2021 1:41 PM] ONI#6888
no I never said that


[02/12/2021 1:41 PM] ONI#6888
but some % of boost that we can do yes


[02/12/2021 1:41 PM] Blackthorne#6730
yeah kk


[02/12/2021 1:41 PM] ONI#6888
so for instance ycrv aka yUSD vault is nowhere close to fully boosted


[02/12/2021 1:42 PM] Blackthorne#6730
so the benefit of building up yveCRV over the long-term is to be able to claim the 3pool weekly.

[02/12/2021 1:43 PM] ONI#6888
you can see boost stats here


[02/12/2021 1:43 PM] ONI#6888
yearn has 7.7% of all veCRV locked with us


[02/12/2021 1:43 PM] ONI#6888
this allows us to boost our yUSD vault by 37% over normal crv rates


[02/12/2021 1:43 PM] ONI#6888
fully boost is 250%


[02/12/2021 1:44 PM] ONI#6888
we have so much AUM in that vault that its hard to fully boost it would take 27m veCRV whereas we only have 6.6m locked


[02/12/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
yes and you get to claim more over just locking your veCRV with curve


[02/12/2021 1:45 PM] Blackthorne#6730
excellent thanks. is that chart publicly available somewhere?


[02/12/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
as the vaults lock 10% of all farmed crv but do **not** claim their rewards its given to everyone else who locks


[02/12/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
it will be soon


[02/12/2021 1:46 PM] Blackthorne#6730
Great. Thx for the help, much appreciated ser.


[02/12/2021 1:46 PM] ONI#6888
https://crv.ape.tax/ you can see here that backscratcher aka yveCRV vault gives 1.301 times more weekly rewards than curve


[02/12/2021 1:47 PM] ONI#6888
if you lock your crv with us


[02/12/2021 1:48 PM] ONI#6888
but you loose the ablity to boost your own funds on curve with that lock CRV and you dont get to vote. So... its up to each person


[02/12/2021 1:49 PM] Blackthorne#6730
cool. i was fortunate enough to have farmed YFi from almost day 1, but still learning the intricacies of Curve. it's a bit complex and i've never fully understood all the details. but you've been a big help.


[02/12/2021 1:49 PM] ONI#6888

[02/12/2021 1:52 PM] ONI#6888
yes


[02/12/2021 1:52 PM] ONI#6888
I would recommend not moving the vault tokens might mess up claiming rewards not fully sure on that. For just yveCRV vault


[02/12/2021 1:53 PM] Blackthorne#6730
yeah cool. i am not worried about claiming them at the moment, trying to build up a stack in the sushi/pickle farm for now.


[02/12/2021 2:12 PM] youngestdrake#4834
Hi all, does anyone know of a page where I can better understand liquidity pools, LP tokens, what to do with LP tokens, and rewards?  I've been digging and digging, but still doesn't make complete since.  Like, if I add to a liquidity pool on uniswap (or wherever) in Eth and DIA, I get LP tokens in return, right?  Then, what do I do with those LP tokens so i can get rewards?  and the rewards in this case would be in Uniswap tokens, right?

[02/12/2021 2:14 PM] arberx#3367
You can't do much with yUSDC (or anything) rn


[02/12/2021 2:14 PM] arberx#3367
It's just your share of the vault


[02/12/2021 2:15 PM] youngestdrake#4834
Thanks ArberX.  I've actually been watching those.  They help explain it conceptually... but then it doesn't get into explicit examples like I mentioned above which is where I'm confused.


[02/12/2021 2:16 PM] youngestdrake#4834
Okay awesome, that answers a big question for me.  One of the yfinance pages seems to indicate that there is something you can do with it.

Guys, can somebody tell me the difference between using the y.curve.fi pool via yearn and directly put my coins in the curve y pool on curve.fi?


[02/13/2021 12:51 PM] j.#6352
The Y vault in Yearn farms the LP token of the Y pool in Curve


[02/13/2021 12:52 PM] ONI#6888
Yah yearn auto sells the farmed asset. Curve will not. Yearn also autoboosts curve pools


[02/13/2021 4:29 PM] Apollo#4937
Are all V2 vaults automatically insured by Cover? Thought I saw an Andre tweet to that effect.


[02/13/2021 5:09 PM] Captain Torch#1908
If it is not a big trouble, could someone make one question clear for me? 
I feel crazy about gas fee, try using gas trakers, but it is still much bigger than it was mention.


[02/13/2021 5:10 PM] Captain Torch#1908
so, i heard that metamask has high inner fee...is that true????


[02/13/2021 5:18 PM] fewture#0193
my uneducated view is onsen > pickle for return. am i missing something?


[02/13/2021 5:19 PM] j.#6352
i personally would do the same


[02/13/2021 5:21 PM] TheBlackCat#5064
@Unknown also heard about that and also think that it is true. But still no proofs, unfortunately.


[02/13/2021 5:25 PM] Captain Torch#1908
@Unknown So, got any suggestions how to avoid it???


[02/13/2021 5:26 PM] TheBlackCat#5064
Only most obvious - never use it, if possible 😉


[02/13/2021 5:26 PM] Captain Torch#1908
then...what are alternative wallets?


[02/13/2021 5:27 PM] TheBlackCat#5064

[02/14/2021 3:09 AM] erikpa#1341
I intended to withdraw from aLINK vault at just 121 gwei, but the calculated fees in MetaMask seem enormous! Is this calculation realistic? I don't wanna pay that much or even risk some failure.

hi, I can't see the effective APY of vaults, where can I find it? and the strategies of vaults


[02/14/2021 8:31 AM] j.#6352
clicking on the names of the vaults will lead you to the strategy contracts


[02/14/2021 8:32 AM] ONI#6888
aLINK is a delegated vault so it could be correct. I think alink has the highest withdrawal fee of all vaults.


[02/14/2021 9:30 AM] erikpa#1341

[02/14/2021 9:37 AM] dinvest#3008
i just read the Wiki for earn (https://docs.yearn.finance/products/earn) several times, but not understanding everything to 100%...so if i put some stablecoins into yearn earn (https://v1.yearn.finance/earn), do i automatically serve as i liquidity priovider fpr the curve YPool?


[02/14/2021 9:49 AM] ONI#6888
no


[02/14/2021 9:50 AM] ONI#6888
the earn is one thing and the ypool on curve is another


[02/14/2021 9:50 AM] ONI#6888
they are related but not the same


[02/14/2021 9:50 AM] ONI#6888
earn is just automated lending that is all


[02/14/2021 9:50 AM] ONI#6888
the curve y pool is a curve amm for y-tokens


[02/14/2021 9:51 AM] ONI#6888
earn ycrv tokens


[02/14/2021 9:51 AM] ONI#6888
you **can** provide your earn y tokens to the pool to add liquidity and earn swap fees but you dont **have** to


[02/14/2021 9:52 AM] ONI#6888
there is also the earn b tokens that comprise of the busd curve pool


[02/14/2021 9:52 AM] dinvest#3008
now i fully understand 🙂 so if i do that, that could be a huge performance boost, but on the other site has more risk


[02/14/2021 9:52 AM] ONI#6888
yep


[02/14/2021 9:52 AM] ONI#6888
earn is the least risky


[02/14/2021 9:52 AM] ONI#6888
curve lping is more risky


[02/14/2021 9:52 AM] ONI#6888
and vaults is another layer


[02/14/2021 9:53 AM] ONI#6888
but that doesnt mean all the risks are the same or equal levels. Different vaults use different protocols. Different curve pools have different pegged tokens


[02/14/2021 9:53 AM] dinvest#3008
okay and a huge difference to f.e. IDLE is, that yearn automatically claims the governance tokens of the lending protocols and reinvest them, is that correct too?


[02/14/2021 9:54 AM] ONI#6888
yearn Vaults product auto farms for you yes


[02/14/2021 9:54 AM] ONI#6888
yearn Earn products auto lend


[02/14/2021 9:54 AM] ONI#6888
yes idle and curve do not auto compound and save you gas


[02/14/2021 9:54 AM] ONI#6888
they just give you their token


[02/14/2021 9:55 AM] ONI#6888
to realize those apy's on curve and idle you have to manully sell the token back into the base asset


[02/14/2021 9:55 AM] ONI#6888
if you hold the token and it drops in price your yield will be lower


[02/14/2021 9:57 AM] dinvest#3008
yeah, in market times like now you could say its cool to collect and claim on your own and sell in the future, but in average it should be more clever to sell instantly...but thats only my opinion 🙂


[02/14/2021 9:57 AM] ONI#6888
depends if you want to hold or sell but yah. So yearn vaults auto farm and redeposit back to the base asset for you. Along with keep the best strategy for the base token to farm on


[02/14/2021 9:59 AM] dinvest#3008
yes...thanks for the fast and easy to understand answers

[02/14/2021 10:36 AM] dinvest#3008
one last question, to fully understand: You wrote "yean Earn products auto lend" => so am i correct, that technically the claimed/earned governance tokens will be auto sell/swapt back to my initial supplied currency (so for example to DAI) and auto lend again?


[02/14/2021 10:45 AM] dinvest#3008
to be clear: i refer to yearn earn


[02/14/2021 3:03 PM] 0xJ29#6730
Is there a vault that swaps between various stablecoins to take advantage of the largest yield in different coins?

$393. I just withdrew from yfi vault and the fee was muuuch less - 0.00836044 Ether ($15.21) 
the yalink fee is what metamask shows

earn doesnt deal with governance tokens. You deposit dai and it lends dai. or usdc or busd ect. Lends it to the best apy for lending of that coin

Let me take a look at that. So in general I try to just give permission for the amount I deposit at the time. Plus some margin, rounding up. My idea was to put another permission later for the next deposit. But maybe that's not a good approach. What would you recommend?

so.. gas ie gwei is how fast it gets processed


[02/19/2021 2:14 AM] ONI#6888
gas limit is how much eth you can use up till it stops the excution of code


[02/19/2021 2:14 AM] ONI#6888
it has nothing to due with slippage

yes, but becareful


[02/19/2021 2:14 AM] ONI#6888
you make sure its not tooo high or it could take alott of eth


[02/19/2021 2:15 AM] ONI#6888
oh yah you could try it


[02/19/2021 2:15 AM] ONI#6888
also you can see what the gas limit is an raise it a tad over might help


[02/19/2021 2:16 AM] ONI#6888
dont increase it like by double but maybe 10% more or something


[02/19/2021 2:16 AM] ONI#6888
but again the team is looking into ur case so probably best to just wait to they have something to say


[02/19/2021 2:16 AM] ONI#6888
it would suck to keep wasting gas


[02/19/2021 2:21 AM] ONI#6888
usually its best to use yearn through metmask, I was asking you to uninstall and reinstall metamask. But you can use yearn through just ledger via the sign-in I think it just doesnt let you go through multiple eth accounts

Hi, what is the main key difference for staking CRV on curve.fi and staking in yveCRV vault?


[02/19/2021 4:22 AM] ONI#6888
The main difference between staking CRV on curve and yearn is this:

Curve you get to vote on pool weights each week and you can boost your own capital in curve pools. Also you get weekly fees. Have to manually relock to extend the life of you veCRV lock. Cannot move your veCRV.

Yearn: you can earn 44.8% more weekly rewards and yveCRV is liquid. No voting on weights, no using the vault veCRV for your own capital in curve, it is used to boost all of yearns vaults (good for everyone)

So its more about why you want to lock veCRV. See https://crv.ape.tax/ for more info.

Hi, I'm new to Yearn.  I deposited my USDC into Earn but am not clear how the interest rates work.  I've been watching it grow but the rate of growth seems significantly lower then the posted interest rate.  I've checked to make sure I'm not missing a drop in interest so that's not it.  What am I missing?  Second question, if I understand Earn correctly, it cycles between lender platforms to maximize yield in real time.  But the listed interest rate is sometimes smaller then what I see listed on AAVE.  Am I misunderstanding the posted interest rate or how Earn works?  Thanks in advance for your assistance.


[02/19/2021 7:07 AM] cheeseseeker#8606
@ONI thank you for your prompt answer. So depositing on yearn yveCRV vault is the same as crv.ape.tax?


[02/19/2021 7:08 AM] cheeseseeker#8606
Guess I need to accumulate some CRV so that it is worth the gas fees to do vault approval and deposits.


[02/19/2021 7:19 AM] j.#6352
It’s currently cheaper to buy yvecrv on sushiswap than it is to deposit crv for yvecrv on crv.ape.tax or yearn

I can't connect my ledger nano S with metamask, i'm having an issue too with it... it tries forever..

wtf?


[02/19/2021 1:02 PM] Yann#4433
to withdraw 4k$, 6k$ is pretty expensive...


[02/19/2021 1:03 PM] arberx#3367
Try zapper


[02/19/2021 1:04 PM] arberx#3367
Yes gas fucking sucks rn


[02/19/2021 2:01 PM] Yann#4433
In zapper it's about 0.8 eth... it is something usual??


[02/19/2021 2:04 PM] arberx#3367
Gas sucks, you can wait for gas to cool down, ETH is reaching for ath rn


[02/19/2021 2:45 PM] Yann#4433
i've finally managed to make it work with ledger in metamask.. now my concern is about the withdraw transaction price...


[02/19/2021 2:56 PM] Yann#4433
yes I'll be interested to know


[02/19/2021 5:36 PM] TardigradeHegemon#5117
I'm following up on my prior inquiry.  I'm not understanding how the displayed percentage performance compares to actual results in Yearn Earn USDC.  The Dashboard isn't very clear because it seems to be calculating in USD instead of USDC.  (BTW, this is confusing to us non-tech types.  I recommend that it be changed to operate more like AAVE's interface, showing USDC actual increases as well as USD estimates.) When I go in https://v1.yearn.finance/earn I see the USDC values.  The problem there is that the increases there I calculate look significantly lower then the published rate, taking into account how it fluctuates over time.  Are those interest rates shown in USD instead of USDC?  Is there something else I'm missing.  Please help.


[02/19/2021 5:55 PM] arberx#3367
Check out stats there


[02/19/2021 6:06 PM] Apollo#4937
Are yearn vaults automatically Covered?


[02/19/2021 6:49 PM] TardigradeHegemon#5117
Thanks for the help @arberx. That site is helpful.  Is there anywhere better I can see the numbers?  The best this provides is daily price increases extrapolated from their graphs.  I still don't understand the relationship of what the interest rate appears to be and the numbers displayed everywhere.  Three more questions if you don't mind: 1) is there a place I can see the actual rules used to move the funds around, 2) what is the commission paid to Yearn for this USDC Earn Vault, if any, and 3) are there different yUSDC tokens?  There seem to be two different ones related to two different Earn Vaults with different values.  And thanks again in advance for your help in answering my novice questions!!

Hi, does anyone know what is the fee structure for v1 vaults like gusd?  is there still a withdraw fee?


[02/19/2021 9:44 PM] arberx#3367
All those questions can be answered reading the docs, checkout #🔗links


[02/20/2021 1:15 AM] TardigradeHegemon#5117
I've checked out all the Earn documentation I can find at that link and elsewhere and couldn't find the answers I need.  Can you guide me to the correct location please?


[02/20/2021 1:17 AM] arberx#3367
1) the strategies vary, some are documented. For earn, the vault just moves around your funds to the best apy on either comp, aave and some others. 2) earn and v1 have a withdraw fee 3) no other yusdc token


[02/20/2021 1:17 AM] arberx#3367
Your “ytokens” represent your share or the vault

Hello! I'm having issues trying to withdraw from TUSD vault. Withdrawing from USDC vault worked fine, but I'm getting huge gas fees for trying to withdraw from TUSD and "ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code."

I've seen there are a few others having this issue as well. Has there been a solution yet?


[02/20/2021 5:10 AM] ONI#6888

[02/20/2021 5:30 AM] TardigradeHegemon#5117
Thanks for the answers.  I guess what I'm trying to figure out is how much of a return I'm actually getting.  There are various percentage numbers displayed but none of them seem consistent.  If I look at the USDC value of yUSDC over the last 30 days as per https://yearn-finance.vercel.app/ (which also currently displays 12.24% yearly growth) I see the yUSDC value grow from 1.1856 to 1.1952 over the last month.  That works out to an annualized rate of 9.72%, which is lower then any rate showing anywhere for the Earn vault.  AAVE's published rates for that same period are 11.18%.  I understand the basic Earn strategy of optimizing between AAVE, Comp and dydx for return.  That's simple enough.  So why is the actual return both lower then that listed anywhere and lower then what can be gotten by just leaving USDC in AAVE?  Without visibility into the actual rules and workings of USDC Earn I can't figure that out.  That's why I'm here, trying to figure out / verify 1) what the actual rate of return for Earn (and Vaults) are and 2) if those returns are worth it.  Can you please clarify these discrepancies or let me know how I can understand what's going on here better?  Thanks again in advance for all your help in understanding what's going on.

how much is each vault boosted in the first place and how is this decided?


[02/20/2021 11:48 AM] ONI#6888
voting is proportional to AUM for the curve vaults


[02/20/2021 11:48 AM] ONI#6888
on yearn.finance it shows how much they are boosted in the apy calculations


[02/20/2021 12:01 PM] ArzrA#0305
so I can take the boosting rates I see in comparison to the AUM and this shows me where they will end up with more inflow


[02/20/2021 12:02 PM] ONI#6888
I am under the impression that under 5m or so is fully boosted for most vaults


[02/20/2021 12:02 PM] ONI#6888
any crv vault that is under that should be fully boosted


[02/20/2021 12:02 PM] ArzrA#0305
I went through the forceHarvest() to get an understanding of the "fee" that is taken... seems like they are used to deposit for more boosting


[02/20/2021 12:02 PM] ArzrA#0305
why is this different between different vaults?


[02/20/2021 12:03 PM] ONI#6888
v1 and v2 act differently


[02/20/2021 12:03 PM] ONI#6888
I would ask in #🏦vaults about that specific method im not sure about its usage


[02/20/2021 12:04 PM] ArzrA#0305
I looked at GUSD, USDN and BUSD seems like they are all v1


[02/20/2021 12:04 PM] ONI#6888
yes

[02/21/2021 10:01 AM] jpegging#4909
@Yearn Admin now my deposited balance is showing as 0 in the yearn yveCRV vault, it's also showing as 0 in the pickle jar, and only shows in the backscratcher pickle farm. I appear to only be earning negligible pickle rewards after the whole process, rather than 3CRV + Sushi + pickle rewards


[02/21/2021 10:02 AM] ONI#6888
I answered your question on telegram 😄


[02/21/2021 10:03 AM] jpegging#4909
so you can only earn 3CRV or sushi or pickle? You cant earn all 3?


[02/21/2021 10:06 AM] jpegging#4909
whats the point of going through this lengthy process with associated gas fees then? It's better to just leave the yveCRV in the yearn vault and earn 75% in 3CRV. And why does it say this on the yveCRV vault in that case?

[02/21/2021 10:08 AM] jpegging#4909
whats the point of adding to the pickle jar and then to the backscratcher ?


[02/21/2021 10:18 AM] ONI#6888
you can if you unstake right before the snapshot on thursday, but this isnt reasonable for some due to gas prices. So for now yes. These amm pools cannot harvest the 3crv and gets lost afaik.


[02/21/2021 10:19 AM] ONI#6888
because you can earn 90ish in pickle and 170ish in sushi


[02/21/2021 10:24 AM] jpegging#4909
but I am not earning the 170ish in sushi, I am only earning the 90ish pickle rewards from the backscratcher and thats it. shouldnt my deposit also show in the pickle jar? To clarify, following the above process, should i be earning any actual sushi or pickle only?


[02/21/2021 10:29 AM] ONI#6888
if your in pickle you earn pickle, if your in sushi you earn sushi


[02/21/2021 10:29 AM] ONI#6888
pickle will take your sushi and auto compound it like yearn vaults do


[02/21/2021 10:29 AM] jpegging#4909
so I should be earning 170+90 = 260ish in pickle basically?


[02/21/2021 10:30 AM] ONI#6888
no


[02/21/2021 10:30 AM] ONI#6888
please look at this picture it is what you are earning


[02/21/2021 10:30 AM] ONI#6888
nothing else


[02/21/2021 10:30 AM] ONI#6888
these are not additive

this inculdes sushi


[02/21/2021 10:30 AM] ONI#6888
actually this pays out in more of the pickle lp token


[02/21/2021 10:31 AM] ONI#6888
and they show you where this apy comes from


[02/21/2021 10:33 AM] jpegging#4909
ok, so basically with yveCRv you can either just earn 70% in 3CRV. OR 200% (2/3 locked),in sushi OR 90% in pickle and then TRY and time the snapshot for 3CRV as well? so if I withdraw the SLP from sushi swap those yveCRV will automatically go back to Yearn yveCRV vault for 3CRV rewards, correct?


[02/21/2021 10:38 AM] ONI#6888
yes that is correct


[02/21/2021 10:38 AM] ONI#6888
if you fully unwind yes


[02/21/2021 10:39 AM] ONI#6888
so unstake from farm, unstake from jar, ustake from the sushi lp pool and get yveCRV and ETH (or WETH) back


[02/21/2021 10:40 AM] ONI#6888
then you will see your yveCRV in yearn and can claim ur rewards


[02/21/2021 10:40 AM] ONI#6888
then you can restake all the way to either sushi or pickle


[02/21/2021 10:40 AM] jpegging#4909
ok thanks. the way it is displayed on the yearn vault and  https://crv.ape.tax/is pretty misleading. It makes it sound like you will earn 3 CRV automatically while following the other steps. just FYI


[02/21/2021 10:41 AM] ONI#6888
it would be nice if someone made a zap for this


[02/21/2021 10:41 AM] ONI#6888
Ok I will let them know and look into it


[02/21/2021 10:59 AM] jpegging#4909
thanks. Do the 3CRV rewards just come through to the yearn yveCRV vault if you have yveCRV there then? Or how do you claim them?


[02/21/2021 10:59 AM] ONI#6888
yes after you withdrawal from the sushi pool


[02/21/2021 11:00 AM] ONI#6888
you yveCRV tokens will just show up at yearn


[02/21/2021 11:00 AM] ONI#6888
and you can claim via the yearn.finance ui


[02/21/2021 11:01 AM] jpegging#4909
you claim  the 3CRV at the yearn yveCRv vault or somewhere else? best to withdraw from sushi SLP every wednesday in order to make sure you make snapshot for thursday 3CRV rewards then?


[02/21/2021 11:29 AM] j.#6352
with current gas, that's probably not a good idea


[02/21/2021 11:30 AM] ONI#6888
it really depends how much yveCRV you have but generally yes not a good idea


[02/21/2021 11:30 AM] j.#6352
that's at least five transactions every week just to claim and redeposit and restake


[02/21/2021 11:30 AM] j.#6352
true


[02/21/2021 11:54 AM] apple8er#0928
Hey All, I've clicked on 'earn' and deposited some dai. My available balance is now 0. The field with claim button underneath is now populated however the value isn't going up. Does the balance refresh every so often depending on the APY?

I got a reply in the tg group from Pp (admin) saying nothing is wrong. I have trouble believing this. It just can't be right to pay >2000 dlrs of fee on a 1000 dlr withdrawl. Do you have any more info from admin ONI on what the problem is. Or at least a confirmation that it IS indeed a problem?

Hello! how can i add some ETH to the crvsETH vault? i have some eth on my wallet but i doesn't show on the yearn crvsETH vault. do i have to make a swap?


[02/22/2021 7:32 PM] BaseD75#1573
Quote from the tg reply on my problem: "There is nothing wrong. It's known that withdrawing from the TUSD strategy directly and not from the vault directly is a very complex transaction hence it cost a lot of gas. As Dark said, you can wait for someone else to deposit to cast the withdrawl if the amount is equal or lower than the amount in the vault. You can track it on stats.finance".

I don't understand this reply at all. I am in the TUSD vault. No strategy should cost me this much, even with these gas fees. And if it is correct that a 1k withdrawl costs 2k then what is the use of yearn at all? And how should that workaround work exactly? Yearn was supposed to be simple and take away all complexity. Now the opposite is happening. I realy need some expert help on this. Can an admin pm me or something please? For me that 1k is important.


[02/22/2021 7:35 PM] arberx#3367
The strategy has to rebalance if the funds are **not** coming from the vault


[02/22/2021 7:35 PM] arberx#3367
That involves some complex transactions.


[02/22/2021 7:37 PM] arberx#3367
With gas fees being what they are, it's painful. I think yearn admins could unwind the entire strategy in one, but for users who still want to be in there it's not fair.


[02/22/2021 7:42 PM] BaseD75#1573
How could the funds NOT come from the vault? I don't understand. And will there be a time that they DO come from the vault? I hope everybody agrees that 2k fee for a 1k withdrawl is ridiculous and needs a solution, or am I the only one here?


[02/22/2021 8:05 PM] arberx#3367
The funds are shifted from vault to strategy depending on a number of factors.


[02/22/2021 8:06 PM] arberx#3367
For example, lets say a strategy deposits to maker to get dai. If ur withdrawing, and you’re withdrawing more than whats in the vault, the strategy has to unwind the maker deposit, rebalance and refund you


[02/22/2021 8:32 PM] Yann#4433
I'm sorry there must be a place where to show exactly the cost of withdrawing, because we are here in hostage, we have to loose a lot to get our money back


[02/22/2021 8:33 PM] Yann#4433
I didn't understood how it was possible, to have such costs, and i made 2 attemps with lower fees

Eth fees are high, and unwinding the strategies are complex, simple as that


[02/22/2021 8:35 PM] arberx#3367
It costs like $250 to open a maker cdp


[02/22/2021 8:37 PM] Yann#4433
We'll have a chat with admins, sorry arberx but it's not a way of dealing with users that uses the platform, we are the clients here, the platfrom made a lot of money on us

I’m not a admin, just a community member.


[02/22/2021 8:38 PM] Yann#4433
if it's too complex close it, and don't let people use it !


[02/22/2021 8:38 PM] Yann#4433
ok then don't speak again to us like we are some children that don't understand a thing


[02/22/2021 8:38 PM] arberx#3367
It’s not about complexity, it’s the network that’s the issue.


[02/22/2021 8:39 PM] arberx#3367
I’m explaining why you’re seeing the gas fees you are.


[02/22/2021 8:39 PM] arberx#3367

So initial costs are high, but after should make up for it depending on what you’re doing


[02/23/2021 12:20 AM] arberx#3367
You can look at other chains as well, FTM seems popular rn


[02/23/2021 1:09 AM] JohnHdn#5132
Ill just wait for it to go down a bit


[02/23/2021 4:19 AM] BaseD75#1573
Why don't they just refund the vault so we can get our money back, this feels like theft. I put in 1k and now its stuck forever?


[02/23/2021 10:58 AM] Yann#4433
snowswap, that's nice! you are saving me ! I'll just wait for the gas to cooldown a bit, and i'll try


[02/23/2021 11:33 AM] Yann#4433
yes same here, i tried 2 times with expensive transactions, lost a lot already, I just want to get outside of it now, won't use yearn again, I've been using BSC now.. Ethereum is way behind... it's sad


[02/23/2021 11:36 AM] Yann#4433
yes i'll do it, when it'll be around 150, thanks for the lead man

That is metamask tell you the tx would fail. Gas fees are high but not that high


[02/23/2021 1:31 PM] ChrisA#1418
Yes, I know this is Metamask holding 1 ETH. And it tells me I can't confirm the withdraw because of insufficient funds.  The transaction fee is 2,23ETH 😨

Try withdrawing with zapper


[02/23/2021 4:17 PM] ChrisA#1418
Fees on Zapper are lower indeed, but 1 eth is still a lot. I think we need to wait for chiiling the market that brings us lower fees.

That's a great lead man! How did you manage to withdraw to just a stable? I only see a swap option to switch to another yearn vault token. Am I missing something?


[02/23/2021 5:56 PM] BaseD75#1573
Is there even an admin in here that could actualy help with this issue. Seems like there are more people having this issue. There must be a way to help us get our money back.


[02/23/2021 6:08 PM] BaseD75#1573
Okay, so if I would switch to yUSDC (I guess the v1) which holds 18m I would have a greater chance of acceptable gas limit/fees? Has anyone tried this recently and knows the ratio between the two options?


[02/23/2021 6:28 PM] BaseD75#1573
Tether is also just fine. Anything that brings my money back. Super thanks, I'll wait a bit for a lower gas fee and try it. If this works you deserve a beer, or wine, or maybe 10 🙂


[02/23/2021 7:46 PM] Yann#4433
Fail again with snowswap from yTUSD to yUSDT

so the tusd withdrawal is failing still?


[02/24/2021 5:38 AM] ONI#6888
and the snowswap zap?

[02/24/2021 10:26 AM] JokerCoin#7413
I have not seen any proceeds getting into that position on Yearn.Finance or Zapper.


[02/24/2021 1:31 PM] JokerCoin#7413
anyone?


[02/24/2021 3:41 PM] ONI#6888
We are working on something for this but it's not out yet.


[02/24/2021 6:48 PM] BaseD75#1573
Goes for me too. Please let us know if this can be fixed or if there is a workaround.


[02/24/2021 7:50 PM] JokerCoin#7413
so its a matter of now showing it? or is not making any yield?


[02/24/2021 7:55 PM] JokerCoin#7413
is there at least a way, to see the harvest calls?


[02/24/2021 8:01 PM] JokerCoin#7413
according to debank the APY on crvPlain3andSUSD is zero. on the yearn website its 60%


[02/24/2021 8:01 PM] JokerCoin#7413
how to find out what is real?


[02/24/2021 11:38 PM] ONI#6888
If share price is 1 harvest hasn't been called. Yield is there everything is working fine.


[02/24/2021 11:39 PM] ONI#6888
You can check share price in the smart contract of the vault.


[02/24/2021 11:40 PM] ONI#6888
If share price hasn't been called yet all you can do is wait for the vault to get more funds and accumulate more crv so then it will harvest


[02/24/2021 11:40 PM] ONI#6888
@Unknown


[02/24/2021 11:40 PM] ONI#6888
60% is correct


[02/24/2021 11:41 PM] ONI#6888
Anything other than our main website probably has wrong apy numbers


[02/25/2021 3:21 AM] MichaeI#6826
Hi, are v2 APY's shown after all fees and v1 before?


[02/25/2021 3:22 AM] ONI#6888
for now this is what is shown but we are working on unifying it


[02/25/2021 3:22 AM] ONI#6888
Curve: weekly, before fees
non-curve: monthly, after fees


[02/25/2021 3:27 AM] MichaeI#6826
if non-curve is monthly, how is that possible that v2 USDC APY went 10% up overnight?


[02/25/2021 3:27 AM] MichaeI#6826
btw all strategies apy's went up 10%+ in past 10 hours


[02/25/2021 8:30 AM] Str8fish#7546
Aside of the awesome vaults, what is yearn currently working on?


[02/25/2021 8:30 AM] Str8fish#7546
Havent heard about yswap and stablecredit for a while


[02/25/2021 1:42 PM] ONI#6888
they rolled out an update to make the apys uniform so that is why. They have to make some minor tweeks then everything will be uniform.


[02/25/2021 7:47 PM] chao#2642
would you mind ELI5 on APYs?
so for UDSC V2 as an example, are you telling me that its 28.37% APY before fees but 2% after?


[02/25/2021 8:08 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
You are comparing apples and oranges.  The underlying apy calcs have been edited over the past week.  The 2% number you saw may have been mid update and doesn’t actually reflect apy but the calc being updated


[02/25/2021 8:35 PM] chao#2642
how are you sure that the 2% number is mid update and not reflective for actual apy?


[02/25/2021 8:35 PM] chao#2642
is there info/ clarification that you see that I don't? genuinely just trying to understand.


[02/25/2021 9:42 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
I can’t say for sure but I know they have been working on apy calcs for the past week.  Check the code changes log and you will see a ton of changes and updates

[02/25/2021 11:03 PM] chao#2642
ty!


[02/26/2021 2:45 AM] ONI#6888
no all apys now are before fees as this is the standard that everyone else uses.


[02/26/2021 2:47 AM] ONI#6888
yes we have updated the apy alot to make changes like from net to gross, from monthly to weekly ect. I think they are still not fully finished but it should all be fixed soon.


[02/26/2021 7:46 AM] elk#0645
I've done the following strategy but think I may be mistaken on where I'm going to earn yield in it:

```
1. Deposit DAI into Yearn earn v1 -> returns yDAI               // <-- earns ~20% APY
2. Deposit yDAI (wrapped) into Curve Y pool -> return yCRV       // <-- earns ~8% APY (trading fees only)
3. Deposit yCRV into Yearn curve.fi/y v1 vault -> returns yUSD   // <-- earns ~11% APY  
```

I'm now thinking I might not be earning any APY on the initial DAI Yearn deposit, because when I deposited that yDAI into Curve, I effectively swapped it back to DAI? is that right? Or can I unwind this at a later date, and choose "withdraw wrapped" and will get back the same amount of yDAI? I imagine it would be a different amount of yDAI


[02/26/2021 8:37 AM] ONI#6888
no you do but no in just dai


[02/26/2021 8:37 AM] ONI#6888
its a y-pool made up of 4 y tokens


[02/26/2021 8:37 AM] ONI#6888
so you have an weighted index of the 4 tokens and they are all getting yield


[02/26/2021 8:38 AM] ONI#6888
but ultimately you can withdrawal to just one of them minus or plus slippage in some cases or withdrawal all 4 out with no slippage


[02/26/2021 8:39 AM] ONI#6888
so yes 1 2 and 3 are correct execpt when you deposit you get the lp token which is ydai+yusdc+ytusd+yusdt which are all earning yield


[02/26/2021 8:39 AM] ONI#6888
if that makes sense


[02/26/2021 8:40 AM] elk#0645
so its correct for me to calculate Yearn's ~20% APY from my DAI deposit on top of Curve's APY and Yearn's yCRV APY?


[02/26/2021 8:41 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[02/26/2021 8:41 AM] elk#0645
wow


[02/26/2021 8:41 AM] elk#0645
I'm manually doing those three steps BTW


[02/26/2021 8:41 AM] ONI#6888
so the apy shown on the site accounts for curve


[02/26/2021 8:41 AM] ONI#6888
not earn tho


[02/26/2021 8:42 AM] ONI#6888
You can think of yCRV as an index of yield bearing stablecoins (yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD) that also generates yield (trading fees from the Curve Y pool) as well. Therefore the price of yCRV is non-decreasing.


[02/26/2021 8:42 AM] elk#0645
ah! so i don't include Curve's 8% as that's included in Yearn's yCRV v1 APY


[02/26/2021 8:42 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[02/26/2021 8:42 AM] ONI#6888
you can add just earn


[02/26/2021 8:43 AM] elk#0645
so total APY is 8% from earn (step 1), and 11% from Yearn yCRV vault v1 (step 3)


[02/26/2021 8:43 AM] elk#0645
~19%


[02/26/2021 8:43 AM] elk#0645
lol should have just deposited into earn


[02/26/2021 8:44 AM] ONI#6888
ycrv = { yDAI (14.06%* 23.02) +yUSDC (30.29% * 8.9684) +yUSDT(33.55% * 15.54)+yTUSD(22.11% * 3.663) } + pool swap fee


[02/26/2021 8:44 AM] ONI#6888
so you can view your yields in ycrv (the curve ypool lp token) like this


[02/26/2021 8:45 AM] ONI#6888
pool % * that coins yield


[02/26/2021 8:45 AM] elk#0645
my strategy doesn't make much sense then i dont think


[02/26/2021 8:46 AM] ONI#6888
so ycrv is gain yeild from the underlying earn tokens at their rates * the ratio of those coins to the pool


[02/26/2021 8:46 AM] ONI#6888
seen https://www.curve.fi/iearn here

{Embed}
https://www.curve.fi/iearn
Curve.fi
Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for: extremely efficient stablecoin trading, low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.


[02/26/2021 8:47 AM] elk#0645
yeah i deposited wrapped into that


[02/26/2021 8:47 AM] ONI#6888
it does matter if you do wrapped or unwrapped


[02/26/2021 8:47 AM] ONI#6888
the pool itself is holding the wrapped token


[02/26/2021 8:48 AM] ONI#6888
so if you deposit unwrapped it will deposit them to Earn for you basically


[02/26/2021 8:49 AM] elk#0645
it just seems like step1 was pointless? I could have deposited my DAI unwrapped into Curve Y pool, then deposited the yCRV into Yearn's yCRV vault


[02/26/2021 8:50 AM] elk#0645
for exact same net effect?


[02/26/2021 8:50 AM] ONI#6888
yes you could have


[02/26/2021 8:50 AM] ONI#6888
it might use more gas to deposit unwrapped into curve than wrapped so it might be the same overall


[02/26/2021 8:51 AM] elk#0645
ah gotcha - silver linings 😄


[02/26/2021 8:51 AM] ONI#6888
im not 100% sure on how they go from unwrapped to wrapped then into the ypool

yes


[02/26/2021 8:53 AM] elk#0645
those aren't the same vaults (even tho it says v1?)


[02/26/2021 8:53 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[02/26/2021 8:54 AM] ONI#6888
this is taking into account that yearn compounds weekly whereas curve does not


[02/26/2021 8:54 AM] ONI#6888
even though yearn might compound more often than weekly in reality


[02/26/2021 8:54 AM] elk#0645
both give yUSD token (but different token contract) ?


[02/26/2021 8:55 AM] ONI#6888
the curve apy is if you add lp, and you sold the crv you got for the whole yearn at the end at the current price. Basically


[02/26/2021 8:55 AM] ONI#6888
no its the same pool


[02/26/2021 8:55 AM] ONI#6888
yearn's vaults compound their interest, curve's does not


[02/26/2021 8:55 AM] elk#0645
so am I actually earning less APY by being in curve.fi/y LP vault rather than yCRV vault?


[02/26/2021 8:56 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[02/26/2021 8:57 AM] ONI#6888

nah i mean stacking the tokens through multiple protocols (in this case back and forth between yearn and curve, i was doing it manually)


[02/26/2021 9:07 AM] ONI#6888

[02/26/2021 9:07 AM] ONI#6888
yah it can be confusing


[02/26/2021 9:08 AM] elk#0645

when should I expect to see the balance updated?


[02/26/2021 3:36 PM] Johnny F#4404
But it does show 8461.56 in the "deposited" column - what are you expecting to see? Or do you mean you added another 8461.56 to the 8461.56 that were already in there?


[02/26/2021 3:43 PM] Juli#8478
And where can I see how much I'm earning?I thought that the deposit number update constantly according to the earning fee


[02/26/2021 3:45 PM] Johnny F#4404
The number of tokens you see there remains the same. But their value increases over time, so when you withdraw, you will have more than what you have deposited. How much exactly? Hard to tell.
Tracking this isnt easy right now though, especially for newer pools like sAave. Usually zapper works for that, but it doesnt know about this pool (yet).

[02/27/2021 3:19 AM] ONI#6888
this is a test ui site same as https://yearn-finance.vercel.app/ which is more up to date i think than yearn.fi. Both are not up to date. APY numbers are off and do not use them for actually depositing or withdrawing from vaults. This are demo ui sites only. Use yearn.finance for transacting.

Hi all! I am new to this and in need of a little help. I want to join the crvSTETH vault, what do I need to deposit - STETH or the LP token I got after depositing to the STETH pool on Curve? Also, what is earned after depositing to a yvault? Do I earn YFI? CRV? more STETH? Thanks in advance for your help🙏


[02/27/2021 9:29 AM] Johnny F#4404
You need to deposit the LP token you get from Curve (deposit there, but do not stake it).
You will earn more of these LP tokens over time in the yearn vault. So you will be able to withdraw more ETH or stETH than you put in, when you decide to get out.

I hadn’t seen any announcement yet, but I assume v2 WETH vault isn’t operating yet and there’s no reason to deposit, correct?

no the vault is working fine but we havent disabled the v1 eth vault withdrawals yet so that is probably why

Ah perfect! Thank you!


[03/01/2021 12:16 AM] ONI#6888
I was told that this vault requires 6m gas limit for the withdrawal to go through, the team is aware of the high fees and is looking into it, but for now at least it seems like that is just how much it cost to withdrawal.


[03/01/2021 4:04 AM] ethacct#4022
literally just deposited in my first yearn vault since gas prices are lower again and have a question: how do i track growth?  will the amount shown in my vault balance just increase over time?


[03/01/2021 4:27 AM] ChrisA#1418
Thanks for the reply ONI. Currently, if you want to earn some money on TUSD vault you have to keep your coins for a  few years in the vault!!! So it's not worth putting money into this vault.  I want to ask is there a way to check withdraw fees before deposit?

I would be careful make sure it has enough gas need 6m, and generally yes it will be expensive


[03/01/2021 7:02 AM] hellfried#0791
So just for my understanding, where are these fees coming from? Is this the 0.5% withdrawal fee? At the current rate it wants 15% of what I put in in the first place.

Ah, found the answer, FWIW: https://old.reddit.com/r/yearn_finance/comments/ixoqn1/negative_earn_rate_tusd/g68unvf/ 
> It depends on the amount you are going to withdraw. If it is enough to trigger the withdraw fee, it's expensive because there are a lot of transactions to be done.

Hello,
I'm trying to access to yearn.finance/vaults but with an ETH watch only address... with Trust wallet and walletConnect... but it "doesn't work"...   
Is it possible to "watch" and use yearn.finance with a watch only address?  
Thanks.


[03/01/2021 9:19 AM] ONI#6888
Probably not if it doesnt work


[03/01/2021 2:18 PM] PubertyPete#4914
I’ve got 1 eth in the eth vault and went to withdraw and it says I have to pay a $478 miner fee. How can it be so high? Does that mean I have to wait until I’ve earned more than $478 in rewards before I can pull it out for a positive return?


[03/01/2021 2:23 PM] Nachshol.eth#4392
it depends on current gas fees, check https://ethgasstation.info/index.php and opt for a transaction during times with low gas fees (under 100 gwei is probably the lowest you'll find). Even under 100 gwei withdrawing will cost a large proportion of your original deposit so it may be reasonable to wait ...

@Unknown I'm new to this, so sorry for the basic question, but why are these transaction so much compared to "normal" transactions? I payed $3 to move eth to my wallet, why is it so much to withdraw from a yearn vault?


[03/01/2021 2:58 PM] ONI#6888
for now you can't. This is something we are working on a good dashboard to visualize returns but its still in the works. All vaults are working and you are getting the apy stated on yearn.finance


[03/01/2021 2:58 PM] ONI#6888
if there are not $ free to be freely withdrawn ie most or all is in the strategy it has to unwind funds to withdrawal for you thus the fee.


[03/01/2021 3:05 PM] adam#0263
Gotcha. And is $500 a typical fee that I should expect? I'm just trying to ballpark how much I would want to have locked and for how long to estimate profit.


[03/01/2021 3:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
My dashboard doesn't seem to be showing returns like it used to (like it used to show my crvcomp vault increasing and now it doesn't)...same thing with my other vaults. Does anyone know what's going on with this?

for some vaults at high gas prices it seems like its high yes, tusd v1 for example

Hi all,
First time using Zapper to zap into the **crvGUSD** vault.
Previously I have done the long way with depositing on Curve first, then proceeding to the Yearn vault.
I'm about to zap a large amount, and not quite sure if I'm being naive about it. 😓

I'd like to ask for a sanity check on whether I'm about to shoot myself in the foot by taking the zapper shortcut. :peepothink2:

When using zapper, closely look at the protocol in your listing


[03/03/2021 9:38 PM] TorJado#3802
If I understand you correctly, you are looking at crvBUSD on Curve
and
ycrvBUSD on yearn


[03/03/2021 9:38 PM] TorJado#3802
two different things


[03/03/2021 9:44 PM] vany#0365
so vault tokens do not equal stables because they are going up in value due to the interest earned. you can see on curve that 1 pool token is worth 1.0146 and then on etherscan you can find the share price of a vault token = 1.089. so take 10000 / 1.0146 and divide that by 1.089 and you will get how many vault tokens you should have. based on those numbers 9085 vault tokens is = ~$10,000

However, I was mostly at a loss with the transaction itself.
I'm probably overthinking it - I'll just go zap on now 😆


[03/03/2021 9:47 PM] vany#0365
all good. but yeah as time goes on you will notice the difference more and more due to the pool and vault tokens going up in value.


[03/03/2021 9:50 PM] kilogold#7310
Actually, while I have you - Where could I read about this yield-bearing mechanism.
What I'm learning is that we don't gain interest, but instead our LP token becomes more valuable. This is a new concept for me. Although there are many instructions around the internet on how to harvest your gains, I haven't found a place where the actual mechanism of how the LP token's value increases is explained.

(this is the same approach that CurveFi uses with their LP tokens, right?)


[03/03/2021 9:53 PM] jdsp#4710
your LP token is a share of the pool; each harvest sells/swaps/whatever the resulting profit for more of the underlying asset, so your share of the pool is worth more when you withdraw

i sent some ftm from eth to fantom using multichain.xyz and while the ethereum transaction succeeded and the History tab says it succeeded, the ftm still hasn't showed up in my fantom wallet.  After that, i also sent some usdc and it showed up.  The History tab for the ftm transaction does say Sent X FTM Received 0 FTM if that provides any clues - is it still just processing maybe?  I did a smaller ftm transfer a couple of days ago that worked fine and I don't remember a delay.  If this isn't the right place to ask, anybody know where is?

question - how do I check when is the good time to withdraw from V1 vaults  ? Amount in Vault vs amount deployed in Strategy ?


[03/04/2021 2:53 PM] j.#6352
you probably only did the approval transaction. you'll have to do the deposit transaction after approval. you can also make this easier by going through zapper or zerion and doing everything in one transaction (+approval) instead of approving Curve, depositing, approving Yearn, and depositing. That's at least four transactions vs one

Question 22:
What is yveCRV, and what can we do with it?
Answer:
yveCRV is the Yearn veCRV Backscratcher Vault token. The vault eternally locks user-deposited CRV, which is used to boost the various Yearn vaults with Curve strategies. In return, Curve fees, paid in 3CRV, that Yearn would have earned from weekly claims are given to those users. yveCRV may be deposited in the WETH-yveCRV pool in Sushiswap, and then staked in Onsen to earn SUSHI. WETH-yveCRV SLP may also be deposited in Pickle Jar, then staked to earn PICKLE. Depositing and staking in Sushiswap or Pickle will not allow you to claim the weekly 3CRV rewards. yveCRV must be held in your wallet to be able to claim weekly 3CRV rewards.

[03/05/2021 12:18 PM] j.#6352
i dont remember how to compute for it but i remember banteg mention the multiplier to crv somewhere in #🗣general. anyway, it's more profitable to go for the yearn vault, unless you dont mind doing everything manually


[03/05/2021 12:19 PM] j.#6352
it's also cheaper to buy on sushiswap than to deposit your crv to the vault directly


[03/05/2021 12:22 PM] lavmorc#4542
thanks! you mean: cheaper to swap CRV for yveCRV on sushi then deposit? that's a great tip, thanks.


[03/05/2021 12:24 PM] j.#6352
yup. depositing crv in the yearn vault gives you 1:1 yvecrv. yvecrv on sushiswap is currently $1.81 while crv is $2.07

Hi folks, I have a technical question (from a newbie!), how does yearn calculate how much 3crv rewards you are eligible to? What if I want to deploy a contract that holds my yveCRV and claim the rewards automatically, would that be possible? I'm trying to learn solidity but I need a use case that motivates me, otherwise I'll be soon finishing the "hello world" tutorial in the ethereum blockchain and then that's it.

Question 22:
What is yveCRV, and what can we do with it?
Answer:
yveCRV is the Yearn veCRV Backscratcher Vault token. The vault eternally locks user-deposited CRV, which is used to boost the various Yearn vaults with Curve strategies. In return, Curve fees, paid in 3CRV, that Yearn would have earned from weekly claims are given to those users. yveCRV may be deposited in the WETH-yveCRV pool in Sushiswap, and then staked in Onsen to earn SUSHI. WETH-yveCRV SLP may also be deposited in Pickle Jar, then staked to earn PICKLE. Depositing and staking in Sushiswap or Pickle will not allow you to claim the weekly 3CRV rewards. yveCRV must be held in your wallet to be able to claim weekly 3CRV rewards.


[03/08/2021 3:39 PM] ONI#6888
You can only stake at either pickle or sushi


[03/08/2021 3:46 PM] doger#9213
oh thank you, looks like SUSHI is the better option, but don't you think the site should say you could stake on either sites?


[03/08/2021 3:47 PM] doger#9213
Also, it says "joining the sushi pool gets you sushi rewards". But you only get sushi rewards if you stake the LPs right?


[03/08/2021 3:49 PM] doger#9213
Also, where could I calculate the 3CRV weekly reward predictions? So I know if staking is even worth it?

Hey guys a bit  new to this whole concept, if I depost USDC into the USDC V2 vault, i should in turn get yUSDC, which later i would withdraw back for USDC + growth, is that underlying, basic 'use' concept?


[03/08/2021 5:01 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
yes


[03/08/2021 5:01 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
and growth will be in the form of more USDC


[03/08/2021 5:05 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
got it, thank you


[03/08/2021 5:23 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
other question, so i understand if I deposit into the USDC vault there is a 2% management fee and  a 20% performance fee, is that direct to me or shared across the entire vault?


[03/08/2021 5:25 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
Trying to understand from a practical sense, like its a direct hit to me right at the get go, like if I were to deposit and then immediately withdraw would there be a 22% reduction in what i deposited


[03/08/2021 5:44 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
No.  It’s 2 percent per annum.  So if you invested for 1 year in the vault you would lose 2% and 20% of profits only.  If you invested 10k for 1 year and it earned 20% you would pay 200 in 2% aum fee and 400 in promote fee so 10,000 plus 2,000 of gains less 600 in fees


[03/08/2021 5:44 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
This is simple math and doesn’t account for compounding but should give you an idea

Hey guys I've got some feedback for you. 

My background: I'm not a complete noob, been buying BTC for the first time in 2014, dabbled around a bit and returned almost full time since late summer. I've been using farms, been LPing, I've got somewhat of an understanding of IL, I've used L2 chains, etc.. I'm spending most of my time reading / learning / trading these days.

Here's the thing: I don't entirely get yearn 😄 Just as an example, the first pool I see when opening yearn.finance is:

"This vault converts your CRV into yveCRV, earning you a continuous share of Curve fees. The more converted, the greater the rewards. Every week, these can be claimed from the vault as 3Crv (Curve’s 3pool LP token)."

This text introduces a whole bunch of variables and assumes prior knowledge that maybe less people have than you think. What does the "yve" stand for? What's the Curve 3Pool LP token? How does converting earn fees?

Of course this may be irrelevant if you're not looking to target lesser apes like me, just thought I'd leave this here. I'd be happy to do some user testing / more detailed feedback IF you're keen on onboarding a greater diversity of users outside the advanced / dev-level..

The vault page lists an array of vaults that you can invest in.  All of the vaults that have crv in front of them farm curve tokens from the curve liquidity pools.  the v2 vaults are more token specific have one or more underlying strategies to generate returns on that token.  The yve vault is a special vault that you can deposit crv tokens to lock them as vecrv (vote escrowed) which gives you a better yield than you would get doing it directly with curve and provides the boost that yearn uses on its vaults (if you hover over the curve yvaults you will see a boost between 1.00 and 2.50x owed to the assets in the vecrv vault).  The yveCRV (y is the yearn vault identifier)  the ve is really vecrv which is vote escrowed crv @Bang


[03/08/2021 9:27 PM] mohseng#7930
Does APY of some percentage refer to the dollar value of the investment?  For example for sETH, does an APY of 1500% mean my 1 SETH will become 15 SETH?


[03/08/2021 9:35 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
yes, but more accurately 15 LP tokens which should approx the same value since unlikely to be IL in curve pools

What are YEARN VAULTS? ETH Vault Explained | DEFI, YIELD FARMING
So what are Yearn Vaults all about? Also, how does the ETH Vault work under the hood and how can it bring over 60% returns?  We’ll go through all of this in this video.

Yearn Vaults, in essence, are pools of funds with an associated strategy for maximising returns on the asset in the vault. Vault strategies are more active than just lending out...

[03/08/2021 11:01 PM] mohseng#7930
thanks. but what's IL, illiquid?  So you are saying if the pools are liquid, I will have 15 ETH for each ETH. wow.

[03/08/2021 11:02 PM] mohseng#7930
so I'll get 15 eth


[03/08/2021 11:02 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
you'll get an LP token worth 50% ETH and 50% sETH that you can redeem for ETH or sETH


[03/08/2021 11:02 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
effectively yes


[03/08/2021 11:03 PM] mohseng#7930
15 of them for each


[03/08/2021 11:03 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
yes, but 1500% APYs are hard to come by for significant periods of time

hey more of a nuanced question, so i depost USDC, get YUSD, then withdraw by effectively burning by yUSD, but how are the earnings computed, like how does it know to add interest back to my specific wallet address, is it just a custom contract on the fly based on eth addres and like a time stamp?


[03/09/2021 12:06 AM] DynamicalJon#4035
and like what if i deposit USDC today, and then more USDC in two weeks, how does it know which APY to give me back...


[03/09/2021 12:19 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
Your yusdc represent shares in the vault.  You get your proportionate share based on the entry calc.

On yearn.finance it shows you how much in the deposit token you have if you withdrew, and it should grow over time. That is your yield. We are working on ways to better visualize this.

Haven't heard of that… Try hard-refresh the web-interface or try a different one, like yearn.fi
Otherwise, if you're familiar with etherscan, you could withdraw directly from there using the withdraw or withdrawAll function : https://etherscan.io/address/0xBA2E7Fed597fd0E3e70f5130BcDbbFE06bB94fe1#writeContract

I did it but now I am stuck, I am a newbie, can you please just tell me how do I stake them into the YVault? I went on yearn.finance and try to deposit them from there, the first transaction worked but afterwards the second trans..was very high like 1.5 Eth, is that possible, seems a way too high...


[03/09/2021 8:16 AM] Mélen#4878
is there any difference between the to (on how they interact with the contracts), apart from one being the official one and the other showing all the experiments? Thanks mate 😉


[03/09/2021 8:20 AM] j.#6352
Have you unstaked from Curve gauge? You should now be holding the LP token for the Curve Y pool. You can then deposit that in the Y Vault in Yearn. I dont know why gas is over 1 ETH. You can also try withdrawing/exiting the Curve Y pool into any stablecoin you want then just buy the yUSD vault token on Uniswap or Sushiswap. It might be cheaper in gas that way. yUSD is the same as the Yearn Y Vault token


[03/09/2021 8:26 AM] Fredpaper#8845
Yes I did and tried to deposit them in Yearn but the Gas was crazy so I declined, shame I didn't know yUSD is the same I would have tried that way, this is becoming a bit tricky for me...thanks for your time

[03/09/2021 9:36 AM] Mélen#4878
What browser are you using? sometimes Brave's own metamask fails to correctly estimate the gas, maybe try with chrome or firefox


[03/09/2021 9:39 AM] Fredpaper#8845
Chrome on Mac...maybe ETH is just very much congested and getting very expensive to deal through, by the way the process to deposit is the right one?Thanks


[03/09/2021 10:18 AM] Mélen#4878
yes exactly, but I guess what's happening is that your wallet is estimating the amount of gas necessary wrongly

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8fad0f9772e57383c17f7611a5ccf706c893651ba7126a0ff8e6212d27ca8120 If you check this transaction for example, which happened 3 hours ago, the contract required a bit less than 100k gas, so try and figure out what you wallet is suggesting, it may be over-evaluating. Setting it to 200k-250k gas should be enough, ethereum will only use whats necessary and you'll see what amount has actually been used when the transaction confirms. 
You set a maximum amount that the tx is allowed to use, but it usually won't use the full amount, you'll only be charge what's been used, which in that case was 81k gas

On site it says to create the LP for SUSHI rewards... But I am pretty sure staking is required for sushi rewards, thus staking on pickle would not be allowed... Right?


[03/09/2021 4:49 PM] j.#6352
After depositing for LP on Sushiswap, you can only stake on one, Sushiswap or Pickle. Not both


[03/09/2021 4:50 PM] doger#9213

[03/09/2021 4:52 PM] j.#6352

[03/09/2021 4:52 PM] doger#9213
Do you still also get the initial CRV percent or multiplier?

yes. no need to bother with it if youre more interested with farming sushi

Is it 84.79% ROI if I don't stake the LP?


[03/09/2021 4:58 PM] j.#6352
im gonna guess that it's the apy from pickle


[03/09/2021 4:58 PM] doger#9213
Is this specific example above referring to sushi?


[03/09/2021 4:58 PM] j.#6352
it says in step 3


[03/09/2021 4:59 PM] j.#6352
no. going that route will put your tokens in pickle


[03/09/2021 4:59 PM] doger#9213
ok so the only LP possible for yveCRV is on Sushi right?


[03/09/2021 4:59 PM] j.#6352
yes the pool is in Sushiswap


[03/09/2021 4:59 PM] doger#9213
Pickle is showing 70% on their site


[03/09/2021 5:00 PM] doger#9213
Do you think the 84% represents the LP token growth?


[03/09/2021 5:00 PM] j.#6352
lp fees should be included in the pickle apy too


[03/09/2021 5:01 PM] j.#6352
if you point your cursor on the 70% you should see its individual parts


[03/09/2021 5:01 PM] j.#6352
pickle 10.84% sushi 58.92% lp 0.97%


[03/09/2021 5:01 PM] doger#9213
oh interesting, they are giving 58% sushi rewards, but if you go direct with sushi its like 140%


[03/09/2021 5:02 PM] doger#9213
I guess the only thing I do not understand is why this is showing 84.49% growth

{Embed}
Question 22:
What is yveCRV, and what can we do with it?
Answer:
yveCRV is the Yearn veCRV Backscratcher Vault token. The vault eternally locks user-deposited CRV, which is used to boost the various Yearn vaults with Curve strategies. In return, Curve fees, paid in 3CRV, that Yearn would have earned from weekly claims are given to those users. yveCRV may be deposited in the WETH-yveCRV pool in Sushiswap, and then staked in Onsen to earn SUSHI. WETH-yveCRV SLP may also be deposited in Pickle Jar, then staked to earn PICKLE. Depositing and staking in Sushiswap or Pickle will not allow you to claim the weekly 3CRV rewards. yveCRV must be held in your wallet to be able to claim weekly 3CRV rewards.


[03/09/2021 5:27 PM] Kneel#2498
I think the sushi rewards include the 2/3 unvested whereas the pickle only compounds on the the vested 1/3

Vested SUSHI Rewards for Pickle Finance
Intro Hi SushiSwap community! Larry the founder of Pickle Finance here - long time lurker on these forums but first time posting.  I understand that voting for SIMP#3 passed in favor of Option 2, where the 2/3rd vested SUSHI rewards may be withheld from certain smart contracts. Obviously it would be in Sushi’s best interest to prevent certain pr...

[03/09/2021 6:32 PM] vany#0365
Correct 84% is only counting 1/3 sushi + pickle rewards


[03/09/2021 6:43 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
is there a way for me to find the actual accurate return for the USDC vault? I know the 25% is not quite accurate


[03/09/2021 8:42 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
https://yearn-finance.vercel.app/stats - i found this


[03/09/2021 8:44 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
This is a test UI site.  The returns on that page are not accurate


[03/09/2021 8:46 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
The returns on the yearn finance vaults page should be accurate.  The 25% is a gross number based on weekly compounding of returns


[03/09/2021 8:46 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
Gross = before fees.  If you hover over the return you can see the net return


[03/09/2021 8:48 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
got it!


[03/09/2021 8:49 PM] vany#0365
official sites are in #🔗links


[03/09/2021 10:00 PM] DOZΞ#4287
Hey everyone, can someone point me to resources that explain how vault payouts work? I entered the crvLINK vault yesterday, and figured it would take some time to earn rewards, but I used the Feel the Yearn site and saw I did already begin earning, but the rate wasn't anywhere close to the 67.88% listed on the vault.


[03/09/2021 10:34 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
It doesn't accrue ratably at 68%.  The rate is based on when the strategy harvests crv which may be several times a day or only once every few days.  The crvLINK vault is a smaller vault so it may not harvest more than once per day.  Think of it as your money earn crv rewards and pool fees but you only see it when the strategy claims it which it does using K3PR network to optimize and automate claiming.    For example if the strat harvested on 3/8 at 11:59pm and you enter at 3/9 at 1:00 am and the strategy doesn't harvest next until 3/10 its going to look like you are earning 0%.  It will take a couple of harvests before you start to match the APY listed on the site as that is calc'd based on I think the average of the last 10 harvests.  Also the 67.88% number is the gross return assuming weekly compounding and the current net amount (after fees) is 47.70%


[03/09/2021 10:36 PM] DOZΞ#4287
Thanks @HAtTip3675, that was incredibly helpful!


[03/10/2021 12:17 AM] Interl0per#0314
So I've been in the vault 2 days now and I see that the vault is updating twice a day... the average apy based on the 2 days since I've been in there is ~21%... I'm going to give it a week for the apy to even out


[03/10/2021 12:18 AM] Interl0per#0314
Thanks for the help @HAtTip3675, I read through all your comments to others... we have to be patient while the vault does its magic


[03/10/2021 6:31 AM] DynamicalJon#4035
hey guys how often are the earnings themselves updated and available for withdrawal from the vaults, every mined block or does it depend on the vault? If  so what is it for the USDC and YFI v2 vaults, thanks


[03/10/2021 9:48 AM] Mélen#4878
The vaults earn rewards and sells it back for the underlying every time the harvest() function is called. The team appears to be working on an interface that would more clearly show it but for now I don’t know


[03/10/2021 11:25 AM] reader31#9528
Hi guys,

How can I redeem v1 ydai to dai?


[03/10/2021 11:30 AM] reader31#9528
The v1 ydai UI on yearn.finance doesnt seem to work...


[03/10/2021 11:41 AM] ONI#6888
you're talking about the dai vault or?


[03/10/2021 11:43 AM] ONI#6888
anywhere from every few hours to once a week, but on v2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Generally its best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation but you are free to withdrawal whenever you want.


[03/10/2021 11:57 AM] Miles#3311
Can some advise on the "Epoch". What is it/How long does it last for.


[03/10/2021 11:57 AM] Miles#3311

hmm...actually this is the contract address of my ydai tokens...

https://etherscan.io/token/0x16de59092dae5ccf4a1e6439d611fd0653f0bd01

These tokens doesnt seem to be getting picked up in yearn vault UI

https://yearn.finance/vaults/0xACd43E627e64355f1861cEC6d3a6688B31a6F952

Do I have a different ydai token version than what the vault is expecting? I minted these many months ago...so not sure if the ydai contracts got updated or something due to the recent hack...appreciate your help with this.

[03/10/2021 1:41 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Stupid question of the day #2: What's the difference between SETH and STETH for those vaults? My end goal is I want exposure to ETH's price increases, but those don't quite make sense to me compared to a more simple wrapped ETH, is it a different wrapping? Or is it some weird token I'm unfamiliar with


[03/10/2021 1:41 PM] ONI#6888

Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for: extremely efficient stablecoin trading, low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.


[03/10/2021 1:42 PM] ONI#6888
seth is eth and synetic eth in a pool


[03/10/2021 1:42 PM] ONI#6888
steth is eth and lido dao steth the eth 2 token of theirs


[03/10/2021 1:43 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
and this is where we get into the 4D chess of investing that makes me feel not super comfortable.


[03/10/2021 1:45 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
WETH I think I understand way more, but its also less than half the return compared to SETH.


[03/10/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
you best bet is probably the seth vault


[03/10/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
its basically 100% eth


[03/10/2021 1:47 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
yea, I've been learning a lot. I hopped on the BDP bandwagon to get that return only to quickly realize I'd spend ~$70 to round trip depsoit/withdrawl (cause I do my damndest to wait for low gas) to make... $10 in BDP. Then I joined their telegram to try and get a sense of if I should dump it, and quickly lost all faith in their product because of who they chose to represent them in their official chat.


[03/10/2021 1:48 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
So pulled out the funds last night, and just realized "do the simple thing, place in a vault, and forget about it"


[03/10/2021 1:50 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Thanks as always for the help @ONI, you have been a super duper useful resource. Keep being awesome.


[03/10/2021 2:17 PM] ONI#6888
wow yah sadly it was only for a week


[03/10/2021 2:17 PM] ONI#6888
This is what I do with my stablecoin fund I just let it compound in a vault and dont worry about it


[03/10/2021 2:20 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Yea, plan now is half in stablecoin half in an eth vault, I’m bullish on ETH still


[03/10/2021 2:21 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Want exposure to its price value


[03/10/2021 2:22 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
But yea, I could of stayed in BDP another 2 days but pulled out last night when I saw their official reps in their telegrams act.... poorly

[03/10/2021 4:21 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
hey do the vaults actually compound your earnings or is the APY basically just based directly on the initial deposit?


[03/10/2021 4:28 PM] vany#0365
Yes vaults compound


[03/10/2021 5:09 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
So what am I missing here? By my math, 800usdc should be about 0.43 ETH. I'd be depositing half that. Is it using my USDC for transaction fees? Is there a way I can tell it not to and just use the ETH I have?

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734811808401063966/819300882352177152/unknown.png


[03/10/2021 6:06 PM] Mélen#4878
@Waffleophagus No USDC isn't used for the fees, but what is happening here is that 1 Vault share (the 0.2351 you'd be receiving) is worth roughly 1.8 ETH/sETH Curve LP Token → the token deposited into the Yearn Vault (1.834331495014302995 to be exact). So your  0.2351 shares of the vault are worth  0.2351x1.8=0.43 Curve LP tokens, worth around 0.43 ETH


[03/10/2021 6:07 PM] Mélen#4878
the pricePerShare (1.8) is from the vault function as of right now, this is because as the vault generates profit, the amount of vault shares you have in your wallet doesn't change, but the value of those shares increase, allowing you to redeem them for the underlying LP Token when you withdraw (or Zap out)


[03/10/2021 6:08 PM] Mélen#4878
Anyways, USDC is never used to pay gas fees on L1 Ethereum, only ETH can pay for it


[03/10/2021 6:15 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
yea, that's what I thought, I had read a thing somewhere that USDC could pay for transactions... I suppose I was totally wrong.


[03/10/2021 6:16 PM] Mélen#4878
Yeah not basic gas fee to process transactions 😉 Only ETH for that


[03/10/2021 6:16 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Ok, now to just wait for gas to not suck to deposit.


[03/10/2021 6:17 PM] Mélen#4878
haha yeah, it a big issue right now…


[03/10/2021 6:17 PM] Mélen#4878
Try to use tools like https://gasnow.org to view current gas price as well as a history of gas prices over a week to figure out the best moment for you to submit the transaction

[03/10/2021 6:18 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Oh yea for sure! I actually wrote a little console program that tracks the gas now rates and sends me a push notification when its low.


[03/10/2021 6:18 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
and am very likely going to start looking at tracking it myself and see if I can find a trend to plan


[03/10/2021 6:18 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
like "its usually slow on tuesday nights" or something


[03/10/2021 6:19 PM] Mélen#4878
it usually is lower during weekends, especially in the morning in Europe when Asia and America is sleeping


[03/10/2021 6:20 PM] Mélen#4878
but you'll get that kind of data down bellow in the gasnow page


[03/10/2021 6:20 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Yea, I find if I have the data myself I can manipulate it


[03/10/2021 6:20 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
better


[03/10/2021 6:22 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
to me, their charts less than helpful. Like the data is clear, but I wanna look at the carts with different variables. Like "How long does it stay below 80 gwei, and when"


[03/10/2021 6:22 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
for instance


[03/10/2021 6:23 PM] Mélen#4878
tools probably exist, but hey, making it yourself will always be better suited for your needs, plus you gain experience 😉


[03/10/2021 6:23 PM] Mélen#4878
most gas trackers have free APIs you can use for that matter


[03/10/2021 6:24 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
yea, my biggest goal with this was to actually have it send a pre-signed transaction when the gas reaches a certain point. That's still an end goal I think, but its really just learning how to code for the world of crypto.


[03/10/2021 6:24 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Yep, I'm using the gasnow api


[03/10/2021 6:24 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
once every 8 seconds, their update interval


[03/10/2021 6:24 PM] Mélen#4878
Hopefully everything will become more predictable with EIP1559 this summer


[03/10/2021 6:24 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
yea, then I'll probably shift it to "notify me when transaction prices are lowest"


[03/10/2021 6:24 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
instead of gas


[03/10/2021 6:25 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
assuming the APIs shift to tracking that


[03/10/2021 6:25 PM] Mélen#4878
they most certainly will


[03/10/2021 6:27 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
This was all leading up to me probably learning solidity


[03/10/2021 6:27 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
this stuff was able to be written in my native (programming) languages


[03/10/2021 6:27 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
so it was my happy place


[03/10/2021 6:28 PM] Mélen#4878
Learning solidity is always a good idea, but look into Vyper if you're familiar with Python, it's also pretty interesting 😉


[03/10/2021 6:28 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
I'm a C# guy.


[03/10/2021 6:28 PM] Mélen#4878
The end goal being mastering the two


[03/10/2021 6:29 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Although there is actually a library that allows you to write C# that it transforms into solidity


[03/10/2021 6:29 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
so I may start there, and then have someone that knows what they're doing review it.


[03/10/2021 6:30 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
I haven't done python since college, which was.... *checks calendar* longer than I'd care to admit.


[03/10/2021 6:30 PM] Mélen#4878
Haha, well, the important part is trying so yeah, start somewhere and see where it leads you


[03/10/2021 6:33 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
well for me, personally, I need an idea. My motivation comes from "Oh I wanna build this cool thing." not "I wanna learn this language."


[03/10/2021 6:33 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
so once I come up with an idea for a good smart contract, i'll probably learn solidity in short order


[03/11/2021 12:18 AM] underthesea#4658
Is there any chance USDC v1 will have more than $20k on the contract at any point in the future or is it a stable balance?  I need to withdraw a wee bit more at once and the fees ouchy.


[03/11/2021 4:18 AM] ONI#6888
im seeing it has 18.6k free right now


[03/11/2021 4:18 AM] ONI#6888
you should be able to take out 18 or 15k without a fee


[03/11/2021 4:18 AM] ONI#6888

you can withdraw only the amount you want, or max which is the original with rewards

[03/11/2021 10:36 AM] EC#6224
appologize for my lame question - but is it even concidered stakeign what I just did... or is it simply holding the asset without actual staking it and earning rewards ...


[03/11/2021 10:50 AM] underthesea#4658
Now it looks like there is $1.   Withdrawing smaller amounts doesn’t help because of gas fee.  My question Is:  is it possible if I wait that the contract will have more than $25k available and I can get it all in one transaction?


[03/11/2021 11:08 AM] EC#6224
@j. can you validate this is indeed staked? According to the image I sent above


[03/11/2021 11:12 AM] underthesea#4658
AFAIK:  Yearn does staking for you.   You only deposit and withdraw.

So you’re saying there’s a chance 😃. Thanks.  Kinda squeezing me out of V1 here as performance degrades, but the added gas or withdraw fee really whap me over the head for $25k deposit


[03/11/2021 11:41 AM] j.#6352
if you mean yfi deposited in the vault, then yes. you should be earning more yfi


[03/11/2021 11:47 AM] EC#6224
Thank you for your help. What is the purpose of yvYFI ?
For example: I deposited 0.25, than would I will withdraw, I will receive 0.27 of the same token? 
Where the additional 0.02 are the earning? - is that correct?


[03/11/2021 11:52 AM] j.#6352
it constantly increases in value as shown by its 'price per share'. so yfi does not equal yvyfi. it 'represents' your deposit's value at the time of deposit

Hello need an admins help. How do I check how much rewards I’ve gotten in the last 12 hours from Yearns crvLINK vault


[03/11/2021 12:04 PM] Deleted User#0000

[03/11/2021 1:13 PM] Mélen#4878
but the rewards are updated when the vault performs harvest (the action of claiming the CRV and then selling it back for more LINK/sLINK LP to put back into the vault)

Question about v2 YFI vault. Does the interest come from yearn trading fees? I'm wondering how fluctuated is the growth% gonna be for long term.


[03/11/2021 7:30 PM] vany#0365
Any gas fee is due to the ethereum network and none of that goes to yearn. Gas is extremely high right now >200 gwei. Likely why you are seeing such a high estimate

If you hold yveCRV, how do you get your weekly earnings?


[03/12/2021 12:43 AM] jdsp#4710
Assuming you haven't staked your yveCRV on sushiswap, you can claim the 3Crv rewards from https://crv.ape.tax/


[03/12/2021 1:19 AM] Jonathan!#8362
@Unknown Thanks, I have not staked on SS, if I had then SS claims them?


[03/12/2021 2:35 AM] jdsp#4710
I don't think it does at the moment, I could be wrong about that


[03/12/2021 2:54 AM] ONI#6888
it will drop significantly soon as the data protocol its farming will stop its LM program


[03/12/2021 2:55 AM] ONI#6888
we are working on a way to view your yield in our v3 ui update but it is not out yet and there is no good way to visualize this currently


[03/12/2021 5:12 AM] zodiark#1534
Thank you for responding to my question. Possible to know how many coins are expected to be mined/bought back in the LM program? Just trying to figure out if swapping and depositing some more YFI will be worth the cost. If LM program ends within a week, it probably isn't worth it.


[03/12/2021 7:00 AM] ONI#6888
it ends today I think so I doubt it is worth it


[03/12/2021 7:00 AM] ONI#6888
that is to say you wont be getting 100% apy on those coins maybe 5% or something


[03/12/2021 7:00 AM] ONI#6888
generally YFI apy isnt that high

Question 22:
What is yveCRV, and what can we do with it?
Answer:
yveCRV is the Yearn veCRV Backscratcher Vault token. The vault eternally locks user-deposited CRV, which is used to boost the various Yearn vaults with Curve strategies. In return, Curve fees, paid in 3CRV, that Yearn would have earned from weekly claims are given to those users. yveCRV may be deposited in the WETH-yveCRV pool in Sushiswap, and then staked in Onsen to earn SUSHI. WETH-yveCRV SLP may also be deposited in Pickle Jar, then staked to earn PICKLE. Depositing and staking in Sushiswap or Pickle will not allow you to claim the weekly 3CRV rewards. yveCRV must be held in your wallet to be able to claim weekly 3CRV rewards.


[03/12/2021 9:07 AM] j.#6352
Depositing CRV into Yearn helps Yearn boost the Curve-based vaults. In return for that favor, Yearn passes to you their claim on Curve fees, which are in the form of 3crv


[03/12/2021 9:08 AM] 1422wo#6100
Do you get 3crv once a week


[03/12/2021 9:08 AM] j.#6352
Yes


[03/12/2021 9:09 AM] 1422wo#6100
Does 3crv have to be in the wallet to get a reward?


[03/12/2021 9:09 AM] j.#6352
But you dont have to claim weekly if you just plan on holding. You can let the 3crv accrue and then claim it whenever you want in the future


[03/12/2021 9:09 AM] j.#6352
yveCRV has to be in your wallet to get the 3crv reward

How to view apy


[03/12/2021 9:18 AM] j.#6352
I dont think ive seen it displayed anywhere. It's a weekly claim on Curve and it changes all the time. Interpolating that into APY might not make sense


[03/12/2021 9:19 AM] j.#6352
I might be wrong though. Check the website and the ape.tax one, but i havent seen it shown


[03/12/2021 9:24 AM] 1422wo#6100
Is it from the moment of offering until a week later that we can see the benefits?


[03/12/2021 9:31 AM] j.#6352
I dont understand. Sorry. Curve releases rewards on thursday and it's available on Yearn some hours later or Friday. Not sure. I just let mine sit in there


[03/12/2021 9:51 AM] EC#6224
Hi again support team. 
I'm still struggeling to understand where can I see the earned rewards on my transaction.
I depositied 0.28YFI (about $10K), and recivered a yvFYI token in return.

I couldn't find any ROI calculator that showed my holdings and returns... could anyone recommand where can I see that?

in the etherscan page of the vault, click Contract, click Read Contract, Click pricePerShare, multiply that number by your deposited amount. you'll have to put a decimal point somewhere

Hi, I have a question. I have 0.96eth in eth v1 vault. When I try to migrate metamask asks me 0.44 eth gas fee. Why is that happening? What do I do wrong?


[03/12/2021 5:26 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
gas fees are pretty high right now at > 200 gwei


[03/12/2021 5:27 PM] kivanc#1035
even though it is high, is it normal to ask half of my ether?


[03/12/2021 5:31 PM] kivanc#1035
withdraw all is around 0.013eth. Migrate all is 0.37eth. It doesnt make sense to me


[03/12/2021 5:34 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
Why not try withdraw all and then deposit into the new v2 vault.  If the withdraw is only .013 eth that seems pretty inexpensive


[03/12/2021 5:34 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
if the deposit it .37 then prob not worth doing it


[03/12/2021 5:34 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
the v1 vault is going to be wound down soon and won't be earning much of anything

[03/12/2021 5:41 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
the vault takes any earning and reinvests them into more YFI so when you eventually withdraw (whenever that is) you get out more YFI than you put in


[03/12/2021 5:42 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
they are working on a ui to better see it

ok great thanks for answering....so i dont actually see any earnings accrued or even know how much i have earned....yep i rekon somewhere to see that would be great...like on aave or bancor, one can see in real time what rewards/interest they have earned.  thanks again for answering...any idea when the new ui might show that?

I have a question about the best approach to depositing into the crvLink vault. It looks like Zapper.fi is the best option if I want do directly deposit Link. Will that route work? Are there any other ways that I might not know about? The Yearn.finance protocol doesnt seem to detect Link as a valid token for deposit. Thanks


[03/12/2021 6:08 PM] Mr Bellows#2927
Maybe it just hasn't detected it because I hadn't "approved" it 🤔

i think you only did the approval transaction. if this is your first time interacting with the vault/contract, you have to do two transactions: one for approval, and one for the actual deposit

So I know that the community tools for ROI/APY are not necessarily written by anyone here, and it may be that I'm too early to check them (I only deposited 3 days ago, but have seen reasonable gains in that time) but none of the tools show my holdings. yieldfarming.info doesn't appear to know data on the vault I chose, yearn.party is just all zeros after connecting, and feel the yearn shows nothing when I connect, just this:

generally when in a vault yes but the problem is there are only two decimals on the yfi number so probably not

hi - I've deposited money in the Yearn Curve aDAI/aUSDC/aUSDT Vault and the Yearn Curve aDAI/aSUSD Vault a few days ago.
I've been keeping track of my YVA3CRV tokens and my A3CRV tokens. Both haven't increased since yesterday evening. Is this expected behaviour? Or am I doing something wrong?

Thank you - I get that this is why I don't get more YVA3CRV tokens for the "Curve aDAI/aUSDC/aUSDT Vault". But for that same Vault, I thought I could see my increasing returns by checking how many A3CRV tokens I now have the right to.


[03/14/2021 2:41 PM] tobias#8278
Is that not the case? If so, how can I check my actual returns?

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[03/14/2021 3:04 PM] j.#6352

Why is the gas limit (not the gwei) so fucking high to withdraw from the alink vault?


[03/14/2021 6:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also the UI doesn't seem to show the correct total amount in the various vault (ie the amount is not increasing like it should) so I don't know how much to withdraw. When will this be fixed?


[03/14/2021 7:47 PM] 0xDragon#1826
Guys, on other platforms where i year interest, it shows the rewards separately. Yearn only displaces deposited amount. I don't see where rewards are shown, perhaps it accrues on the deposit amount, if so I haven't seen it increase. Is there a 3rd party site where I can track earnings?


[03/14/2021 10:49 PM] DynamicalJon#4035
Do you know if there are UI enhancements coming for that by chance?


[03/15/2021 2:24 AM] bb11840#2785
Hi everyone! I'm very new to Yearn and vaults and could use some help depositing some ethereum into the yveCRV - ETH vault. Metamask is recommending I use .1 ETH on gas to depost .1 ETH into the vault which I know can't be right. But when I set the gas price equal to what I see on ethgasstation for an instant transaction (161 GWEI) and set a gas limit of 21000, I run out of gas too quickly. Any advice?


[03/15/2021 2:29 AM] j.#6352
dont change the gas limit. 21000 gas limit is only for basic ETH transfers. What youre doing is a more complex transaction involving more data in contracts. just use the gas limit set by metamask, but youre free to change the gas price


[03/15/2021 2:33 AM] bb11840#2785
Oh, I see. So even if metamask says I need .1 ETH (~$190) with the default gas limit to complete the transaction, I should just accept it?


[03/15/2021 2:34 AM] j.#6352
yes


[03/15/2021 2:34 AM] j.#6352
dont set your gas price too low

Hi guys, I have a quick question, i tried searching to see if this had come up before but couldn't find anything.

I've had some USDC deposited in the USDC yVault v2 for the last few weeks. Within the yearn.finance/vaults/ UI I could see my portfolio balance going up every day but last few days my balance has stayed the same, any ideas why?


[03/15/2021 9:00 AM] 0xDragon#1826
Hi like the above ^ I have a similiar issue, staked USDC but the balance isn't increasing, tbf its has only been a day...... but I would have expected at least a 0.01 increase based on the amount I have deposited.... My WETH hasn't increased at all either and that has been a week

So this isn't exactly yearn related, but I figure you guys would know. My metamask isn't showing my yearn tokens at all, I went in and added them using this contract: 0x5f18c75abdae578b483e5f43f12a39cf75b973a9 and it *still* isn't appearing. If I try to add it again it says "its already been added"


[03/15/2021 1:02 PM] Mélen#4878
when you first added the custom token to metamask did it said how much yvUSDC you had ? before confirming


[03/15/2021 1:13 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
It said 0


[03/15/2021 1:14 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Did I use the wrong contract address?


[03/15/2021 1:20 PM] Mélen#4878
for yvUSDC no, it's the right one, but are you sure to be deposited in that vault ? On the Yearn website you can clic on the name of the vault to open the etherscan page of that vauklt. From here, you'll be able to copy/paste the contract address into metamask

I’ve been checking gas costs to try to pull my eth out of the inactive vault for the last few days. Currently over $700 to pull out 1 eth. Lowest I’ve seen it was a couple days ago at $228 but waited in hopes of getting it below $200 but ever since it’s been $500+. Guess I should’ve pulled the trigger. Such a nightmare

Hello, I'm new here and have a quick question: Via metamask, I've deposit some yfi into the YFI v2 vault... how do I check how much I've earned from the vault? and is there anything I need to do to claim the earnings? Thanks!


[03/16/2021 6:39 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
easiest way currently to tell how much you've made is to look at yearn.finance and see what your share currently is, and subtract your deposit.


[03/16/2021 6:40 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
I've found that Zerion has consistently been good at telling you the "underlying asset" too if you want that


[03/16/2021 6:40 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
There are also a host of tools listed under #🔗links  but I personally haven't gotten much luck from them


[03/16/2021 6:41 PM] CryptoFiendDave#4871
awesome thank you!


[03/16/2021 6:45 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
worth noting on the likes of Zerion, their dollar amount for my assets (USDC) its usually wrong, but the amount of underlying assets (the count of the coin) is spot on.


[03/16/2021 6:47 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
For instance, it says my 801.476 USDC is worth $807.59 which... isn't correct. But it does translate my ~780 yvUSDC into the underlying 801.476 USDC well.

I'm not sure if this an issue for the bot or the learnyearn.finance site, but I wanted to make somebody aware that In question 11 from @ yfi-faq-bot  (How does yearn.finance make money?) it says more info can be found at: https://www.learnyearn.finance/start-here/yfi-revenue-model but that page is 404


[03/17/2021 5:00 AM] ONI#6888
I think what you seeing on metamask is withdrawal of 0 ETH. your not withdrawing eth but yvWETH


[03/17/2021 5:00 AM] ONI#6888
so it shows 0, ie metamask isnt good at showing balances of erc20 tokens


[03/17/2021 5:01 AM] ONI#6888
if you have a v1 eth balance and hit withdrawal or withdrawal all just sent the transaction and it will go through even if it says 0 eth


[03/17/2021 5:01 AM] grumbly#4193
Hi Oni, thanks for the response.  When I'm looking at the vaults on yearn.finance I'm seeing I have the same deposited amounts in WETH v1 and ETH V1


[03/17/2021 5:02 AM] grumbly#4193
So I'm assuming I can just pull from ETH V1?


[03/17/2021 5:04 AM] grumbly#4193
should I be withdrawing it from WETH v1 or ETH v1 or does it not matter?  (They're both showing an identical balance under Deposited)

I tried to enter into a smart contract for the yveCRV - ETH vault, however, the smart contract was taking too long, so I decided to cancel it. The cancel said it was successful, bu the ETH was not returned to my metamask wallet. Is this transaction still pending somehow?


[03/17/2021 2:07 PM] j.#6352
An address can only do one transaction at a time. If the cancel transaction was successful, you should have your ETH untouched, minus what was spent for gas


[03/17/2021 2:09 PM] thomasku11#3486
okay, in other words, one of the earlier sequential transactions is still pending, so the most recent cancellation could not be executed. Is that correct?


[03/17/2021 2:14 PM] j.#6352
You said that the cancel transaction was confirmed no? If so, the deposit transaction would never have happened


[03/17/2021 2:14 PM] j.#6352
because cancelling replaces a previously sent out transaction


[03/17/2021 2:19 PM] thomasku11#3486
it says it was cancelled however funds are not back in the metamask wallet

"This vault is no longer active. Withdraw funds or migrate your balance to the v2 WETH yVault to continue earning yield. Please be advised that withdrawal fees of 0.5-1% may apply for large migrations." I'm glad there is a migration button now, but how do I know whether fees will be deducted?

How are management fees calculated for v2 vaults? Is it 20% of the total profit or 20% of the entire pool size?


[03/18/2021 5:39 PM] arberx#3367
20% of profits


[03/19/2021 3:08 AM] Mateo#5403
I can't find any UI to withdraw from the  yearn governance contract (all I can see is that governance is on snapshot now).  0xBa37B002AbaFDd8E89a1995dA52740bbC013D992  Can someone share the link?


[03/19/2021 3:53 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
same issue


[03/19/2021 4:05 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140

[03/19/2021 4:05 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
I am just feeling really dumb


[03/19/2021 4:06 AM] ONI#6888
this isnt the official site so not sure if its fully working or not


[03/19/2021 4:06 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
I originally tried the old one


[03/19/2021 4:06 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
Then I tried taking my colalteral out


[03/19/2021 4:06 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
all 4 TXNs failed


[03/19/2021 4:06 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
well they went thro


[03/19/2021 4:06 AM] ONI#6888
for ironbank afaik if someone is borrowing you cannot withdrawal


[03/19/2021 4:07 AM] ONI#6888
borrowing your funds


[03/19/2021 4:07 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
there was available liquidity


[03/19/2021 4:07 AM] ONI#6888
but im not 100% sure you should ask cream in their chat


[03/19/2021 4:07 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
for me to withdraw and borrow it's just not working atm idk why


[03/19/2021 4:07 AM] ONI#6888
it is really cream v2


[03/19/2021 4:07 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
I need to switch to the bsc one


[03/19/2021 4:08 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
How will I know when it's working again?


[03/19/2021 7:17 AM] Anton#9785
Yo, what is not working with your lending?


[03/19/2021 9:41 AM] EC#6224
Hi support team, I made a deposit 10 days ago, where can I see the current value of my tokens? (it's just showing 0.29, which is about $10,000). Is there a way to see the changes over time?

the ui only displays two decimal places for now. this will be changed. see other calculators and dashboards on #🔗links, and also zapper, zerion, and debank


[03/19/2021 9:44 AM] EC#6224
none of them shows my deposit

[03/19/2021 12:22 PM] dylanmeza#2536
@arberx actual scam or just scam since it has similar name?


[03/19/2021 12:24 PM] arberx#3367
99% chance a scam. Using yearns name is a huge red flag


[03/19/2021 12:25 PM] arberx#3367
I personally haven’t look at it, so dyor


[03/19/2021 12:25 PM] arberx#3367
But I wouldn’t touch it


[03/19/2021 12:25 PM] dylanmeza#2536
alright thanks appreciate it, got in during presale and added a little after but starting to see some red flags


[03/19/2021 12:25 PM] dylanmeza#2536
mind if i dm you real quick


[03/19/2021 12:26 PM] arberx#3367
Sure


[03/19/2021 12:26 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
anything that is not yearn using the yearn name is 99% scam.  if not scam likely poor quality ripoff


[03/19/2021 12:26 PM] arberx#3367
Presale also huge red flag


[03/19/2021 12:26 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
either way avoid at all costs


[03/19/2021 12:28 PM] Mateo#5403
How do I withdraw my YFI from yearn governance staking ?


[03/19/2021 12:32 PM] Mateo#5403
Is this the same as the old v1 YFI vault ?


[03/19/2021 12:40 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
no you can use https://ygov.rocks/


[03/19/2021 12:40 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
unless you meant the v1 YFI vault?


[03/19/2021 12:41 PM] Mateo#5403
I don't  think it's YFI vault.  I staked some YFI back in August,  and I  can't easily figure out how  to withdraw it


[03/19/2021 12:42 PM] Mateo#5403
But  thanks for the link I see  my balance now !


[03/19/2021 12:42 PM] Mateo#5403
Is there a link where we can see the description  of the new  YFI v2 vault ?   What  strategy it employs,  etc ?


[03/19/2021 12:49 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
they are adding strats, but main one will be deposit in maker, draw dai and send dai to yvdai vaults


[03/19/2021 12:49 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
i think maker needs to bump up yfi ai debt limit first before can scale


[03/19/2021 12:49 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
but they are working on adding strats and the treasury has 500 YFI in that vault too


[03/19/2021 4:15 PM] getrichslow.eth#7140
Whats wrong with iron bank guys


[03/19/2021 4:15 PM] getrichslow.eth#7140
what the fucks is going on


[03/19/2021 4:23 PM] arberx#3367
What’s wrong?


[03/19/2021 5:54 PM] defiderp69#6216
i did exactly the same thing lol


[03/19/2021 6:05 PM] kivanc#1035
Hi, I tried to "withdraw all" my eth from ETH V1 vault but still ETH is there. Is there a problem with Withdraw all button there? Does it put Balance 0 instead of all of the balance there?


[03/19/2021 6:05 PM] kivanc#1035
Is there a way to withdraw my money directly via smart contract isntead of website?


[03/19/2021 6:06 PM] ONI#6888
Should be working fine I can look into it


[03/19/2021 6:06 PM] ONI#6888
did it give you an error or just not go through?


[03/19/2021 6:06 PM] ONI#6888
or it went through just didnt do anything?


[03/19/2021 6:13 PM] kivanc#1035
@ONI thx for helping!


[03/19/2021 6:13 PM] ONI#6888
np


[03/19/2021 6:24 PM] Luc#6778
I have a question, what is put into place in the vaults to prevent liquidation (since vault strategies usually use leverage)? I heard that it's coded into the vault to fix the collateralisation ratio but how does it work?


[03/19/2021 6:27 PM] ONI#6888
the vaults the have a cdp


[03/19/2021 6:27 PM] ONI#6888
yfi v2 eth v2 link v1


[03/19/2021 6:28 PM] ONI#6888
keep a high ratio and afaik have a 1 hour window, thanks to maker, to know if they will be liquidate and fix it. The vault monitors is position and if the ratio drops too low, it is already set very high, it will auto payback to push the ratio to an acceptable level for the vault


[03/19/2021 6:28 PM] ONI#6888
also the strategists monitor all the cdps as well


[03/19/2021 6:29 PM] Luc#6778
so where does the money to do the payback come from? the liquidity in the vault itself?


[03/19/2021 6:30 PM] ONI#6888
the vault manages the debt


[03/19/2021 6:30 PM] ONI#6888
I dont have the specifics I would ask in #🧠strategies would be best and a strategist could answer

ok I see, I have one more question, about the iron bank and the zero collateral loans.... because i'm confused on how it can be possible, but i'll maybe ask in strategies too

yes

[03/19/2021 6:33 PM] ONI#6888
This is a refund for when people in yweth withdrew or migrated to v2 and were charged twice for fees because of how the vaults are set up

Hi, I deposited in a DAI vault last month and my balance has remained the same. I don't seem to be earning any interest. On yearn.finance I'm seeing all zeroes. I have a second ETH vault that has also not had any gains. What am I missing?


[03/20/2021 1:43 AM] arberx#3367
What does yearn.fi say


[03/20/2021 1:45 AM] arberx#3367
Should give you some stats, but not always accurate/support newer vaults


[03/20/2021 2:18 AM] 0xHye#8143
Ok I feel dumb. It says I’ve earned $9. I think I was expecting to see a bigger number. Thanks for the help!


[03/20/2021 2:19 AM] arberx#3367
lol that’s incorrect for sure.


[03/20/2021 2:19 AM] arberx#3367
You can search the chat for ways to calculate your earnings


[03/20/2021 2:19 AM] arberx#3367
Not a good way atm


[03/20/2021 2:23 AM] 0xHye#8143
I put in $1000. Would you expect to see more after 22 days?


[03/20/2021 2:25 AM] arberx#3367
Hmm depends on the allocation


[03/20/2021 2:25 AM] arberx#3367
But yeah I think so


[03/20/2021 2:26 AM] arberx#3367
That’s roughly a 3%APY, doesn’t sound right. Like I said yearn.fi isn’t accurate


[03/20/2021 2:31 AM] arberx#3367
You can search the chat for how to manually calculate using the share price


[03/20/2021 2:52 AM] 0xHye#8143
If that’s through looking at the smart contract then I’ve already tried that and see the same number as yearn.fi. Yeah it was definitely double digits APY, not 3%.


[03/20/2021 6:34 AM] ONI#6888
you have gains they are just hard to visualize currently


[03/20/2021 6:34 AM] ONI#6888
if you want to see you need to take your yvtoken amount * share price which will show you how much of the deposit token you have

[03/20/2021 4:59 PM] TranslucentMonkey#9147
Hello. I deposited some 1Inch into the V2 vault. First time using Yearn. I thought I would get y1inch in return. Are the V2 vaults different in that they do not give you collateral to burn and redeem your deposited tokens, or am i missing something entirely.


[03/20/2021 5:52 PM] TorJado#3802
to clarify, do you see the value under deposited on yearn.finance?


[03/20/2021 7:20 PM] rosh.eth#0001
Hi @ONI was the issue with withdraws from v1 eth vaults resolved? I tried last week to migrate and it was $600 to migrate which was crazy high and tried to withdraw but came with the same issue as the other fellow where it didn’t do anything. The vault was still there?


[03/20/2021 8:50 PM] TranslucentMonkey#9147
if this is to my query: Yes, I see the value is deposited. Do I need to add a custom token to my metamask to see it in there?


[03/20/2021 11:15 PM] TorJado#3802
yup! you should be able to see it quickly if you look up your wallet on ethscan and see it be deposited


[03/20/2021 11:15 PM] TorJado#3802
let me know if you're still around and nneed a hand


[03/21/2021 2:14 AM] ONI#6888
yes its resolved


[03/21/2021 3:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Is the deposit button not working for anyone else?


[03/21/2021 4:40 AM] ONI#6888
Havent heard of this problem, maybe try cntl+shift+r

[03/21/2021 4:50 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
hey im just trying to test out how this works


[03/21/2021 4:50 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
i have $5 in ETH


[03/21/2021 4:50 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
and connected metamask to yearn


[03/21/2021 4:51 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
is that too little to deposit into a vault


[03/21/2021 4:51 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
seeing my available balance is 0.00


[03/21/2021 4:51 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
even though my wallet is connected


[03/21/2021 4:51 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
is there some sort of minimum?


[03/21/2021 4:55 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
hmm or maybe it is registering


[03/21/2021 4:55 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
and i just have so little ETH, ~0.003 that its rounding it to 0.00


[03/21/2021 4:55 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
obvi sums are tiny


[03/21/2021 4:56 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
but just wanted to start with trivial amounts, to test whole thing


[03/21/2021 5:18 AM] ONI#6888
so the problem is it wont let you deposit into the vault on yearn.finance?


[03/21/2021 5:18 AM] ONI#6888
is this with the zap?


[03/21/2021 5:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
That is with zap


[03/21/2021 5:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
I hit “deposit” and nothing


[03/21/2021 5:19 AM] ONI#6888
yah generally you need more than 5$


[03/21/2021 5:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Two browsers and a restart 🤷🏼‍♂️


[03/21/2021 5:19 AM] ONI#6888
as gas alone to deposit will be 50$ or 25$


[03/21/2021 5:19 AM] ONI#6888
try to zap from zapper.fi


[03/21/2021 5:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Will do next time


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
nice thanks


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
yeah if i go here


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
https://v1.yearn.finance/vaults


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] ONI#6888
use yearn.finance


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
i can at least see my 0.003 eth


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] ONI#6888
generally best not to use v1 if you dont have to


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] ONI#6888
ah ok


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
but gas fees make it make no sense


[03/21/2021 5:21 AM] ONI#6888
yah it might be too little to show up but if you hit deposit max it will work


[03/21/2021 5:22 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
yeah i did hit max on yearn.finance and it didnt show up


[03/21/2021 5:22 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
whats the difference between those two sites?


[03/21/2021 5:22 AM] ONI#6888
I mean did it say 0?


[03/21/2021 5:22 AM] ONI#6888
I mean if you hit max and deposit it will deposit what you have


[03/21/2021 5:23 AM] ONI#6888
the main site is yearn.finance the old site is v1 but it is not actively maintained


[03/21/2021 5:23 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
got it


[03/21/2021 5:24 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
and yeah on the yearn.finance interface it shows 0.00. but actually if i hid deposit, it opens my metamask and there is shows 0.003


[03/21/2021 5:24 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
so its there, youre right


[03/21/2021 5:24 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
again, gas fees make it jokes/stupid


[03/21/2021 5:25 AM] ONI#6888
yah well normally it doesnt pay to yield farm with less than like 4k usd


[03/21/2021 5:25 AM] ONI#6888
or atleast 1k usd because of gas fees


[03/21/2021 5:25 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
whats the min that it makes sense to play around with if im just like new to this stuff, still kinda skeptical. but curious


[03/21/2021 5:25 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
nice nice okay


[03/21/2021 5:25 AM] allcards_faceup#7791
gas on 1k is basically same as gas would be on $5?


[03/21/2021 5:30 AM] j.#6352
yes gas is the same regardless of amount


[03/21/2021 8:50 AM] 000x4#6598
I dont quite understand what yearn.fi is,
Is it to show additional information for vaults?


[03/21/2021 1:08 PM] DB Cooper#4985
Is anybody else having trouble withdrawing from the Mushroom Worker Experimental Vault?  I tried this morning and it had a warning before processing the transaction: "ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code."  Once this transaction did fail this error came up on etherscan: "Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [Reverted] "  Please help.  I don't need to withdrawal immediately, but I would like to know that I will be able to at some point.  Thank you! @banteg


[03/21/2021 2:44 PM] justreem#7975
I'm trying to borrow from the Iron Bank (on https://yearn.fi/lend). I have supplied  $1700 of y3Crv which has an IB collateral factor of 90%. When I attempt to turn on "collateral" the loading animation continuously spins and an "invalid address" error is displayed in my developer console.

any thoughts?

Yup


[03/23/2021 5:40 AM] ONI#6888
whenever harvest is called


[03/23/2021 5:40 AM] ONI#6888
harvest is called at the opportune time which for each vault is different, could be every few hours or once a week.


[03/23/2021 5:40 AM] Deleted User#0000

Would be best strategy to pull deposits right after harvest?


[03/23/2021 5:41 AM] ONI#6888
maybe for v1, but for v2 harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent just this kind of thing


[03/23/2021 5:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
I see


[03/23/2021 5:42 AM] ONI#6888
but generally not sure it matters that much when you withdrawal, most harvests only accure a small amount more value than it had before

On yearn.fi/lend I used my y3Crv (from the 3Crv vault) and supplied it to the Iron Bank as collateral and got back cyY3CRV, however  under yearn.fi/invest, I no longer see an investment balance associated with y3Crv 

Am I still earning a return on the 3Crv vault? If so, is there anywhere I can see those returns? They are not appearing within the yearn UI.


[03/23/2021 9:54 AM] Deepcryptodive | GoodGhosting#1337
Yes, you still own the underlying y3Crv tokens (which can be seen here https://v1.yearn.finance/lending)


[03/23/2021 9:54 AM] Deepcryptodive | GoodGhosting#1337
Not sure what the best way would be to track that price though.


[03/23/2021 9:55 AM] Deepcryptodive | GoodGhosting#1337
Since these tokens are locked in the Iron Bank, they do not show on the main yearn vaults page


[03/23/2021 10:13 AM] justreem#7975
great, thanks for the clarification!

Hi, so I have a bunch of cyY3CRV that represents about 5x leverage from my original deposit. I see that it can be zapped into another vault, and I'm curious what this transaction would do. Would I get that full levered position in the new vault, would it mess with my debt to collateral percentage, would it just unwind it all and deposit the original amount?

[03/23/2021 7:15 PM] vany#0365
if you are in the pool then you are surrendering you 3crv rewards, if you want 3crv rewards you cant deposit into the pool


[03/23/2021 7:16 PM] ABEF#9246
Alright, so if I buy directly some yvecrv and hold them, I will get those crv reward ?


[03/23/2021 7:17 PM] vany#0365
correct, if you just hold yvecrv if your wallet you will be eligible for 3crv rewards


[03/23/2021 7:18 PM] vany#0365
also always check the pool price before just depositing, like today there is a pretty big discount on yvecrv vs crv, that will allow you to earn even more 3crv

[03/23/2021 7:22 PM] ABEF#9246
When I read the vault description, it may looks like the LP rewards are more worthy than the 3crv rewards

currently they are, so it would be a trade off

One thing to point out: 3crv is something *completelty* different than CRV. 3CRV=stablecoins (dai, usdc, usdt). CRV is the Curve governance token.
the yvecrv vault will only earn you 3crv(=stablecoins) but *not* CRV.

[03/24/2021 10:07 AM] vany#0365
Well if you deposit crv on curves website it also pays out in 3crv. So both options pay your in 3crv but if you hold yvecrv you get more 3crv


[03/24/2021 10:09 AM] Johnny F#4404
I totally know. But ABEF's request, to me, seems like he wants to earn CRV.

Question 23:
What does the crv prefix mean for the vault names?
Answer:
It means that the vault farms on the Curve pool with the associated token or pool name. The basic Curve strategy of locking 10% of CRV earned for boosts, selling the rest, then buying for more of the underlying Curve LP token, all in addition to the Curve pool's trading fees, applies to vaults with the crv prefix. crvBUSD farms on the Curve BUSD pool, crvSETH farms on the Curve SETH pool, crvGUSD farms on the Curve GUSD pool, and so on.

crvGUSD is the pool on curve which has 4 coins in it: GUSD, USDT, DAI, USDC. You can deposit any combination of those on curve to get crvgusd LP tokens to deposit in yearn. But as said, with Zap it should not be needed to do this manually any more

[03/25/2021 4:30 PM] Bidoche#1266
Hello I have Yearn assets on a Crypto wallet since the beginning of March. When I try to withdraw them, the ETH fees are so high (around 30 to 40% of amount) that there is no point in withdrawing the amount... is it standard fees and processes with Yearn assets ? thank you in advance for your help


[03/25/2021 4:33 PM] Johnny F#4404
ETH fees have nothing to do with yearn or the amount you put into yearn. They are fees for processing on the ethereum network. You can try to lowball the fees, then it will probably take a few hours before it processes (for example go for 101 gwei - your wallet will allow you to set that somewhere). But thats still gonna cost around $30-80 or so


[03/25/2021 4:34 PM] Bidoche#1266

ask for and vote for a buyback and burn of yvecrv with the eps airdrop. that way value accrues to all yvecrv holders

Hi some noob questions if it's okay.
When I use the ape tax vaults for ALCX, the price per share should go up with time to reflect the compounding/staking gains correct?


[03/26/2021 12:48 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
yes.  but just so you are aware those are experimental vaults with small deposit limits


[03/26/2021 12:49 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
they are designed for testing.  if you want to participate totally fine, but they are at higher risk given that is testing the code before its widely deployed


[03/26/2021 12:50 PM] rektmofo#4849
thanks for replying.
yeah I am aware, just checking things out..
I see there's a 10% performance fee
so if the APR on alchemix app is 1% a day, I get 0.9% on ape tax
and it compounds if I got this correct.


[03/26/2021 12:51 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
yes.  although the harvest may be less often


[03/26/2021 12:51 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
than each day


[03/26/2021 12:51 PM] rektmofo#4849
oh


[03/26/2021 12:51 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
depends on the strategy to optimize for gas


[03/26/2021 12:52 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
may be more, may be less each vault depends on the circumstances.  But if earning 1% per day it just may mean you earn 2% in 2 days


[03/26/2021 12:52 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
and compounding is not exactly daily

But the performance fee is paid on the absolute value of harvest right
not the difference between if I harvest directly on app versus using compounding on vault

Is there a way to track returns on crvSETH vault?  I dont see it on feel the yearn

https://app.zerion.io/invest/asset/yveCRV-0x0e880118c29f095143dda28e64d95333a9e75a47


[03/26/2021 1:05 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
yes it on value of harvest (more accurately it might be the increase in price per share).


[03/26/2021 1:15 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
thank you.  Zerion seems to think i have the v1 version while on yearn vault it clearly states i have the v2 version.  Does that matter?


[03/26/2021 1:16 PM] j.#6352
It says "sETH Curve yVault 2.0" on top, but yes it doesnt matter as long as the token is read right


[03/26/2021 1:17 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
to be clear,  zerion states i have equity in https://app.zerion.io/invest/asset/yveCRV-0x986b4aff588a109c09b50a03f42e4110e29d353f

oh the one i linked must be different then 🤷‍♂️


[03/26/2021 1:20 PM] j.#6352

[03/26/2021 6:52 PM] J.#4521
if you deposit the yCRV token into the vault. What token do you get back for that LP? yyCRV? yUSD?


[03/26/2021 6:52 PM] vany#0365
yyCRV and yUSD are the same thing


[03/26/2021 6:53 PM] J.#4521
and I can colleteralize those on cream?


[03/26/2021 6:53 PM] vany#0365
Yes


[03/26/2021 6:55 PM] J.#4521
is there a way to take the yUSD back to curve and put it into something ?


[03/26/2021 6:55 PM] J.#4521

[03/26/2021 6:55 PM] J.#4521

[03/26/2021 6:56 PM] vany#0365
Back to curve? No


[03/26/2021 6:57 PM] vany#0365
You can deposit to cream or use it as an LP on sushi if you are looking to extract more value. Sushi has incentives on a yUSD-eth SLP


[03/26/2021 7:09 PM] J.#4521
gotcha... i guess that would be the end of the train. so if i were to take this direction, the yield coming from my yCRV token would be the minimum and im unable to boost it becasue ill be depositing it into Yearn.? correct?


[03/26/2021 7:15 PM] dds#4716
Hello i need some help, 
i have DAI in the V1 vault and i would like to acces it but when i use my Metamask app with my android phone (the way i always use) the YFI website does not recognize me and tell me to download Metamask to acces to the website instead of i'm already using it so i refresh the page but it's still the same message who appear... if someone can help me it would be really nice...


[03/26/2021 7:46 PM] vany#0365
You can see the current boost on yearn.finance


[03/26/2021 7:47 PM] vany#0365
Did you try hard restarting the app and disconnecting your wallet on the site and then reconnect?


[03/26/2021 9:14 PM] anh#8888
do i get a erc-20 tokens when i deposited my dai to yearn vault?


[03/26/2021 10:21 PM] vany#0365
yes you will get vault tokens

iron bank curve vault or IronBank as in cream v2?


[03/26/2021 11:47 PM] getrichslow.eth#7140
cream v2 sorry

im not aware of any restriction on withdraws


[03/26/2021 11:49 PM] vany#0365
but the functions of IronBank are mostly run by cream, yearn uses iron bank, so you may need to ask in their discord


[03/26/2021 11:52 PM] getrichslow.eth#7140
it wasn't working for me earlier and I saw a few others complain about it


[03/26/2021 11:52 PM] getrichslow.eth#7140
maybe it wasn't displaying my balance right?


[03/26/2021 11:53 PM] getrichslow.eth#7140
because they were migrating it or something to https://yearn.fi/lend ?


[03/27/2021 12:35 AM] vany#0365
ah if you are trying to use yearn.fi thats a beta/alternative website run by andre and @Anton , maybe he has an update on the status of any issues

[03/27/2021 5:40 AM] J.#4521
i deposited usdc into the usdc vault.  got a yvUSDC token. thought i would get a yUSD. Which pool gives me the yUSD token to use as colleteral on cream?


[03/27/2021 5:41 AM] j.#6352
yUSD is the vault token for curve's y pool


[03/27/2021 5:41 AM] j.#6352
it's called yCRV on the yearn.finance website


[03/27/2021 5:42 AM] j.#6352
it might be cheaper to just buy it on uniswap, sushiswap, or 1inch


[03/27/2021 5:42 AM] J.#4521
so i would have to go through curve for that ?


[03/27/2021 5:42 AM] J.#4521

[03/27/2021 5:55 AM] j.#6352
yUSD has millions on sushi and uni


[03/27/2021 5:55 AM] j.#6352
probably the most liquid y vault token on any dex


[03/27/2021 6:18 AM] J.#4521
or yUSD yes... but I want the yCRV to stake and get yUSD to utilize


[03/27/2021 6:41 AM] Anton#9785
@getrichslow.eth I just Deposited, Withdrew, Borrowed and Repaid DUSD on v1.yearn.finance. So the functionality works, it's something with your account/how you are doing it.

I'm assuming you are exceeding your borrow limit, or there isn't any liquidity. I'm not aware of any other reasons why the TX will fail. Alternatively send the TX to cream guys to have a look. I didn't build the smart contracts, so I'm not 100% sure how they work.
DM me if you want me to investigate further.


[03/27/2021 6:42 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
Thank you I tried a bunch of different things like basic troubleshooting and I'm stumped


[03/27/2021 9:43 AM] ONI#6888
Im pretty sure if someone is borrowing your capital in ironbank you cannot withdrawal it but I would check with the cream team

[03/27/2021 5:59 PM] vany#0365
yes, your position is based on the y3crv coins you hold, if you send them to a different wallet then everything is then in the new wallet

thank you

if i deposit into a crvSETH pool by zapping in with ETH, when i withdraw, what would i get?


[03/27/2021 10:24 PM] j.#6352
zapper, zerion, debank, and #🔗links


[03/27/2021 10:25 PM] j.#6352
if you withdraw from yearn.finance, you will get crvSETH. If you withdraw by zapping out on zapper or zerion, you can get any token you choose


[03/27/2021 10:26 PM] angelfish#8253
is crvSETH what you get when you deposit into the SETH pool on curve?


[03/27/2021 10:27 PM] j.#6352
yes it's the LP token for the sETH pool on Curve


[03/27/2021 10:27 PM] angelfish#8253
so could i somehow withdraw from curve?


[03/27/2021 10:27 PM] angelfish#8253
to get eth back

if you want to do the extra steps and spend more gas, you can just withdraw to ETH from Curve right after withdrawing from Yearn

[03/27/2021 10:29 PM] j.#6352
you might also have to do an approval transaction first, if you havent already for Curve

I deposited into the 3crv vault and received back y3crv tokens.  However when i deposited into crvSETH vault i received back yveCRV tokens.  Why am i not receiving ycrvSETH tokens? isnt yveCRV something different that the SETH position on crv?


[03/27/2021 11:10 PM] j.#6352
yes it's confusing but the yveCRV you got is [Y] [V]ault [E]CRV


[03/27/2021 11:10 PM] j.#6352
E for ETH


[03/27/2021 11:11 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
ok i think i have it figured out now


[03/27/2021 11:11 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
CRV VAULT: This vault converts your CRV into yveCRV


[03/27/2021 11:11 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
but the token is actually yveCRV - DAO


[03/27/2021 11:12 PM] Lee and Hester#5963

[03/28/2021 1:06 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
sorry first time


[03/28/2021 1:08 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
I think I want the Pool menu


[03/28/2021 1:08 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
3 pool CRV?


[03/28/2021 1:13 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
so If I understand this correctly you have to pay gas at least twice to get USD into CRV in order to vault it ?


[03/28/2021 1:17 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
no matter what I do the metamask confirm button is never active to approve a transfer


[03/28/2021 1:18 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
I think you ALSO need ETH to even enable it to do anything? I'm so confused.


[03/28/2021 1:20 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
it seems to take ETH to even convert USDC into ETH, so I'm screwed I guess.


[03/28/2021 2:19 AM] j.#6352
do you have ETH?


[03/28/2021 2:19 AM] j.#6352
you need ETH to pay for transactions on Ethereum


[03/28/2021 5:06 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
I finally did get some, but I put the price too low apparently so it's stuck in limbo


[03/28/2021 5:07 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
is yearn just rotating between various crypto lending programs?


[03/28/2021 5:07 AM] j.#6352
you can speed up the transaction in metamask


[03/28/2021 5:08 AM] j.#6352
For Yearn's Earn product specifically, yes


[03/28/2021 5:09 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
I discovered nexo, blockfi and some others so the picture is starting to mke sense


[03/28/2021 5:09 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
10-12% is possible there depending on supple and demand.


[03/28/2021 5:10 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
ETH gas cost appears to be 9-12$ typical for a transaction to go through so small amounts are not good. BTC is similar in cost right now.


[03/28/2021 5:11 AM] j.#6352
for basic ETH transfers, yes. that's the cheapest transaction you can do


[03/28/2021 5:11 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
that was a big surprise to me, but it's mostly more recently the costs have shot up I guess due to network issues and surge in demand for crypto


[03/28/2021 5:11 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
hopefully the original txn will be cancelled eventually, cause it was at like 50 and no one wil process that


[03/28/2021 5:11 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
I dont know if there is a timeout


[03/28/2021 5:13 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
so at least I now have a basic understanding of how the Earn function works.


[03/28/2021 5:14 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
now I am trying to understand the vault numbers


[03/28/2021 5:14 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
it cannot be expressed as a simple interest rate|?


[03/28/2021 5:17 AM] j.#6352
no because yield is always different


[03/28/2021 5:17 AM] j.#6352
so at average, the numbers pulled are interpolated weekly


[03/28/2021 5:17 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
so for example crvUSDP is growing rapidly , whatever strategy it is


[03/28/2021 5:20 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
I should always move for example USDC or any currency in my wallet out of the exchange into my own wallet, then from my wallet into yearn vaults, correct?


[03/28/2021 5:21 AM] j.#6352
yes


[03/28/2021 5:21 AM] j.#6352
you cant interact with yearn from an exchange


[03/28/2021 5:21 AM] j.#6352
for extra security, i recommend you interface a hardware wallet with metamask


[03/28/2021 5:23 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
now that I understand the fees better (it was a surprise), coinbase assesses their own when you buy the USDC (and I think it doesn't matter too much which coin as it gets deposited to the vault with whatever value it currently has?), then there is a gas fee to move it to a wallet (it was about 4$), then there is a higher gas fee (9-12$) to move it into yearn.


[03/28/2021 5:24 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
if I want to cash out I need to do the reverse process.


[03/28/2021 5:24 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
the vault balance is auto-compounded I believe.


[03/28/2021 5:24 AM] j.#6352
this is what yearn is for


[03/28/2021 5:25 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
it appears it just crossed 1.5B in assets


[03/28/2021 5:26 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
the growth appears also much higher than any of the lending programs I have seen


[03/28/2021 5:26 AM] j.#6352
:yea:


[03/28/2021 5:27 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
and the strategy exeucted is too technical for most people


[03/28/2021 5:37 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
was reading more and these are all open source strategies and people vote to include and allocate to them


[03/28/2021 5:39 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
the gas limit should be 21000 for a simple transfer right?


[03/28/2021 5:39 AM] j.#6352
for an ETH transfer yes


[03/28/2021 5:42 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
55000 Gas Used (Units) / 49811 Gas Price (GWEI) 85
 Total $7.26


[03/28/2021 5:42 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
so it doesn't actually need to be this high


[03/28/2021 5:43 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
what would happen to other transactions using the same USDC, they should get rejected right?


[03/28/2021 5:43 AM] j.#6352
with 21000? yes because that involves a contract, telling it to transfer USDC from one address to another


[03/28/2021 5:44 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
oh so a USDC transfer IS more expensive, the 21000 that I'm reading is only for ETH directly


[03/28/2021 5:44 AM] j.#6352
yes ive said this multiple times man


[03/28/2021 5:54 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
is there any reason a confirmed txn would not result in a vault balance? https://etherscan.io/tx/0x51f868def435e53f2252a375fe4a4093877bc7850739c4f09a5295020759fd5f


[03/28/2021 5:54 AM] j.#6352
you only did the approval transaction


[03/28/2021 5:54 AM] j.#6352
you'll have to do a second one for the actual deposit


[03/28/2021 5:55 AM] j.#6352
any new contract you interact with will need approval


[03/28/2021 5:55 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665
ok so the same actions again and paying another txn fee?


[03/28/2021 5:55 AM] j.#6352
yes

yeah I think I got how to do it now - but my mistakes from earlier are stuck there

no


[03/28/2021 6:18 AM] binaryalgorithm#2665

for deposits or zaps you need to approve the contract to spend your token

then you do the zap or deposit so yes 2 trxs

Is it normal that i have been in the stETH vault for 8 days now, but am still -1% in the red? If yes, then why is that?

[03/28/2021 2:01 PM] chapati#5398
crv.ape.tax question: Does it matter whether i
a) buy CRV and deposit it into the vault or
b) just buy veCRV-DAO tokens from the sushi vault at https://app.sushi.com/token/0XC5BDDF9843308380375A611C18B50FB9341F502A
?


[03/28/2021 2:01 PM] chapati#5398
(cuz buying veCRV looks like much cheaper for achieving the same result as buying CRV for a higher price and then locking it into the vault)


[03/28/2021 2:03 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
It doesn't matter, if you have the yveCRV in your wallet you get 3crv


[03/28/2021 2:04 PM] chapati#5398
gotcha, thanks!


[03/28/2021 6:15 PM] ecohash#4194
howdy -- I just pushed some ETH into the yveCRV-ETH vault; wanting to get some confirmation that I did that right as I am pretty new to DeFi


[03/28/2021 9:11 PM] NatyShi#6948
hi, trying to deposit on crv yvecrv vault. token apporved but when pushing on DEPOSIT, the site never calls to my wallet to confirm txs. web is always too slow but I don´t think that this is not working due to that as token approval was quick


[03/28/2021 9:11 PM] NatyShi#6948
is deposit on this vault disabled? I was waiting for low gas fee moment to lock my crv and I am not able to do it


[03/28/2021 9:16 PM] NatyShi#6948
@everyone please check comment above for support


[03/28/2021 9:51 PM] vany#0365
The zap deposits into pickle.finance. Use the pickle link on the website and you should see your holdings


[03/28/2021 9:51 PM] vany#0365
There is a discount right now on yvecrv. Go to sushi and trade for it to get better rates


[03/28/2021 10:03 PM] NatyShi#6948
how can I check-know that swaping crv for yvecrv-dao is better in sushiswap? I am not familiar to this...having yvecrv-dao token am I going to receive fees later from curve?


[03/28/2021 10:08 PM] vany#0365
You can just check the trade on sushi swap and it will tell you the estimate. And yes either way will give you the same benefit

💯 

[03/28/2021 10:10 PM] NatyShi#6948
thanks, I did it, not sure the difference on price you said but I trusted you haha. thanks!


[03/28/2021 11:10 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
what does that mean there is a discount?


[03/28/2021 11:22 PM] vany#0365
When you deposit into yvecrv it’s automatically 1:1. Currently on sushi it’s trading for less than 1:1, more like 1:1.3 right now, so you can get more yvecrv for your crv by trading vs depositing. Sometimes it’s the other way around so it’s just something to keep an eye on.


[03/28/2021 11:22 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
thank you


[03/28/2021 11:22 PM] ecohash#4194
@vany is there a way to get my metamask to see my holdings from that transaction that sit on pickle.finance?


[03/28/2021 11:26 PM] vany#0365
You would have to get the coin info and manually add it or you can use zapper.fi, they should automatically show your balance if you connect your wallet


[03/28/2021 11:30 PM] ecohash#4194
@vany zapper.fi sees it, and the balance shows on app.pickle.finance and yearn.finance/vaults as well, just not in my metamask wallet.


[03/28/2021 11:31 PM] ecohash#4194
it is like it is looking at the wrong smart contract or something?


[03/28/2021 11:34 PM] vany#0365
No it’s just metamask doesn’t support most tokens. You can manually add it but you will have to look up how to do that. I personally don’t add them unless I need too as I only interact with those tokens with the apps


[03/28/2021 11:35 PM] ecohash#4194
right on


[03/28/2021 11:35 PM] ecohash#4194
thanks for the help


[03/28/2021 11:35 PM] vany#0365
The coins are there. Metamask just doesn’t look for them so it doesn’t show, you have to manually tell metamask the coin and then you can see it


[03/28/2021 11:36 PM] ecohash#4194
I am a little over my skiis with all of this if you can't tell. Eager to learn and figured I just needed to jump in and stumble around for a bit.


[03/28/2021 11:37 PM] vany#0365
It’s a little complicated but easy once you know where to look. There should be YouTube videos that can teach you. Not easy over messages


[03/28/2021 11:38 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
yveCRV - Eth on Yearn states 60.09% growth but on pickle it only states 38.59%.  Is the 38.59 on pickle (from Sushi and Lp) on top of the 60% from yearn or how do those returns work out?


[03/28/2021 11:38 PM] vany#0365
Are you looking at the farm or the jar?


[03/28/2021 11:39 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
jar


[03/28/2021 11:39 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
ignoring farm for now


[03/28/2021 11:39 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
farm only adds 4%


[03/28/2021 11:40 PM] ecohash#4194
@Unknown I had that same question


[03/28/2021 11:40 PM] ecohash#4194
looks like ~60% on yearn, app.pickle.farm shows ~40 something


[03/28/2021 11:44 PM] vany#0365
Might be an old number that has not updated. I’ll ask the devs


[03/28/2021 11:44 PM] vany#0365
40% appears correct when looking directly at sushi numbers


[03/28/2021 11:46 PM] vany#0365
With pickle rewards being low, might be an option to withdraw from pickle and stake with sushi, it’s more like 100% apy but 2/3rds of the rewards are locked for 6 months


[03/28/2021 11:47 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
I was considering that.


[03/28/2021 11:47 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
So does that mean the listed yearn growth numbers are not dynamic?  numbers on pickle seem to be adjusting on their own


[03/28/2021 11:47 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
same with harvest.fi


[03/28/2021 11:48 PM] vany#0365
That specific vault is custom vs all the other vaults so I’m not sure. Devs are offline so waiting for answer


[03/28/2021 11:52 PM] ecohash#4194
does the vault automatically do this for users? This type of automated decision making was what got me pretty excited about yearn


[03/29/2021 12:19 AM] vany#0365
Yes pickle automates it for you but with the way sushi locks some of the vault tokens for 6 months pickle can only automate the unlocked sushi and reinvest for you

Hi there, i use yearn.finance from a while but noticed this yearn.fi official website. What’s the difference between the two and which one do you advise to use? Thanks 🙏


[03/29/2021 4:51 AM] vany#0365 (pinned)
Both should work. Yearn.finance is maintained by yearn core team. Yearn.fi is more of a beta testing website run by Andre and Anton

[03/29/2021 3:19 PM] ImYourHodlberry#9281
I don't get the crvIB vault.  It appears I can deposit just about any coin into that vault directly and get the stated interest.  Is that true?  Where do my tokens go?  To Cream?


[03/29/2021 3:27 PM] j.#6352
You can now zap into Yearn vaults. That means you can come from (almost) any token and the zap will do all the necessary transactions for you in one, instead of you having to do each individual step: deposit stablecoin in Curve, then deposit Curve pool LP tokens in Yearn


[03/29/2021 5:35 PM] ImYourHodlberry#9281
Yeah, but what about tokens that are not accepted on Curve?  It seems, for instance, I can deposit my FTT, BAT or AAVE tokens into the crvIB vault and get the interest.  Is that true?


[03/29/2021 5:47 PM] Johnny F#4404
If you use zap/yearn to "deposit" non-USDT/USDC/DAI into crvIB, your tokens will be swapped to these stablecoins. And those will be deposited instead. So you dont keep your exposure to your non-stablecoin-tokens that way.


[03/29/2021 6:36 PM] ImYourHodlberry#9281
So it's like trading those tokens for stablecoins.  Nah, that's not what I want to do.  Thanks for clarifying that.


[03/29/2021 6:47 PM] binaryalgorithm#2665
so is it more efficient to just begin with a stablecoin when zapping into a crv vault?


[03/29/2021 8:07 PM] TorJado#3802
it depends on which vault you're entering


[03/29/2021 8:07 PM] TorJado#3802
zapping doesn't magically disappear gas costs


[03/29/2021 8:07 PM] TorJado#3802
so try to mentally map how many swaps you would need to have the coins needed for the vault


[03/29/2021 8:49 PM] DB Cooper#4985
Any luck with the strategist?  I checked again today and the same error comes up - "ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code."  Thanks for looking into it.


[03/29/2021 11:15 PM] Lee and Hester#5963
Are yearn fees taken on withdrawal or is it already factored into listed growth %?


[03/29/2021 11:16 PM] arberx#3367

[03/30/2021 1:18 AM] Lee and Hester#5963
thank you.  is there a particular place here to find harvesting information? I am curious about the crv seth vault and the 3crv vault


[03/30/2021 1:19 AM] j.#6352
not exactly harvest, but you can look at pricepershare


[03/30/2021 1:19 AM] j.#6352
increase in pricepershare usually coincides with harvest

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[03/30/2021 2:33 AM] Lee and Hester#5963
Yes I’ve seen this.  according to the price per share jumps crv Seth has harvested multiple times since I deposited .  I am just trying to understand.  Some sites do better job of visualizing things.

Thanks J.  Regarding the YFI vault deposit problem I'm having.  I had definitely selected YFI and 0.42. for the amount  I noticed that the 0.42 was rounded up so also tried 0.41.  I've also noticing that it's flashing up a couple of times with that same Windows Security window as before, asking to touch the Ledger but without giving me the chance to (this is even though I'm using Metamask and linking to the Ledger via that).  So I'm guessing it's some sort of Ledger integration issue.  Nevermind, thanks for your help.


[03/31/2021 11:42 AM] j.#6352
I dont have a ledger so im not sure but maybe it has something to do with enabling contract data if you havent already https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009576554-Ethereum-ETH-

I don't see a zap option for the vaults. The twitter announcing 1 click zapping said a drop down from the deposit tab would allow zapping. The crvIB only says approve. The other vaults have deposit, but no drop down for zapping. Anyone else see this?

🚑  HELP HELP HELP 🚑 

I'm trying to withdraw from YTUSD pool and being asked a very high Gas fee to pay for it. I believe it may be an issue with the specific vault as when I try to withdraw 0TUSD, the Gas fee is "normal", whilst once I put an actual number other than zero, it goes to over 1000 usd worth ETH and sometimes even north of 2000 usd worth. 

When I try to withdraw from crvGUSD or crvMUSD, things seem to be fine. Can someone / a #developer or so please look into this or guide me?

is https://yearn.finance/zap down? Nothing loads on the page. I've tried a couple different devices and networks.


[04/02/2021 10:05 AM] GMONEY#1501
https://v1.yearn.finance/zap loads but I am assuming the other link is the correct one.


[04/02/2021 10:08 AM] j.#6352
Zapping is integrated on the main yearn.finance page. No nee to navigate away. Also, buying it from a dex would be the fastest and cheapest way to get yUSD

Hi - I need some help - I have ETH / WETH in a V1 vault - I've been trying to migrate and withdraw for a week and whenever I try anything, the transaction just gets stuck. It gives me a minute tracker and it gets stuck there - left it open for days and nothing. Even paid the fastest gas.

How does the borrowing system work?


[04/02/2021 6:55 PM] ethvalidator#4184
Hello! Noob question: I borrowed DAI on compound with WBTC on collateral and entered a couple of yearn vaults. I’m paying ~10% apy rate for that loan on compound. I just saw that I can put wbtc as collateral on oasis.borrow and their stability fee is 4.5%. Seems like a much better option. 1) Is there anything I’m missing? 2) can I do something similar with yborrow? 3) is there a better strategy I haven’t found yet to collateralize Eth it wbtc and earn  passive income? Thanks!

hi, I am a bit new to vaults - and this may be a silly question,
but I see crvUSDN vault, however I have USDT, how do I convert it into crvUSDN?


[04/03/2021 3:39 AM] j.#6352
On the Yearn website, you can zap into vaults with any token you have in your wallet. Just click on the crvUSDN vault, click on the drop down menu in the deposit to select your USDT


[04/03/2021 3:40 AM] j.#6352
A few people have had issues though. So if that doesnt work, try it on Zapper.fi


[04/03/2021 5:24 AM] neoaway#0548
Ok thanks j.
Btw, what exactly is crvUSDN? Is it same as USDT? Will it always be equal to $1?


[04/03/2021 5:34 AM] j.#6352
it's the USDN pool on Curve

Hi, sorry if the answer is obvious but I can't find the info online. 
With Yve-curve, I traded Crv for yvecrv on sushiswap- am I still eligible to receive the rewards for just holding? Or is the mechanism that pays the "dividend" only doing so for depositing to the vault directly. 
Thanks in advance


[04/03/2021 7:13 AM] j.#6352
As long as you hold yveCRV in your wallet, you can claim weekly 3crv rewards. It doesn't matter where or how you get yveCRV tokens


[04/03/2021 7:57 AM] thomasku11#3486
where can we claim the 3crv?


[04/03/2021 7:58 AM] j.#6352
yearn website or crv.ape.tax


[04/03/2021 7:58 AM] thomasku11#3486
I heard there is an airdrop coming for those of us who have yeCRV. Is this true and if so is there somewhere we can read about this?

Hello, Would appreciate some help with this one. I joined the Back Scratcher pSLP yveCRV jar on pickle through yearn. I can see it on pickle under farms. I cannot see any evidence of it on yearn of curve. I understand that is because the tokens are staked on another protocol. What I am interested to know is that whether I'm earning rewards on the underlying assets in this farm? meaning, am I earning anything on the eth yearn vault I joined? or is it only the pickle farm rewards?


[04/03/2021 10:00 AM] j.#6352
Hover over the APY shown in Pickle to see the layers involved. You should be getting increasing SLP and also PICKLE


[04/03/2021 10:02 AM] elro3ob#3183
Ah. ok I did that and got this: pickle: 2.52% + sushi: 31.32% + lp: 4.11%. So this means I'm earning all these at concurrently? Or are they all used to farm pickle. Appreciate your help I'm a bit out of my depth here.


[04/03/2021 10:05 AM] j.#6352
SUSHI is being sold to get you more SLP. PICKLE is just for the farm itself. So you're earning PICKLE (2.52%) and more of your SLP (SLP 4.11% + SUSHI 31.32%)


[04/03/2021 10:06 AM] Johnny F#4404
1) You're not missing anything, that's exactly how it works and what you can do on oasis; usual caveat: gas fees are quite high to use oasis, so switching will cost you.
I cant help with 2+3 though


[04/03/2021 10:07 AM] elro3ob#3183
And SLPs are Sushi Liquidity tokens?


[04/03/2021 10:07 AM] j.#6352

[04/03/2021 2:12 PM] chichi#9745
Hello everyone! I wonder if someone could clarify if the boosts on Curve and boosts on Yearn are summing? I mean, let's say i've got CRV staked and it gives me 1.05 boost on the selected asset, and yearn is also giving the boost 1.25 on  the selected asset – does it all combines together?

Thank you!


[04/03/2021 2:12 PM] chichi#9745
In other words, I'm wondering if need to stake CRV at all if I'm about to use yearn vaults...


[04/03/2021 2:26 PM] j.#6352
nope


[04/03/2021 2:34 PM] chichi#9745
thank you!


[04/03/2021 2:35 PM] chichi#9745
so, just to be 100% sure, let me please give an example –


[04/03/2021 2:38 PM] chichi#9745
1) I  want to use crvIB pool. let's say I want to put there 1000 USDT. I also got 1600  CRV  staked for 4 years, giving  me a 1.22 boost.


[04/03/2021 2:39 PM] chichi#9745
2) After depositing I receive crvIB tokens and put them into yearn vault, which is now giving 1.25  boost.


[04/03/2021 2:39 PM] chichi#9745
In this case my boost is not counting?


[04/03/2021 2:39 PM] j.#6352
correct


[04/03/2021 2:40 PM] chichi#9745
and if my initial CRV boost was  bigger,  like 2.5 – than I don't even use yearn in  this case?


[04/03/2021 2:40 PM] j.#6352
the yearn vault will be holding your crvIB tokens so curve has nothing to boost for your wallet address


[04/03/2021 2:40 PM] j.#6352
yup


[04/03/2021 2:41 PM] j.#6352
but you'll have to manage it yourself

Hey, very new to yearn and yearn vaults. Yesterday I deposited some into the crvEURS vault. How can I see this appreciating? I checked the vault and I see the same amount of eursCRV as well as yveursCRV, no change


[04/03/2021 2:47 PM] j.#6352
your yvault tokens wont change. the underlying will. you can track eursCRV on zapper.fi and zerion.io


[04/03/2021 2:51 PM] yokoama#1205
Shouldnt the amount of eursCRV go up then?


[04/03/2021 2:51 PM] yokoama#1205
My understanding was there is harvest every day


[04/03/2021 2:52 PM] yokoama#1205

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[04/03/2021 2:52 PM] j.#6352

[04/04/2021 4:24 AM] yokoama#1205
just now I deposited into crvIB. Yesterday I deposited into crvEURS. Now I notice that today as I deposited into crvIB, the tokens in crvEURS have ben withdrawn


[04/04/2021 4:24 AM] yokoama#1205
I did not action that


[04/04/2021 4:29 AM] yokoama#1205
I guess must have been some old metamask transaction in there which got actioned


[04/04/2021 8:59 AM] chichi#9745
hello! I'm using the curve for the very first time to park my usdt. just want to make sure I'm doing it all correct. would be great if someone could approve I'm using it the right way. so, I decided to use Iron Bank pool. I'm going to deposit (and not "deposit and stake in gauge") my usdt into pool and recieve crvIB. Then, I'm going to yearn.finance and depositing my crvIB into vault. and that's it, right?

I don't have any CRV stake, so it's the most effecient strategy in my case?

and if I had some, I should have used "Deposit & stake in gauge" to receive the boost. is it correct way of thinking about it?

also there's an option to deposit Wrapped assets. and I wonder should I wrap my assets  before? what's the benefit of it? thank you!!!


[04/04/2021 9:00 AM] Johnny F#4404
are you sure the crvEURS were withdrawn? Can you see a transaction in your history (check maybe debank.com transaction history).
I sometimes get display errors in the UI that just doesnt show my tokens in some vaults (but still shows the others). Usually fixed after a page reload.


[04/04/2021 9:01 AM] yokoama#1205
it was withdrawn, had to deposit it again


[04/04/2021 9:01 AM] yokoama#1205
super weird


[04/04/2021 9:02 AM] yokoama#1205
I think maybe I had some old metamask TX in there which got triggered when I deposited IB


[04/04/2021 9:02 AM] Johnny F#4404
You're doing it correctly (first paragraph).

If you dont have CRV locked, yearn is a better choice than curve directly indeed. If you had, you'd stake it in the curve gauge, correct.

Deposit wrapped: if you already had deposited into iron bank (without curve), you could then get these already-deposited-coins (= wrapped coins) into curve. No need to do this here


[04/04/2021 9:03 AM] Johnny F#4404
ALright. Never heard of that before, and this is a problem that cannot be diagnosed without looking at the actual TX


[04/04/2021 9:17 AM] yokoama#1205
its my own fault


[04/04/2021 9:17 AM] yokoama#1205
It seems on April 3rd I clicked on withdraw just as a test, never actually went through with the TX


[04/04/2021 9:17 AM] yokoama#1205
but I think it stayed in metamask, so today when I deposited into IB


[04/04/2021 9:17 AM] yokoama#1205
it also went along with the supposed withdrawel TX from yesterday


[04/04/2021 9:23 AM] chichi#9745

Hi Everyone - how do I withdraw funds from the Pickle strategy?


[04/04/2021 12:08 PM] vany#0365
When that pops up it’s normally metamask telling you the tx will fail. Make sure you have the correct amount for withdraw


[04/04/2021 12:11 PM] vany#0365
Are you trying to withdraw everything?

[04/04/2021 12:15 PM] vany#0365
The gas limit can depend on what the vault has to do to get you your funds. If there are idle funds in the vault it will be cheaper vs if it need to pull the usdc out of strategies


[04/04/2021 12:17 PM] vany#0365
You would have to monitor the vault balance. If the idle funds are more than what you have to withdraw it would only pull from the vault


[04/04/2021 12:20 PM] vany#0365
In the vault contract


[04/04/2021 12:25 PM] vany#0365
No you just look at the usdc in the contract. Currently there is $1.1k idle


[04/04/2021 12:25 PM] peri#9000
is anyone seeing returns on their YFI v2 deposit? i deposited ~.3 YFI over a week ago and doesn't seem like there's been a harvest (or just too small an amount maybe)

Ill be back with some more liquidity from my mining 🙂


[04/05/2021 1:34 AM] allsilent#2545
Asked in #🏦vaults, but here is better probably: Aside from the risks of peg loss, smart contract concerns, and exploitative arbitrage (the DAI or harvest “hacks”), is there any reason to hang out in “vanilla” vaults like DAI v2 over, say, crvUSDN?
For instance, let’s say I believe that neutrino dollar is as peg-secure as DAI (debatable, but go with the hypothetical) and I’m not worried about a hack of the vault or smart contract woes. Is there any other reason to stay away from the crvXXXX vault? That asset’s value is also non-decreasing, yeah? Worst that can happen outside a peg loss is APY decreases to lower than I’m getting hanging out in DAI v2?


[04/05/2021 1:43 AM] j.#6352
If you want only 100% DAI exposure and cheaper gas involved. Otherwise, crvXXXX vaults have better yield


[04/05/2021 1:53 AM] allsilent#2545
Hm so gas is cheaper on the DAI vault? But the yield more than makes up for that, so not really a concern. Background: huge chunk of change of mine deposited into DAI v1, then the exploit happened, moved to v2 after we were all made whole and I’ve been there since. Now I’m debating a move again, since my only real objective is “make sure my pile of <insert any stable asset> doesn’t decrease in value, maximize yield as a bonus if able.” Do you get the impression that neutrino dollar is similarly at risk of peg loss compared to DAI (maybe not exactly, but close)? And is crvUSDN vault at more risk than DAI v2 in terms of arbitrage exploits like DAI v1 saw, or not really a worry?


[04/05/2021 1:55 AM] j.#6352
You might be overthinking this. If anything, recent exploits gave massive volume to Curve, giving LPs more fees, which mean more yield on Yearn vaults


[04/05/2021 1:55 AM] allsilent#2545
That’s a good point


[04/05/2021 1:55 AM] j.#6352
and tokens in Curve pools are not perfectly symmetrical

[04/05/2021 1:57 AM] allsilent#2545
Are you saying that helps the crvXXXX vaults or is a negative?


[04/05/2021 1:57 AM] j.#6352
click on any pool on Curve. you'll see the pool's liquidity at the bottom with percentages. theyre not always equal. so one token being more than the other doesnt necessarily mean youre fucked


[04/05/2021 1:57 AM] j.#6352
Im saying that it doesnt matter in the bigger picture


[04/05/2021 1:58 AM] j.#6352
You might even earn extra if you exit through a stablecoin in surplus


[04/05/2021 1:58 AM] j.#6352
or enter with a stablecoin in deficit


[04/05/2021 1:59 AM] allsilent#2545
Right, tracking that. Cool cool. So my concern about “what if DAI v1 hack happens again” is irrelevant to the crvStable vaults. I’m almost certainly overthinking things.


[04/05/2021 1:59 AM] j.#6352
Yup


[04/05/2021 1:59 AM] j.#6352
and whatever vulnerability was exposed was already patched and quickly too


[04/05/2021 2:00 AM] j.#6352
but that doesnt mean that everything is 100% safe. everything defi is still relatively new


[04/05/2021 2:01 AM] j.#6352
and Curve has had a good track record since it started


[04/05/2021 2:07 AM] allsilent#2545
Yeah it was a whirlwind. Happy ending though! So more plainly for my question: let’s say you have something big like 1 million DAI. It’s currently in DAI v2 on yearn. With the caveat of “I’ll continue to do my own research, I’m not gonna take whatever you say in advice and just do it, I won’t hold you liable etc etc (not that I even could),” would you leave that money there or migrate to a higher yield vault, specifically a crvStable vault? I’ve been in DeFi a while and yearn isn’t my only platform, but the money I’ve got there I want to be *nearly* as value-secure as leaving it in pure stable coin, with minimal risk of decrease. Preservation is more the name of my game with these funds.


[04/05/2021 2:08 AM] j.#6352
id go with the crv vaults


[04/05/2021 2:08 AM] j.#6352
with $1M, i wouldnt even think about gas


[04/05/2021 2:09 AM] j.#6352
at around 45% apy, that's about $1200 a day. easily pays off gas


[04/05/2021 2:14 AM] allsilent#2545
Thanks for chatting with me about this. Yeah without divulging my actual amount, I’m not worried about gas so much, I just want to make sure I’m truly understanding the different risk. Like if someone confirms for me that crvXXXX vaults work the same in terms of the DAI vault with regards to “your underlying token [DAI, crvUSDN, etc] will never decrease” (I’m 99.999% positive they do but I’ve gotta get that warm fuzzy feeling), then I’m basically set. With the final concern being I don’t want to wake up next month and have someone say “you idiot, you went with crvUSDN, didn’t you know that neutrino dollar was never going to hold its peg? You should’ve gone with crvblahblah”


[04/05/2021 2:15 AM] allsilent#2545
I’m right on my 99.9999% assessment there right?


[04/05/2021 2:16 AM] j.#6352
Yes that's the point of all Yearn vaults

[04/05/2021 2:18 AM] allsilent#2545
In your opinion, is USDN a strong play (I can move to #📈speculation if that’s better asked there)? It’s been really peg-strong for like a year.


[04/05/2021 3:17 AM] j.#6352
recently it's been crvUSDP and crvUSDN that have the highest apy


[04/05/2021 9:03 AM] Johnny F#4404
If you look at where the yield of the curve vault comes from, it's nearly exclusively from the CRV emissions, not any trading fees


[04/05/2021 12:33 PM] pintail#6790
Hey! The balanceOf function for the Yearn v2 WETH vault (maybe all vaults, I'm not sure) returns a whole load of extra zeroes, when the ERC-20 spec says it should return a single 256-bit integer. The issue came up when I was testing out TrueBlocks and it's been documented here: https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core/issues/1567 -- anyone know what's going on here?

There's a conversation in the Vyper channel here: https://discord.gg/8ecAfew3 where we think we found a bug in an older version of Vyper (which apparently this contract was compiled under). The values reported in the first 32-bytes are correct, but that version of Vyper returns 4096 bytes.


[04/05/2021 11:37 PM] pridegsu#3656
hey, I reported yesterday an error with the CRV vault. I talked with @ryan.miller but I'd like to understand how to follow up my issue. Basically I've deposited CRV into the backscratcher vault and, based on what I've understood, the vault was not routing correctly and it exchanged 1:1 the crv for yvecrv (when it's  30%~ less in value). You can see my tx below

This vault doesn't route at all. It mints 1:1.

[04/05/2021 11:44 PM] pridegsu#3656
I know, what I meant is that all the other vaults listed in the UI are working with zap except this one, which is very confusing. Why would you surface something in the UI that you know, for sure, that the user will loss 20% of their capital


[04/05/2021 11:46 PM] pridegsu#3656
I thought that the message was "outdated" because at the beginning the value was 1:1 ratio


[04/05/2021 11:51 PM] pridegsu#3656
I know how this works, I'm a software engineer working in another crypto project as well so I'd like to help, there are tons of things you can do to avoid this kind of user's error ending up in misleading flows


[04/05/2021 11:53 PM] vany#0365
if someone can write a zap that has the logic to pick the better option maybe it can get added but the description was exactly what the deposit did.


[04/05/2021 11:53 PM] vany#0365
you assumed it was outdated and didn't ask


[04/05/2021 11:55 PM] vany#0365
we are working on a new solution that should help with peg and not lose the 3crv rewards. that plus the upcoming vote about  eps rewards should help the whole situation


[04/05/2021 11:58 PM] pridegsu#3656
sry but I disagree, if you have surfaced something into the UI that can lead a user to loss their money (and in this specific case, this is the only purpose of this vault), the only one responsible of that is the team behind the app, not the user


[04/05/2021 11:59 PM] pridegsu#3656
why I'd need to ask in discord to use a web product, sry but if that was your are expecting that's a huge design error


[04/06/2021 12:04 AM] vany#0365
originally there was no way to trade


[04/06/2021 12:05 AM] vany#0365
you would just deposit and get yvecrv and then collect 3crv. no way to swap out


[04/06/2021 12:05 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
the liquidity to actually trade was created by yearn/sushi/pickle partnership offering incentives.


[04/06/2021 12:05 AM] vany#0365
the exit liquidity is not on peg but the deposit was not set up to consider a trading pair


[04/06/2021 12:05 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
within the past 1-2 months


[04/06/2021 12:06 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
prior to that only way to get yvecrv was to deposit 1:1


[04/06/2021 12:06 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
I get it.  It's not the answer you want to hear.


[04/06/2021 12:06 AM] pridegsu#3656
that's exactly what I was expecting, but then I got 20% less in value, which is a BIG gap. I know this was the only way when you went out with this vault to production but now you have a 30% price difference between CRV and yveCRV


[04/06/2021 12:07 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
if the market was pricing yvecrv > crv should sushi have a UI update to say hey don't swap here, use the yearn vault


[04/06/2021 12:07 AM] vany#0365
and if you want to trade for it you can, but the deposit is not set up for that and its says so in the description


[04/06/2021 12:08 AM] pridegsu#3656
I was thinking to use zapper but then I thought "why I'd you something else to interact with this vault instead of use the creator's apps" 😅


[04/06/2021 12:09 AM] vany#0365
as i said before we are working on a better solution to bring even better value so hopefully the peg will come back to 1:1 or even go over 1:1


[04/06/2021 12:09 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
+


[04/06/2021 12:09 AM] vany#0365
right now its sushi or 3crv, the new solution would not make you pick, you get both


[04/06/2021 12:11 AM] pridegsu#3656
reality is that the CRVs that I've transfer are already deposited in the contract and I got 20% less in value so I'd like to understand if there is a way to get the difference back (500usd)


[04/06/2021 12:11 AM] pridegsu#3656
I mean that money exists and it's there so I'm pretty sure it has to be a solution


[04/06/2021 12:13 AM] pridegsu#3656
based on the strategy your are using those CRV to boosts other strategies so fixing this will cost you zero


[04/06/2021 12:13 AM] pridegsu#3656
because you already have 500usd more that shouldn't be there


[04/06/2021 12:21 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
I do personally feel bad for your situation, but unfortunately there's really nothing yearn will do on this.  I'm just a volunteer here (so don't consider this authoritative), but that's the outcome.


[04/06/2021 12:22 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
everyone on here (including myself) have some story of something they did wrong (even unknowigly) that cost them significant $'s.


[04/06/2021 12:23 AM] pridegsu#3656
I'd like to understand if you are a yearn's team member and the right person to make this call or your are just assuming this is the way to go


[04/06/2021 12:23 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
im just giving you my opinion as a community member.


[04/06/2021 12:24 AM] pridegsu#3656
me too, believe me, but that's exactly why I was using yearn finance and not other shady crazy APY apps


[04/06/2021 12:25 AM] pridegsu#3656
so how can I talk with a yearn's team member or and make sure that I know if there are, or not, options


[04/06/2021 12:32 AM] vany#0365
that't not correct, yearn said it would give you 1 yvecrv for 1 crv and the deposit did that.


[04/06/2021 12:33 AM] pridegsu#3656
I've deposited 3300 usd and the contract give me back 2700 usd


[04/06/2021 12:33 AM] pridegsu#3656
so please explain, where are the 500usd that are missing if are not held in the contract itself


[04/06/2021 12:35 AM] pridegsu#3656
I'm a solidity dev, I know how this works... we are not popular as yearn and we still have a treasury wallet to, among a lot other stuff, take care of this kind of issues


[04/06/2021 12:37 AM] pridegsu#3656
so, again, the money is already locked in the vault so even though if you send that money back you are losing ZERO


[04/06/2021 12:37 AM] pridegsu#3656
if not, you are taking profit of a design error...


[04/06/2021 12:38 AM] vany#0365
people deposit into yvecrv vault daily, the vault gives you 1:1. yearn locks every single crv you deposit for vecrv so we dont arb anything to make money.


[04/06/2021 12:39 AM] pridegsu#3656
so you are saying that you have daily users that they like to lose 30% of their money for no reason?


[04/06/2021 12:39 AM] pridegsu#3656
I've checked the txs of that contract and most, if not all, are coming for other strategies not from EOA/users...


[04/06/2021 12:40 AM] pridegsu#3656
the 10% deposited of the CRV farmed by strategies to boost


[04/06/2021 12:40 AM] vany#0365
8.9 million crv have been deposit by people outside of yearn


[04/06/2021 12:41 AM] pridegsu#3656
the reason I'm being so picky is because I know you can do something about it


[04/06/2021 12:41 AM] pridegsu#3656
yes, that's historical data


[04/06/2021 12:41 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
that crv is forever locked in the vault


[04/06/2021 12:41 AM] vany#0365
the profit you are talking about does not exist, yearn locks the crv you deposit into vecrv forever


[04/06/2021 12:42 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
it perpetually 4 yr relocks


[04/06/2021 12:42 AM] pridegsu#3656
yes, the contract locked 3300 usd


[04/06/2021 12:42 AM] pridegsu#3656
worth of CRV


[04/06/2021 12:42 AM] pridegsu#3656
but I got 2700 usd worth of yveCRV, so, that's profit


[04/06/2021 12:42 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
locking isnt swapping


[04/06/2021 12:42 AM] vany#0365
correct, its a different function


[04/06/2021 12:43 AM] pridegsu#3656
I know very well the difference


[04/06/2021 12:43 AM] vany#0365
so already locked crv are trading at a discount vs newly deposited crv


[04/06/2021 12:44 AM] pridegsu#3656
you have locked crv worth of 3300 usd and therefore, boosting other strategies corresponding to that amount, BUT the contract have minted 2700 usd yvecrv tokens


[04/06/2021 12:44 AM] pridegsu#3656
so ...


[04/06/2021 12:46 AM] vany#0365
what people are willing to sell yvecrv on the open market does not change the 1:1 deposit ratio


[04/06/2021 12:46 AM] vany#0365
and the deposit page confirms it will give you 1:1


[04/06/2021 12:46 AM] vany#0365
if you wanted to trade for yvecrv at sushi you could, yearn does not have a way to control the sushi ratio


[04/06/2021 12:47 AM] pridegsu#3656
it's not about the market, is about the value you have locked versus the value you have minted


[04/06/2021 12:47 AM] pridegsu#3656
that's 500usd of difference


[04/06/2021 12:47 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
I think you are thinking about this all wrong in terms of who profited.  Yearn didn't profit off your error.  You could have had a better than 1:1 outcome if you swapped sushi


[04/06/2021 12:47 AM] pridegsu#3656
if it's not yearn, then who?


[04/06/2021 12:47 AM] pridegsu#3656
you have locked 3300usd and minted 2700


[04/06/2021 12:48 AM] vany#0365
you are using dollars for a contract that swaps 2 erc-20 tokens at a locked 1:1 ratio


[04/06/2021 12:49 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
that extra value is burned


[04/06/2021 12:49 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
its not earned by someone else


[04/06/2021 12:49 AM] pridegsu#3656
so let's talk about amount of ERC20 tokens, you have locked 1032 CRV, that worth 1300 yveCRV but you have minted 1032 of it


[04/06/2021 12:49 AM] vany#0365
and if the peg goes better than 1:1 you sell and extract extra value


[04/06/2021 12:49 AM] pridegsu#3656
it's not burned, it's locked to boost other strategies by the amount deposited


[04/06/2021 12:49 AM] pridegsu#3656
not less than that


[04/06/2021 12:49 AM] vany#0365
This operation is non-reversible: you can only convert CRV into yveCRV, as any deposited CRV is perpetually staked in Curve’s voting escrow.


[04/06/2021 12:50 AM] vany#0365
in your mind and ours, its no longer available to anyone


[04/06/2021 12:50 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
yes but in exchange you get a enhanced 3crv pool token cash flow stream


[04/06/2021 12:50 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
you still get that same stream, you could have gotten more of it but buying someones else's yvecrv cheaper


[04/06/2021 12:51 AM] pridegsu#3656
I know it's not reversible, what I'm expecting is that the yearn team, takes responsibility of it because If an error is done by users then it's a faulty design


[04/06/2021 12:51 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
thats not yearn's fault that you didn't buy someone else's token.  The 500 you are talking about is value you should have extracted from a yvecrv LP on sushi


[04/06/2021 12:51 AM] ONI#6888
basically, yes you could have made 20% more if you have sold your crv to buy yveCRV-dao token on sushi swap, but that is because the market is trading it below peg


[04/06/2021 12:52 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
same applies to different methods of acquiring xSUSHI, ASSY, YLA, different paths have different returns


[04/06/2021 12:52 AM] pridegsu#3656
it's not available by anyone one but you are taking advantage of that price difference to boost other strategies, so that's profit


[04/06/2021 12:52 AM] ONI#6888
no we are not


[04/06/2021 12:52 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
in exchange for enhanced 3pool rewards


[04/06/2021 12:52 AM] ONI#6888
it clearly states how the vault works on the home page


[04/06/2021 12:53 AM] ryan.miller#8768
every yveCRV in existence was minted by someone who locked CRV 1:1 like you. Only a month ago yveCRV was trading above CRV.

There is no strategy


[04/06/2021 12:55 AM] pridegsu#3656
believe me that I've even read the contract's code


[04/06/2021 12:55 AM] pridegsu#3656

[04/06/2021 12:56 AM] ryan.miller#8768
the use case is that you get better 3crv rewards than if you were to lock CRV yourself


[04/06/2021 12:56 AM] ONI#6888
then you obviously dont. Read the document it literally explains the whole vault.


[04/06/2021 12:56 AM] pridegsu#3656
exactly, it doesn't say you are not using the market price


[04/06/2021 12:57 AM] ONI#6888
`This vault converts your CRV into yveCRV at a 1:1 ratio`


[04/06/2021 12:57 AM] ONI#6888
it says this on our website


[04/06/2021 12:57 AM] pridegsu#3656
that's confusing, again, If an error is done by users then it's a faulty design


[04/06/2021 12:57 AM] ONI#6888
if you can buy it elsewhere at 1:0.8 it might be possible and at time it might be 1:1.1


[04/06/2021 12:58 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
and it used to have no ratio

so what you are doing zap in other vaults and making sure that you choose the best route?


[04/06/2021 12:58 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
hmm if only there was a 4 letter acronym that could help a bit here...


[04/06/2021 12:58 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
it hasn't been added to this yet because the vault it getting reworked


[04/06/2021 12:59 AM] pridegsu#3656
are you kidding? how a user would possible know that?


[04/06/2021 12:59 AM] ryan.miller#8768
I do think this is a fair point. But still, the text clearly describes what is happening.


[04/06/2021 12:59 AM] pridegsu#3656
that's something you guys know because you are part of the community


[04/06/2021 1:00 AM] ryan.miller#8768
It's in yearn's best interest to get more locked CRV. So that function is put front and center on the site.


[04/06/2021 1:03 AM] ryan.miller#8768
How would you like the text to be changed to make it clearer? We can make a suggestion to the web/copy team. But that's the best we can do. @pridegsu


[04/06/2021 1:04 AM] pridegsu#3656
nvm, I think I'd get a more accurate answer making a thread in twitter and asking directly to devs, doug, banteg or even andre himself

i think ryan answered you but there is no reimbursement as there was no error. the contract provided you 1:1 as intended

I think emphasizing that while non-reversible, there is exit liquidity for a significant discount.


[04/06/2021 1:23 AM] ryan.miller#8768
this is constructive, thanks.


[04/06/2021 1:27 AM] arberx#3367
Honestly even directing people to buy it directly. While short term yearn loses out on the lock up, the buying pressure would hopefully equalize the price or maybe even make the vault token more expensive (there is a gas premium to deposit)


[04/06/2021 1:27 AM] arberx#3367
I’m not too familiar though


[04/06/2021 1:31 AM] ryan.miller#8768
Yeah there was a pretty tight peg a month ago or so. YveCRV even spent some time above CRV. But we saw the big spread recently with that Coinbase listing of CRV.

[04/06/2021 1:40 AM] ryan.miller#8768
The fact that you get improved 3crv rewards + sushi rewards with yveCRV is the offer. If you don't want it then that's fine.


[04/06/2021 1:40 AM] ryan.miller#8768
A lot of people do, and think it's undervalued.


[04/06/2021 1:41 AM] TorJado#3802
It would be useful to change the UI to indicate that the minting could be more expensive than purchasing onsushiswap but the app did as advertised

another troll, why would you even have this members in the community?


[04/06/2021 1:42 AM] pridegsu#3656
you are talking about yvecrv-eth lp on uniswap + staking those lp into pickle finance?


[04/06/2021 1:43 AM] ryan.miller#8768
yes all those things are only possible with yveCRV.


[04/06/2021 1:43 AM] ryan.miller#8768
and weekly 3Crv rewards are more than you can get by locking CRV yourself.


[04/06/2021 1:44 AM] pridegsu#3656
so you are talking about it's undervalued as it's right now, we are not talking about new features or something like that, right?


[04/06/2021 1:44 AM] ryan.miller#8768
I would agree with that yes.


[04/06/2021 1:45 AM] pridegsu#3656
let's say I do all that staking


[04/06/2021 1:45 AM] pridegsu#3656
I'd still get the 3crv rewards because of having the LP tokens, right?


[04/06/2021 1:45 AM] ryan.miller#8768
nope. can't have all at the same time ... for now


[04/06/2021 1:45 AM] ryan.miller#8768
there's a new vault coming though which will change taht


[04/06/2021 1:46 AM] pridegsu#3656
pickle finance is taking those rewards and giving you pickle token (farming) as rewards then?


[04/06/2021 1:47 AM] pridegsu#3656
so would you suggest to add liquidity to the yvecrv-eth slp in sushi and holding those tokens until these new vaults are out? or just holding yvecrv?


[04/06/2021 1:47 AM] ryan.miller#8768
the 3crv rewards are lost if yvecrv is in a sushi pool


[04/06/2021 1:47 AM] vany#0365

I'm trying to deposit in the yveCRV-ETH pool CRV tokens but the "approve" never gets approved. I am using Metamask. Any tips?


[04/06/2021 4:32 PM] PabloE#0538
Hey everyone, wanted to try the vaults with a small amount of money but the gas prices are insane. What other instrument could I use? Liquidity pools? Lending?


[04/06/2021 5:03 PM] Toddof1#0919
are you using a hardware wallet? if so make sure the eth app is open before you click approve.


[04/06/2021 5:05 PM] Toddof1#0919
I deposited YFI into the yearn YFI vault a couple of months ago but haven't seen the "deposited" amount going up at all from the rewards. Has anyone else ben experiencing this and do any of the admins know why this might be the case?


[04/06/2021 5:10 PM] impostor#7777
gas is going to be expensive no matter what, sorry sir we only allow you to full send on eth


[04/06/2021 5:12 PM] PabloE#0538
From which amounts do you think a deposit starts bing profitable in general?


[04/06/2021 5:12 PM] impostor#7777
depends on lockup time, and your APY will be greatly reduced if you have a small amount


[04/06/2021 5:13 PM] PabloE#0538
Over a year maybe?


[04/06/2021 5:13 PM] impostor#7777
I mean if it is costing you $200 in gas fees (and that is at current eth price) for fluctuating between 15-30% apy just to get in


[04/06/2021 5:14 PM] impostor#7777
like 5k for 1 year+ and price of gas to get out is of course a variable as well, if eth continues up with no fee abatement


[04/06/2021 5:14 PM] impostor#7777
you're cutting your apy in half pretty much if it is 15% or less


[04/06/2021 5:15 PM] PabloE#0538
15% of what?


[04/06/2021 5:16 PM] impostor#7777
if your overall apy is 15%


[04/06/2021 5:16 PM] impostor#7777
and you're putting in 5k, fees are slashing the APY in half if not more


[04/06/2021 5:16 PM] PabloE#0538
Ok, got it


[04/06/2021 5:16 PM] impostor#7777
the average user for WETH/ETH vaults has approx 130k in it


[04/06/2021 5:17 PM] impostor#7777
and that is a cheaper vault to go in/out of


[04/06/2021 5:17 PM] impostor#7777
I would recommend 10k as a mininum and that makes your timeline 1 year minimum as well


[04/06/2021 5:17 PM] PabloE#0538
Ok, thanks for the help!


[04/06/2021 5:18 PM] PabloE#0538
Are there other instruments with lower recommended minimums?


[04/06/2021 5:18 PM] impostor#7777
I mean gas fees are pretty constant


[04/06/2021 5:18 PM] PabloE#0538
Right


[04/06/2021 5:18 PM] impostor#7777
contracts are expensive to use, so even liquidity providing / mining is the same


[04/06/2021 5:18 PM] impostor#7777
especially with approval / stake fees, if you are sub 10k you want to be cognizant and enter during a low gas phase


[04/06/2021 5:19 PM] impostor#7777
like the best may be something super simple like sushi staking in the bar, but dyor


[04/06/2021 5:19 PM] impostor#7777
single token staking is probably the most gas efficient defi option


[04/06/2021 5:20 PM] impostor#7777
but I would ask #📈speculation  or #🙃off-topic


[04/06/2021 5:20 PM] PabloE#0538

yeah just checked its V2


[04/06/2021 5:50 PM] Toddof1#0919

[04/06/2021 5:50 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
maybe month and a half, but just wanted to make sure


[04/06/2021 5:50 PM] Toddof1#0919
yeah something like that


[04/06/2021 5:51 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
was it going up before and just stopped


[04/06/2021 5:51 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
or never went up at all?


[04/06/2021 5:51 PM] Toddof1#0919
never went up at all


[04/06/2021 5:52 PM] Toddof1#0919
a friend of mine is having the same issue, and he's deposited DAI in the yearn DAI vault and that is going up but his YFI is staying the same


[04/06/2021 5:53 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
I personally am in the yfi vault and have seen it go up although for the last 2 weeks yields  have been very slow because bank farming ended and waiting for more dai to better utilize yfi vault.


[04/06/2021 5:53 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
hmmm


[04/06/2021 5:53 PM] Toddof1#0919
hmm


[04/06/2021 5:54 PM] Toddof1#0919
is there a minimum you can deposit before you get rewards? my deposit was  0.31 YFI which is a lot for me but probably not much for most traders


[04/06/2021 5:54 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
no all amount do


[04/06/2021 5:54 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
no minimum


[04/06/2021 5:55 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
i think i know the issue


[04/06/2021 5:55 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
let me check 1 thing.  hold on


[04/06/2021 5:55 PM] Toddof1#0919
thanks!


[04/06/2021 5:58 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
here's my best guess although i could be wrong.  If you have 0.31 to get to .32 (yearn only shows 2 decimal places) you would need a gross 3.2% return (could be more/less due to rounding).  That means if you were in it for 1 month you would need an annualized 38.4% return for the duration to show an increase.  If you were in it at the start during the BDP farming I'm surprised its not showing an increase


[04/06/2021 5:58 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
however if you deposited after bdp farming ended it makes sense.  The last month net return probably below 38%


[04/06/2021 5:59 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
if we shows up to 4 decimals you would probably see movement, but the 2 decimals limits it


[04/06/2021 5:59 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
That's my best guess, but I know the vault is working properly


[04/06/2021 6:00 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
UI improvements coming on this issue.


[04/06/2021 6:00 PM] Toddof1#0919
okay i think you're probably right!

Is there insurance for yearn vaults available? On the website, protect tab its not possible to buy claim-tokens for yearn.


[04/06/2021 7:35 PM] GEBucky#1736
I am confunsed on how USDP is being priced, unless it's somehow just pulling from CoinGecko. My "card" on Curve.fi shows a usd balance of $121K (ish). This is the same amount on Zapper, and roughtly how many USDC I would receive upon withdraw.

[04/06/2021 7:36 PM] GEBucky#1736
I deposited, about a week ago, quite a bit more than that, and as the drill chart shows I have closer to 125K crvUSDN, which would be about right. Why the discrepancy, and why does the front card (and Zapper) change between $120K and $125K periodically? The price of USNP on Curve has stayed around $1 the entire time. Nothing on the Curve pool indicates that CRVUSDN has ever dropped below $1 in value. Virtual price has been right around 1.02x

Zapper sucks that’s why


[04/06/2021 7:54 PM] arberx#3367
Jk but zapper doesn’t calculate it right


[04/06/2021 7:55 PM] arberx#3367
Rn unfortunately yearn.fi is the best UI to calculate. You could also use the share price from yearn.science to calculate it manually


[04/06/2021 7:55 PM] arberx#3367
Seems yearn v3 UI is coming out soon though 👀 we’ll see what that does


[04/06/2021 8:03 PM] GEBucky#1736
Thanks - but it's odd that Yearn doesn't calculate it right either (first card I posted). Easy enough to figure out it is wrong so not too worried. Was just a but of a "moment" first time the balance dropped 5K. I can just take the CRVUSDP and multiply by virtual price - close enough. Thanks for the help. I just wonder if Zapper would actually only give you the $121K or if once it had the CRVUSDP shares it would have figured it out. I am certainly going to try.


[04/06/2021 10:43 PM] Charles#2038

so the pool tokens are not 1:1 busd, they gain value from the farms compounding for you. as you see in the picture 1 yybCRV is worth about $1.244

Hi, trying to understand the vaults transaction fees - so when I click on approve on USDC vault of yfi, it shows me $17 as fees, but when I see gas tracker - https://etherscan.io/gastracker, it shows ~$5 as average transaction fees. So why is this difference between the fees?


[04/07/2021 7:18 AM] j.#6352
The ~$5 average is for the most basic Ethereum transaction of sending ETH. Anything else more complicated than that like smart contract operations, ERC tokens, and many others will need more gas

I tried earlier to deposit IHF to a vault - i accepted the spend limit and the transaction went through but it didn't show up as being available


[04/07/2021 2:41 PM] Dirk#1605
Can anyone help me?  I'm trying to move that out of my account now

Hi there, quick question: If I put my CRV into the veCRV "Backscratcher" Vault and then do the full menu ==> Stakes this yveCRV in the yveCRV-ETH SLP on SushiSwap ==> Deposits this SLP into the yveCRV-ETH pJar on Pickle Finance. Will I still be able to claim my weekly 3CRV rewards?


[04/07/2021 3:39 PM] Dirk#1605
I've been a victim of fraud just now trying to deposit money to one of the vaults


[04/07/2021 3:39 PM] Dirk#1605
I've lost a lot of money


[04/07/2021 3:41 PM] Dirk#1605
There was an issue with the deposit, so I followed the webiste to go to the telegram and there was listed Official Support.  I had no way of knowing this was a PM and it was immediate when I clicked on the link.  I went through some diagnostic steps when they asked me to enter my wallet details on the website.  I wasn't sure about this so I checked on the main telegram and someone there confirmed it was ok.


[04/07/2021 3:41 PM] Dirk#1605
I put my details in and they emptied my account


[04/07/2021 3:58 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
really sorry this happened, but unfortunately I don't think there is anything that can be done

Has this been reported by anyone else before?


[04/07/2021 4:44 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
There is a significant effort by discord/tg to keep spammers and scammers out of the channels, but it doesn't catch every one unfortunately.

The only full-proof protection is to never give out your private key to anyone/ever.  Don't keep in on electronic media or enter into a field anywhere.

if you can send along the details of the person who told you on TG it was ok we can see if an admin can ban that account.

You can now vote with YFI in your wallet, yvYFI, Bancor, Balancer, Uniswap, Sushiswap, MakerDAO and Unit.

A reminder to withdraw your YFI from governance staking and migrate v1 yYFI to v2 yvYFI.

i staked in ygov V2, is that just for collecting fees now?

it used to be, but fees were turned off after the buyback/build vote


[04/08/2021 11:00 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
it basically has no purpose at the moment


[04/08/2021 11:01 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
best place to earn for yfi is probably the v2 yfi vault.  it does yield farming similar to the ETH vault

hi team, I'm investigating to zap ETH into the `yveCRV - ETH` vault... and am being shown a gas fee of 491... is this to be expected? I understand it might be doing more than just a single transaction, but it does look extremely high.

[04/08/2021 11:16 AM] j.#6352
It does a few things: swap half of your ETH to yveCRV, deposit 50/50 ETH/yveCRV into Sushiswap, deposit SLP into Pickle jar. I'm not sure if it should be that high at current gwei, but it cant be massively lower than that with all the operations done


[04/08/2021 11:18 AM] ape-ron#9334
so at the end, what you have is a pickle token ? And when you withdraw, it undoes all of this?


[04/08/2021 11:21 AM] j.#6352
you'll have pSLP. You may stake in the Pickle farm after for extra yield


[04/08/2021 11:21 AM] j.#6352
No. When you withdraw, you'll have to go do the Pickle website as your tokens are in Pickle


[04/08/2021 11:22 AM] j.#6352
Withdrawing from the Pickle Jar, not Farm, will get you your ETH/yveCRV SLP back


[04/08/2021 11:28 AM] ape-ron#9334
and then the ETH/yveCRV SLP can be withdrawn from the yearn farm at this point?


[04/08/2021 11:30 AM] ape-ron#9334
or I guess then I need to go to Sushisawp to withdraw it...


[04/08/2021 11:30 AM] ape-ron#9334
This is far more complicated then what I've been doing so far so thanks a lot for answering the questions, really appreciate it 🙂

No

yeah tbh you shouldn't need to know this obscure detail. it is something we are fixing very soon.


[04/08/2021 11:36 AM] ryan.miller#8768
i would suggest you not use this zap and just hold until yvBOOST is released


[04/08/2021 11:36 AM] ape-ron#9334
eta?


[04/08/2021 11:37 AM] ape-ron#9334
I actually like understanding details, though.


[04/08/2021 11:37 AM] ape-ron#9334
good or bad 🙂


[04/08/2021 11:38 AM] ryan.miller#8768
Nice. If you use the zap, you will likely want to make another expensive txn to zap back out soon once announced.


[04/08/2021 11:39 AM] ryan.miller#8768
so might want to just hang tight until yvBOOST is announced.


[04/08/2021 11:40 AM] ape-ron#9334
i'll probably wait, then. Because going in and out would cost me probably north of $300, so trying to avoid that if I can. It's not negligible. yvBOOST should be announced when?


[04/08/2021 11:41 AM] ryan.miller#8768
Not sure exactly. It's ready to go, just needs to be endorsed by governance.


[04/08/2021 11:42 AM] ape-ron#9334
where is the docs on it?


[04/08/2021 11:42 AM] ryan.miller#8768
less than a week for sure i'd imagine


[04/08/2021 11:42 AM] ape-ron#9334

[04/08/2021 11:42 AM] ape-ron#9334

Hey all. I've been scouring the websites but not having any luck. Hoping you all can help me.

Thinking of putting some ETH and dpi in to borrow some stable coins against.
Where can I find out about the max amount to be able to borrow (10%, 30%, 50% of collateral?).
Also, in the case of my collateral value dropping, is there a fee for the liquidation? How can I find that information?

Yes. But due to current ethereum gas fees, doing that with $300 is never going to be worth it, not even if you keep them in there for a year

[04/09/2021 12:37 AM] vany#0365
yeah it should be the same steps. the only extra cost vs zap is going to be token approvals. but with gas under 100 gwei token approvals are like $15 each


[04/09/2021 12:42 AM] KEI#1898
So I am not migrating either.


[04/09/2021 12:54 AM] KEI#1898
By the way, is the withdrawal fee zero if I move to v2 through migration?

you can check the fees next to the vault you are in by hovering over V1

I once saw Andre building a... Fantom cross chain swap thing?
I'm kind of stuck atm as I transferred some Ether to BSC, and have 0 BNB.
I suppose this isn't technically a Yearn related issue, but I'd trust anyone from Yearn more than anyone from Binance.

Is there any immediate way to purchase/trade/acquire BNB? I have enough ETH to purchase some BNB. Not sure where to look...


[04/09/2021 5:49 AM] kilogold#7310
I haven't done any KYC with Binance so it will take days before I can just buy some BNB the typical way.


[04/09/2021 5:51 AM] Johnny F#4404
You dont need to to KYC on the international binance (not sure about the US one), if you dont withdraw more than a pretty big amount (i think it was 2 BTC?) each day.


[04/09/2021 5:51 AM] Johnny F#4404
the other way is to use the binance bridge to get some assets from ETH over to the BSC chain, there's an option to swap a part of that to BNB to avoid exactly your problem


[04/09/2021 6:00 AM] kilogold#7310
Yeeeaap! That latter part is what I overlooked.


[04/09/2021 6:01 AM] kilogold#7310

[04/09/2021 6:46 AM] kilogold#7310
If I want to simply throw this BNB into my wallet, I need to do a BEP2 transaction, right?

As in 
* BEP2 == Gas == BSC/BNB == Ethereum/ETH... 
* BEP20 == token == Ethereum/ERC20....

Is this accurate? Sorry, I know this is not the right place for this kind of support. First time using BSC and I'm at the finish line here.

[04/09/2021 3:39 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
@0xVerve Yes I tried it on yfi vault.  I have already deposited previously so this was not an approve tx for me.


[04/09/2021 3:39 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
Have you deposited to that vault previously?


[04/09/2021 3:41 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
so you shouldn't need to re-approve this should be a deposit tx


[04/09/2021 3:41 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
hmmm


[04/09/2021 3:43 PM] Johnny F#4404
do you have enough ETH in your wallet for a "normal" transaction fee? That sometimes also leads to a faulty display of TX costs


[04/09/2021 3:46 PM] Johnny F#4404
just tried it on my side: working, just as @HAtTip3675 says as well. So probably not a server-side problem.
Another thing: did you maybe forget to enter the actual amount to be deposited? If I accidently leave it at 0, I can reproduce the error as well


[04/09/2021 3:47 PM] Johnny F#4404
and another possibility: sometimes there's rounding errors. If you deposit 99.98 maybe in reality you just have 99.976 and the UI might not handle it correctly. Can you try rounding it down a little? (for me, max always worked though)


[04/09/2021 3:48 PM] Johnny F#4404
If that's not it either, I'm out of ideas here


[04/09/2021 3:53 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
if you are comfortable can you send a screenshot of the approval request.  or feel free to pm if you feel more comfortable that way


[04/09/2021 4:22 PM] Johnny F#4404
If you find the problem, would be nice to let us know what it was. Always trying to learn.


[04/09/2021 5:40 PM] Trash Panda#5661
Hi, I was wondering why, while all the other vaults have a regular gas fee, ETH approval requires about 1.17 ETH for some reason while WETH and USDC is like $13?


[04/09/2021 6:09 PM] 87CSD#6839
I've had about 0.18 yfi in the original v1 vault for well over 6 months, it barely earned anything, then 29 days ago moved it over to v2, and I've noticed over that time via the zerion website that my yfi value is actually going down on value! Every couple of weeks, the 5th decimal point has decreased by 1. I know it's not alot, but considering during this last month the Apr has been in the range of 5-130%, I should have seen some growth by now, and definitely not have it decreasing. I'm hoping someone can help explain / fix this for me :(


[04/09/2021 6:11 PM] arberx#3367
Zapper/Zerion don’t calculate vault earnings well. Look at yearn.fi, what does it say


[04/09/2021 6:11 PM] arberx#3367
You can also calculate it manually


[04/09/2021 6:19 PM] ataros#7107
how do I determine the value of the crvIB token?


[04/09/2021 6:27 PM] 87CSD#6839
Yearn.fi and yearn.fianance both arent much use to me as they only go to 2 decimal places, so until I see that 0.18 grow to a 0.19, I won't be able to see my yfi grow.


[04/10/2021 10:08 AM] xfgdv#5789
same issues here..i guess the real cost is much less...just metamask at least assumes like 11M of gas usage...i just did it manually...costed basically 100$..:/ but at least it is done...also I got an error/warning : "ALERT: Transaktionsfehler. Fehler in Vertragscode eingefügt."


[04/10/2021 11:59 AM] jjardon#8614
Hi, Im trying to put DAI in the v2 DAI vault but seems I have to pay ~1.2 in ETH ; is this expected? (the v1 DAI vault only ask for 0.006 ETH)


[04/10/2021 6:38 PM] binaryalgorithm#2665
https://v1.yearn.finance/lending , I don't know if its yearn or cream issue, but when I set USDC as collateral and then deposited 9600, and refreshed the page a couple times to make sure it updated after txn was completed, I got no borrow limit from it. Do we know why that can be?


[04/10/2021 6:39 PM] binaryalgorithm#2665
I took most of it out but the little bit of tokens should technically allow me to borrow 0.01 (just on principal)

If that’s on zapper probably best to ask on their discord

I unrolled it manually, it was 150$ vs. 300$ to just decompose into all 3 stablecoins


[04/11/2021 2:43 AM] buffadada#8876
Same issue for me but in my case I'm trying to deposit into the WBTC vault. Anyone know why it's throwing an error? Using the yearn.finance interface it shows "Vault deposit limit reached", but there's only 21 BTC in the vault, so surely that's not the case?


[04/11/2021 2:49 AM] buffadada#8876
Seems it actually is the case! https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1361479481395929090

Token pickling SushiSwap LP Token. I have these lp tokens  how can I remove from this lp position .... I can’t see a withdraw option on yearn vault or pickle .... I started by providing crv in year at yveCRV - ETH


[04/11/2021 5:25 AM] ONI#6888
Are you in the pickle jar or farm, or in the sushi pool?


[04/11/2021 5:25 AM] ONI#6888
Should tell you on zapper.fi


[04/11/2021 5:26 AM] ONI#6888
You can manually unwind it if you want or zap out on zapper too

[04/11/2021 2:27 PM] Merkyah#1940
Could someone let me know if I'm on the right track for depositing into a vault?
I believe I have done everything correctly?

I've deposted ETH into the yveCRV - ETH Vault
Then i had "Available Pickle LP : 0.4" and then Deposited that. I go to https://app.pickle.finance/farms and i see this.
So it seems ive put into this pickle vault for "Back Scratcher
pSLP yveCRV" correctly?

However, here is my wallet https://etherscan.io/address/0x60D3E87FA17cC11035Abd3248566E8bEda85cf14#tokentxns

and I see the following. I feel I should be seeing one more PICKLE token in my ERC20 Tokens?

[04/11/2021 2:32 PM] j.#6352
Staking your pSLP removes it from your wallet. You won't see an ERC20 that represents this like the usual LP or vault tokens


[04/11/2021 2:32 PM] j.#6352
If you've staked in anything before like when you farm SUSHI, it's the same. You don't hold the SLP in your wallet


[04/11/2021 2:53 PM] Merkyah#1940
I have never staked anything before ever. So this is why maybe its a bit more confusing to me, as I was thinking i was staking into a 'normal' vault


[04/11/2021 2:53 PM] Merkyah#1940
thank you @j. .
Just to confirm.... so everything looks right in my wallet? And I'd be able to withdraw from https://app.pickle.finance/farms when i feel the need?


[04/11/2021 2:55 PM] j.#6352
Correct. After depositing in the Jar and staking in the Farm, you should only see your balance in the pickle website, which is the page you just linked. Yes you can withdraw from there whenever you want.

V2 has management fee of 2% and performance fee of 20%


[04/11/2021 3:30 PM] gwenace#4655
The growth for ETH is showing 6.34%


[04/11/2021 3:30 PM] gwenace#4655

Does migration of crvHBTC from v1 to v2 require a lot of gas cost? Or is it going to be fixed? Please check it out. That way, we will decide whether to migrate or withdraw.

Hey guys, here's a potentially noob question to which I didn't find any answer yet: Some days ago I made a deposit in the USDC vault on yearn.finance (by depositing USDC). However, I didn't receive any type of yUSDC coin back in my wallet. Am I missing something? I used the link in the documents page to add yUSD to my wallet and I do see the amount I deposited in the 'vault balance'. I even tried making a withdrawn and a deposit again just to test. Cheers!


[04/12/2021 6:18 AM] ONI#6888
yUSD is the yCRV vault's token

Try to refresh your cookies and reconnect your account. If it still doesn't work you might need to go to zapper.fi and raise the slippage limit to 2% or 3%


[04/12/2021 10:22 AM] RooSteel#5405
from the Yearn.finance, nothing happens. If i got to zapper to do it, i get the error message. I put slippage up to 3%

Is this an approve tx or a deposit x?


[04/12/2021 3:43 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
you need to approve using tokens in your wallet first, then the 2nd tx is a deposit.  Notice the screenshot says 'approve'

[04/12/2021 3:44 PM] jon_snow#5610
With the high fees to take profit it’s not easy


[04/12/2021 3:44 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
that didn't actually transfer any tokens


[04/12/2021 3:44 PM] Majestic#5075
but my BUSD is stil the same amount in my wallet, so what would I have to do now?


[04/12/2021 3:45 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
every time you interact with a new contract and are transferring an ERC-20 (ie: DAI, USD) you first need to approve the contract to use the ERC-20 token

as long as the approval tx went through you should now be able to deposit.  The approval is a one time action, (not every time you deposit)


[04/12/2021 3:46 PM] Majestic#5075
I did this transaction already 3 times actually, and i definitely remember having the Deposit button so i have done that step actually


[04/12/2021 3:47 PM] Majestic#5075
I see the Deposit button now also, but did this step 3 times already at least


[04/12/2021 3:47 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
did the transaction go through or are they pending?


[04/12/2021 3:47 PM] Majestic#5075
they went trhough


[04/12/2021 3:47 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
and you still see the BUSD in your wallet?

[04/12/2021 3:47 PM] Majestic#5075
yes


[04/12/2021 3:47 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
did you hit max/enter the amount you want to deposit in the field?


[04/12/2021 3:48 PM] Majestic#5075
yes


[04/12/2021 3:48 PM] Majestic#5075
i deposited my max BUSD


[04/12/2021 3:48 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
if you want you can pm the tx hasg


[04/12/2021 3:48 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
i'll take a look


[04/12/2021 3:48 PM] Majestic#5075
OK, I wil do that, really appreciate this help!

Hi, i tried deposit USDC on V2 vault via yearn.fi console. It was showing an option of opting for 1 GWEI gas for SLOW transfer. I m not sure what to expect with this feature. Does it pool various transactions? what's the typical wait time? It shows gave me the transaction id: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd1becbbad4589784601ec598f724bfbf14944e51ba6330b12ed83898e0420ae1 but it does not show anything there. Here is the image of the feature i used:

[04/12/2021 3:56 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Its an estimate, you are very unlikely to have a 1GWEI transaction succeeded


[04/12/2021 3:56 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
1 GWEI too low, probably a bug


[04/12/2021 3:58 PM] vj#9057
ohk. thanks. it keeps showing pending spinner on my coinbase wallet. any idea how to cancel the transaction?


[04/12/2021 4:00 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Not sure about coinbase wallet specifically


[04/12/2021 4:00 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
But you can increase the gas on existing transactions


[04/12/2021 4:01 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Or cancel existing transactions but with a real amount of gas


[04/12/2021 4:01 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Or just wait for the transaction to get dropped


[04/12/2021 4:03 PM] vj#9057
got it. will just wait in that case. thanks for the help. I got excited thinking that yearn might have developed some feature to pool multiple transactions to reduce the gas cost 😆


[04/12/2021 4:42 PM] polygondream#1296
if I deposit CRV into the CRV vault and receive the 1:1 ratio of yveCRV how exactly do I claim these rewards?


[04/12/2021 4:43 PM] vany#0365
I like to use https://crv.ape.tax


[04/12/2021 4:44 PM] polygondream#1296
I saw that too but couldn't find it listed on the main vaults page


[04/12/2021 4:52 PM] polygondream#1296
and I'm guessing this vault yveCRV - ETH abstracts the whole stake process involving sushi swap and pickle.finance


[04/12/2021 4:55 PM] polygondream#1296

Hello

I have deposited two different amounts of USDC using two different wallets to the yearn USDC V2 vault. I appear to have been credited with the yvusdc for both transactions as well. However nothing has changed after that. I don't see where I am making any earnings nor any type of dashboard other than the plain https://yearn.finance/vaults page with the original value of USDC I deposited in the deposited column. Can someone please provide some guidance on what I should expect to see in terms of earnings/deposit performance? Is there a real-time dashboard or other place I can track progress?

Other info that might help...

The API /vaults/all returns only 12 assets, how to get all of them?


[04/12/2021 9:55 PM] eugenie98#1296
cant seem to zap out of vaults to eth?


[04/12/2021 10:02 PM] eugenie98#1296
also, do I need to unpickle and the un-lp my yvecrv right before each snapshot to get the eps airdrop or does the airdrop see through to the lp provider?


[04/12/2021 10:03 PM] vany#0365
yearn hold the vecrv so it does not go to sushi, yearn is still voting on how to handle the EPS airdrop


[04/12/2021 10:05 PM] vany#0365
the YIP being voted on is a general set up for current and future airdrops. once that is finalized gov can use the options on the yip on how to handle EPS


[04/12/2021 10:06 PM] eugenie98#1296
i understand that part


[04/12/2021 10:07 PM] eugenie98#1296
ahh ok


[04/12/2021 10:09 PM] eugenie98#1296
yearn holds the vecrv. so yearn receives the eps airdrop from ellipsis. if yearn had chosen to re-airdrop the ellipsis eps airdrop then we have a question of how it gets to those who deposited yvecrv in the lp.


[04/12/2021 10:10 PM] eugenie98#1296
so option A presented by banteg is getting the thumbs up or down in yip 60


[04/12/2021 10:11 PM] vany#0365
there are ways to snapshot stuff like that, but the decision on what we are doing with EPS is still up in the air


[04/12/2021 10:11 PM] ONI#6888
A fix is going out for this issue, thanks for bringing it to our attention. As soon as the multisig signs the transaction, the migrate zap should work again, sorry about that. Trx 452 on the multisig wallet.


[04/12/2021 10:12 PM] eugenie98#1296
(option A being getting more vecrv using proceeds and putting thumb on the crv rewards scale for the yvecrv vault)


[04/12/2021 10:13 PM] ONI#6888
https://vaults.finance/all this one?


[04/12/2021 10:14 PM] eugenie98#1296
(option B, which isnt in yip60 but was the alternative prsented by banteg, being a re-airdrop of some sort)


[04/12/2021 10:15 PM] ONI#6888
We currently don't have a good dashboard to show v2 realized gains, but the apy you see on the site is accurate for what it describes (1 week/ sometimes 1 month). If you go to yearn.finance you can see your balance increase as harvest is called.


[04/12/2021 10:15 PM] ONI#6888
This might have your vault https://trackavault.com


[04/12/2021 10:15 PM] vany#0365
pretty sure this is the likely direction

[04/13/2021 2:45 AM] Xtrino#3810
Thank you for the eedback. I hope a dashboard or something gets developed in the near future. The trackvault.com site does appear to work and show the deposit's progress.


[04/13/2021 5:59 AM] 0xfarmer#5374
may be a dumb question! saw @banteg tweet about the new v2 strategies using BAG - it sounded like they were live but I'm not seeing a difference in yield yet. Are they still rolling out?


[04/13/2021 7:45 AM] ONI#6888
They rolled out already, these are the current apy's for the bag farm https://vfat.tools/bag/


[04/13/2021 7:49 AM] 0xfarmer#5374
tks - where can we see what's under the hood with the v2 vaults to track it directly?

hey guys has anybody used multichain.xyz to swap $UNI from ethereum to BSC?


[04/13/2021 10:25 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
@Unknown hey


[04/13/2021 10:25 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
in order to interact with any contract you need to do a 1 time approval to allows the contract to use your funds


[04/13/2021 10:25 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
you likely did this


[04/13/2021 10:25 AM] Master8#4664
yes, pretty confident i did that


[04/13/2021 10:25 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
then you need to do a second transaction which actually deposits the funds


[04/13/2021 10:25 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
the approval is a one-time thing


[04/13/2021 10:26 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
not each time you deposit


[04/13/2021 10:26 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
but if you want to spend a different ERC-20 token you will need to approve each one in the future


[04/13/2021 10:26 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
the USDC should show up in parenthesis on the right side


[04/13/2021 10:26 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
and a corresponding amount of yUSDC as well.  the yUSDC amount may not be the same as the USDC balance


[04/13/2021 10:27 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
try that and see if it works


[04/13/2021 10:27 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
if you want to confirm feel free to pm with the tx hash if you are comfortable doing that


[04/13/2021 10:27 AM] Master8#4664
ok, so now im looking at that screenshot you sent me.. but with usdc balance. What do i have to do to start earning the earn yield ?


[04/13/2021 10:27 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
in parenthesis?


[04/13/2021 10:27 AM] Master8#4664
yes


[04/13/2021 10:28 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
so you did the deposit and now you have yUSDC amount and your USDC is in parenthesis?  sorry to ask again but just want to confirm


[04/13/2021 10:29 AM] Master8#4664
i did the deposit, and i have USDC in the left parenthesis and 0 yUSDC in the right parenthesis

[04/13/2021 10:34 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
after the transaction on the right side you should have some amount of yUSDC, the USDC deposited in the right parenthesis and the left side that says balance is the USDC still in your wallet


[04/13/2021 10:34 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
is that accurately reflected?


[04/13/2021 10:35 AM] Master8#4664
after which transaction ? the only transaction i did was to deposit usdc


[04/13/2021 10:36 AM] Master8#4664
whats the 3 step guide to starting earning yield on earn ?
what i did  so far is: connect wallet, send usdc


[04/13/2021 10:37 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
its 3 steps.  connect wallet.  process approve transaction, process deposit transaction


[04/13/2021 10:37 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
I think you did 1 and 2, but not 3


[04/13/2021 10:37 AM] Master8#4664
so how do i do 3 ?


[04/13/2021 10:37 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
the same way you did 2 except instead of it being an approve transaction, it will be a deposit.


[04/13/2021 10:37 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
enter balance to deposit and click earn


[04/13/2021 10:38 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
should come up with a transaction to deposit those funds


[04/13/2021 10:38 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
the first time you didn't actually deposit anything, you likely just approved the contract's ability to process USDC out of your wallet and into the contract


[04/13/2021 10:38 AM] Master8#4664
indeed, as i see the balance on my wallet


[04/13/2021 10:39 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
try that and let me know if it works


[04/13/2021 10:40 AM] Master8#4664
when i do this, it shows the blue light interface thing on the top of the page for awhile but it dont get the usual confirmation on my wallet to approve.. will try another browser


[04/13/2021 10:40 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
which wallet do you use?  metamask?


[04/13/2021 10:40 AM] Master8#4664
trustwallet


[04/13/2021 10:40 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
ok


[04/13/2021 10:41 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
I haven't used that wallet before so I can't help on the wallet side, but I see no reason why it shouldn't work


[04/13/2021 10:41 AM] Master8#4664
ive used before


[04/13/2021 10:42 AM] Master8#4664
ok.. so on another browser i actually get the notification to confirm transaction


[04/13/2021 10:43 AM] Master8#4664
with that said, if i move more funds to my wallet, i wont need to pay gas to "process approve transaction" anymore ? only to "process deposit transaction" ?


[04/13/2021 10:47 AM] TrueScotsman#8009

any users of unit protocol who can answer the below question - trying to figure out what "it capitalizes during every action" actually means..

**Stability fee, %** - represents the cost of USDP debt per year. It capitalizes during every action, which reduces debt/collateral ratio like withdrawing collateral and borrowing more USDP.


[04/13/2021 3:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have like 4k stuck in the yTUSD vault. When I try to WD it, it says it requires like 7 million as its gas limit which comes out to like a 1000 fee. Does anyone know if this gas limit is really required? Normally I don't fuck with the gas limit but it seems insane that it would req 7m gas.

I have a similar problem with the aLINK vault.


[04/13/2021 5:38 PM] DigitalNomadKaz#6614
Hope I’m in the right spot to ask for help with the v1 earn function. I swapped some Dai into YDai a few ago and thought from there the protocol would do different lending’s however over the past 3 weeks nothing has happened and I have made no return. The ydai is just sitting there

the only way to tell what is going on is to look at your original tx hash and see what the price per share was at entry vs what it is now


[04/13/2021 5:57 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
if you want you can pm me the tx hash and I can take a look


[04/13/2021 5:58 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
my guess is you should have earned about 4 DAI if you were in for a few weeks based on recent rates


[04/13/2021 5:58 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
your ydai would stay the same


[04/13/2021 5:59 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
and your underlying DAI balance would have appreicated by a few dai


[04/13/2021 6:00 PM] DigitalNomadKaz#6614

[04/13/2021 6:49 PM] vany#0365
how much gas did it recommend?


[04/13/2021 6:50 PM] vany#0365
im showing estimated gas on MM as 162403


[04/13/2021 7:49 PM] MaxP#8192
gas limit was 155,784


[04/13/2021 7:50 PM] MaxP#8192
used 97% and failed out


[04/13/2021 8:49 PM] vany#0365
hm weird, might have been an estimation error. if you set the gas limit up a bit above what i showed im guessing it will be enough


[04/13/2021 10:38 PM] Cristobal93#6634
Hi! I deposited on the crvUST vault about 48 hours ago and the amount shown on the website has not grown a single dollar, I’m guessing it may be due the low total amount deposited on the vault (about 1M) and maybe because of that it takes longer to gather enough CRV to sell?


[04/13/2021 10:41 PM] meyerwolf#6763
What am I missing? Went on yearn.finance, connected my wallet to deposit USDC. Click "Deposit". On my wallet had a notification to pay the gas fee, paid it (I can see it completed on etherscan), then it just didn't do anything. If I click on "deposit" it wants me to pay again


[04/13/2021 10:43 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
You need 2 transactions to deposit, one to approve and one to move into the vault


[04/13/2021 10:44 PM] meyerwolf#6763
oh


[04/13/2021 10:45 PM] meyerwolf#6763
so I need to do the exact same action again from yearn?


[04/13/2021 10:45 PM] meyerwolf#6763
I click deposit, pay the new fee and it will automatically know I paid the first one correct?


[04/13/2021 10:47 PM] meyerwolf#6763
I am buying into this but obv paying more in fees than a whole year of interest is dumb on my part


[04/13/2021 10:51 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Once your token is approved in one transaction, any after should deposit into the vault


[04/13/2021 10:58 PM] meyerwolf#6763
Thanks! It worked. (Is it normal that my wallet still has all the USDC in it + USDC yVault?).


[04/13/2021 11:01 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
no, that doesn't seem normal


[04/13/2021 11:01 PM] bakkerthehacker#1350
does yearn.finance show anything in "Deposited" for your vault?


[04/13/2021 11:01 PM] meyerwolf#6763

you can double check on ethplorer.io

[04/14/2021 5:00 AM] ONI#6888
you can check on https://etherscan.io/

Hi, I deposited a total of 2.2929 YFI into the YFI yVault (which became 2.247 yvYFI) on the 1st and 2nd April and can see those transactions in the zapper.fi history.  But where do I view the earnings?  Is the value in the "Deposited" column supposed to grow as earnings are made (if it is, then 2 decimal places is not enough on that screen for something like YFI)?


[04/14/2021 5:45 AM] ONI#6888
For now you might try https://trackavault.com/

Thanks folk, that's given me a direction.  Cheers.


[04/14/2021 9:51 AM] ayybee#0185
how often are funds distributed to your balance in yearn v2 vaults? If i move my funds out with a pending amount owed to me (but yet to be dispersed) how does that work?


[04/14/2021 9:53 AM] ayybee#0185
are the APYs displayed here accurate or the ones on yearn.finance? seems to be disparity


[04/14/2021 9:54 AM] ONI#6888
You can hover over the growth on the website and it will tell your the time frame for the apy calculations


[04/14/2021 9:55 AM] ONI#6888
For the main site it's weekly and possibly monthly.


[04/14/2021 9:55 AM] ONI#6888
I believe trackavault shows a few different time frames for apy


[04/14/2021 10:01 AM] ayybee#0185
so how is it that the APYs are so different between the 2? for example, USDC on yearn shows growth of 16% but on trackvault shows 30. normally i would guess the difference is one accounts for compounding and the other doesnt....but both of these seem to indicate APY, neither is APR


[04/14/2021 10:02 AM] ayybee#0185
does trackvault not take into account fees or something? just trying to figure out which is more accurate


[04/14/2021 10:04 AM] ayybee#0185
@ONI any guidance on this one?


[04/14/2021 10:09 AM] ONI#6888
Again trackavault could show daily apy while yearn shows weekly, I can tell you yearns calculations are accurate for what they are showing, no idea about trackavault


[04/14/2021 10:10 AM] ONI#6888
Trackavault is a user made site, yearn.finance is the official site.

Is there a way to know how much CRV certain vault has “won”?


[04/14/2021 10:45 AM] ONI#6888
won?


[04/14/2021 10:47 AM] ONI#6888
this view https://yearn.vision/d/ewqULfBMk/curve-vaults-apy?orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now&refresh=1m shows you relative weights out of all veCRV allocations for each curve pool


[04/14/2021 10:51 AM] Cristobal93#6634
Im trying to get an estimate to when the crvUST pool will harvest, the price per share indicates that it had never been harvested, am i right?


[04/14/2021 10:54 AM] ONI#6888
Looking into it

Hello, trying to withdraw or unstake son USDC but not able to do so. What could I be doing wrong?


[04/14/2021 10:56 AM] ONI#6888
from the usdc v2 or v1 vault?


[04/14/2021 10:56 AM] ONI#6888
what is the error msg? Which wallet are you using? on phone or computer?


[04/14/2021 10:56 AM] shabuyaghi#3323
V1 vault


[04/14/2021 10:56 AM] shabuyaghi#3323
computer


[04/14/2021 10:59 AM] ONI#6888
with metamask?


[04/14/2021 10:59 AM] shabuyaghi#3323
yes


[04/14/2021 10:59 AM] ONI#6888
can you dm me the error msg?


[04/14/2021 10:59 AM] ONI#6888
do you have enough eth in your wallet ?


[04/14/2021 11:00 AM] ONI#6888
you probably need greater than 50$ worth of eth


[04/14/2021 11:07 AM] Cristobal93#6634
Any findings?


[04/14/2021 11:24 AM] ONI#6888
Not yet, best thing to do for now is wait till harvest is called.


[04/14/2021 11:28 AM] Cristobal93#6634
But is there a max amount of time until that? Should i wait a week? A month? Because I have a fairly big investment in the crvUST vault and if it doesnt harvest maybe i should move to another vault and not miss the wins


[04/14/2021 11:29 AM] ONI#6888
It should be soon, vaults harvest at a min. weekly but for now I would wait till I have news 😄 wont be long


[04/14/2021 11:29 AM] Cristobal93#6634
Ok, thanks!

@ONI how often are funds distributed to your balance in yearn v2 vaults? If i move my funds out with a pending amount owed to me (but yet to be dispersed) how does that work?


[04/14/2021 11:37 AM] ONI#6888
when harvest is called share price dips for a bit on v2 vaults, and then it is slowly distributed over 6 hours, to prevent an attack


[04/14/2021 11:37 AM] ONI#6888
you can look to see if share price was called within the last 6 hours on that vault if its v2


[04/14/2021 11:37 AM] ONI#6888
this is prevented in v1 with a withdrawal fee and slippage controls


[04/14/2021 12:52 PM] philfog#6863
Is this why UDT vault is now showing N/A just because there hasn't been a harvest in a while?


[04/14/2021 1:13 PM] ONI#6888
Yes


[04/14/2021 1:13 PM] ONI#6888
Also curve ust v1 vault is working fine it's just harvest hasnt been called yet @Unknown


[04/14/2021 1:55 PM] rubberjesus#6361
Any resolution for this?


[04/14/2021 5:21 PM] soul4sail#7925
I need help w/various Yearn finance issues: I input YFI into a Vault & YFI Vault is inactive & I can't see my balance,using Meta Mask. Also I was attempting last week to input USDC into Earn & got insufficient balance errors & that's not true,also it showed gas amount same as total which wasn't the total I tried to input & gas was %50 of total I wanted to input, all messed up & confusing to me


[04/14/2021 5:22 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
which yfi vault did you deposit to v1 or v2?


[04/14/2021 5:24 PM] soul4sail#7925
hmm,not sure,v1 I think,idk


[04/14/2021 5:24 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
0xBA2E7Fed597fd0E3e70f5130BcDbbFE06bB94fe1


[04/14/2021 5:24 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
this is the v1 vault token


[04/14/2021 5:25 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
try adding it to metamask and see if it shows up


[04/14/2021 5:26 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
when you deposit YFI to the v1 vault you get yYFI tokens in return which reflect your vault shares


[04/14/2021 5:26 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
that is what should be in your wallet


[04/14/2021 5:27 PM] soul4sail#7925
yea,that's what I expected & I don't think I ever got them


[04/14/2021 5:27 PM] soul4sail#7925
I switched the URL to v2, yet it still says V1 in the line of YFI & says it's inactive


[04/14/2021 5:31 PM] soul4sail#7925
Well in my meta mask activity I sent to this yearn address: 0x0bc529c00C6401aEF6D220BE8C6Ea1667F6Ad93e & the Transaction ID on Etherscan is this: 0xac3e5226391785c0d23b6c19803066f9bf048e46483bc423ff3d5d5b9f4289de


[04/14/2021 5:32 PM] soul4sail#7925
Contract 0x0bc529c00c6401aef6d220be8c6ea1667f6ad93e (Ygov.finance: YFI Token)


[04/14/2021 5:32 PM] soul4sail#7925
it shows that in etherscan also


[04/14/2021 5:34 PM] soul4sail#7925
okay,wait,now I see the balance on the v2.yearn.finance page


[04/14/2021 5:37 PM] soul4sail#7925
though I do see the balance in v2 vault now,I still don't have a yYFI token in meta mask


[04/14/2021 5:42 PM] arberx#3367
You have to manually add tokens to metamask

[04/14/2021 5:43 PM] arberx#3367
Look at your address on etherscan

{Reactions}

[04/14/2021 5:43 PM] arberx#3367
If you see the token there you’re good. You can then click on the token, copy the token address and then manually add to metamask


[04/14/2021 5:44 PM] soul4sail#7925
So which address do I add to meta mask to input token into it?


[04/14/2021 5:45 PM] arberx#3367
The yyfi token address


[04/14/2021 5:45 PM] arberx#3367
You should get it from etherscan


[04/14/2021 5:45 PM] soul4sail#7925
the to addr,then,I guess


[04/14/2021 5:46 PM] arberx#3367
Should be this one: 0xba2e7fed597fd0e3e70f5130bcdbbfe06bb94fe1


[04/14/2021 5:47 PM] arberx#3367
Go to your metamask, add the token manually


[04/14/2021 5:47 PM] soul4sail#7925
when I got to add custom token in meta mask & input contract addr it says it's already been added


[04/14/2021 5:47 PM] arberx#3367
Should see it pop up


[04/14/2021 5:47 PM] arberx#3367
Okay then you should see it  in it wallet


[04/14/2021 5:49 PM] soul4sail#7925
yea,I don't see it in meta mask,only see a $0 bal on YFI, I don't see yYFI at all & as mentioned try to add by that contract # I see on etherscan,says already added, that address you sent,I don't see that on my etherscan,what is that?


[04/14/2021 5:50 PM] arberx#3367
That’s the yyfi contract address


[04/14/2021 5:51 PM] arberx#3367
Try adding that, see what happens


[04/14/2021 5:52 PM] soul4sail#7925
& when searching for yYFI in meta mask,why doesn't it find that

{Reactions}
ppdance 

[04/14/2021 6:03 PM] arberx#3367
Yeah, so metamask doesn’t include many tokens by default. You have to manually add them. Easiest way is to go on etherscan, look at your list of tokens, click on them and copy the contract address and add it to metamask


[04/14/2021 6:03 PM] soul4sail#7925
only other yield I had done was Aave so far & screwed that up,accident sent the token to nexo & a year later they still haven't recovered/returned it as they promise they're working on it,ugh,fortunately only a couple hundred,not a huge amount,learn a hard lesson there


[04/14/2021 6:04 PM] arberx#3367

i'm having an issue withdrawing - I initiated withdrawl from crvIB to ETH and got the spend limit transaction approved. Now when I click withdraw nothing happens. How do I complete the withdrawal?


[04/14/2021 7:23 PM] ONI#6888
pro tip its on ape.tax already


[04/14/2021 7:24 PM] ONI#6888
I would try on zapper.fi with higher slippage


[04/14/2021 7:25 PM] ataros#7107
do i need to do multiple transactions for it to withdraw? once confirm the spend limit and second to withdraw? or just one transaction should have worked?


[04/14/2021 7:26 PM] ataros#7107
when i click withdraw nothing happens, no error message or anything


[04/14/2021 7:28 PM] ONI#6888
it should be 2 transactions


[04/14/2021 7:28 PM] ONI#6888
approve spending that token, and the actual zap transaction


[04/14/2021 7:28 PM] ONI#6888
if you already approve it then just 1 transaction


[04/14/2021 7:33 PM] ataros#7107
yeah so any idea why nothing happens on second transaction when I click "Withdraw"?


[04/14/2021 7:34 PM] ataros#7107
ive obv reloaded the page etc


[04/14/2021 7:34 PM] ataros#7107

probably YLA which is an index of vault tokens


[04/14/2021 8:52 PM] ataros#7107
tried that, same issue. I've also now tried at zapper.fi with 3% slippage and get the error "Try reloading the page or logging out then reconnecting your wallet. Reach out to us if this persists. You can also try increasing the slippage."


[04/14/2021 8:53 PM] ataros#7107
any further ideas?


[04/14/2021 8:53 PM] ONI#6888
It's possible the ironbank zap doesn't work right now I can check

thank you


[04/14/2021 8:58 PM] ONI#6888

Hey guys. Just tried sending ETH from my metamask. Says the transaction is completed but ether scan stating “there is a pending txn with a lower account nonce”. Not seeing the balance in any of the wallets. Appreciate the help

if i deposit 1 YFI into the vault today and exit 1 YFI tomorrow, how much would i pay in management fee?


[04/15/2021 3:04 PM] j.#6352
It means you have a transaction in queue that needs to clear/confirm first. You can't submit any further transactions after the current nonce is confirmed or cancelled


[04/15/2021 3:04 PM] j2121#9855
Thank you. It succeeded but the funds are still not in my Coinbase wallet

How come APYs are different between yearn.finance and yearn.vision? I setup the dashboard for a 6 month view of the crvSeth vault and got a 32.8 apy, but in yearn.finance it says 17%


[04/15/2021 3:29 PM] Johnny F#4404
There was an ETH hardfork today and some ETH node implementation are stuck. Possibly your wallet uses one of those (many other services currently have similar problems). All of that is being fixed as we speak, and will be fine again soon.


[04/15/2021 3:29 PM] Johnny F#4404
As a side node: since so much isnt working right now, gas is freaking cheap right now. Now's the time for all the low prio transactions that were too expensive before... 64 gwei is getting mined right now

is it possible to see how much interest i've earned in $ terms across vaults?
also do all vaults compound yield automatically?


[04/15/2021 6:44 PM] arberx#3367
Try: https://trackavault.com/


[04/15/2021 6:44 PM] arberx#3367
Yes vaults compound automatically


[04/15/2021 6:45 PM] arberx#3367
Also: yearn.fi

Is crvUST vault functioning normally? Growth N/A and cannot withdraw funds. Wallet is connected, and balance is correctly displayed.

Attempting to withdraw funds via Zapper.fi is also not working


[04/15/2021 11:04 PM] ONI#6888
yes it is working normally


[04/15/2021 11:04 PM] ONI#6888
you cannot withdrawal from curve ust vault on yearn.finance?

Hi, sorry if this was already answered before; Im trying to put DAI in the v2 DAI vault but seems I have to pay ~1.2 in ETH ; is this expected or is a bug? (the v1 DAI vault only ask for 0.006 ETH)


[04/16/2021 5:38 AM] ONI#6888
your trying to deposit on yearn.finance?


[04/16/2021 5:42 AM] jjardon#8614

[04/16/2021 5:43 AM] ONI#6888
reconnect your wallet and try again


[04/16/2021 5:46 AM] jjardon#8614
@ONI nah, same thing; 1.4 ETH this time


[04/16/2021 6:24 AM] ONI#6888
Can you send me the error msg?


[04/16/2021 6:28 AM] ONI#6888
You could try to revoke the vault's authorization at https://revoke.cash and then reauthorize it at yearn.finance


[04/16/2021 6:33 AM] j.#6352
You can also deposit in yearn vaults through zapper and zerion. Youll see dai v2 on those


[04/16/2021 6:33 AM] ONI#6888
Yah you could try it there too, I am not aware of any problems with the Dai v2 vault. All vaults are working normally.


[04/16/2021 8:41 AM] Apocalyp#3581
I've seen gas bug out when not having enough eth for transactions.  Are you sure you have enough ether jjardin?


[04/16/2021 8:41 AM] ONI#6888
Yah it could be that too make sure you have at least over 100$ worth of eth


[04/16/2021 10:52 AM] jjardon#8614
@ONI ok, I put $500 more eth and now is asking for 3.5 eth 🙂 is it maybe because the amount of DAI is very little (only ~250)


[04/16/2021 11:31 AM] ONI#6888
Odd did you try at zapper?


[04/16/2021 11:31 AM] ONI#6888
You have enough eth for sure now


[04/16/2021 2:43 PM] polygondream#1296
hey guys, I'm trying to get the basics of the tier 1 vaults. particulars of depositing token for y (lp) tokens and how you'd collect yield (source https://docs.yearn.finance/yusd)
also for simplicity sake, leaving out the strategies involved:
so given the vaults DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD
we are given in return their wrapped counter parts for deposits (the yUSD family?)
Q1: Depositing or zapping the accepted tokens would get you the lp tokens in return, yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, TUSD. e.g. DAI -> yDAI
Q2: are these yUSD tokens swapped back (or burned rather) to withdraw the underlying asset with interest?
Q3: is there any advantage for convenience of zapping DAI instead of direct deposit of DAI or is it for the convenience of lesser txs, time and (hopefully) less gas fees?
Also why is yUSD referred to as [yyDAI+...+yTUSD], wouldn't it be [yDAI+...]?


[04/16/2021 2:45 PM] polygondream#1296
and should I be asking this in #🗣general


[04/16/2021 3:02 PM] j.#6352
A2. Withdrawing burns the yTOKEN. In return you get your underlying plus interest.
A3. yUSD is yyDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD because the underlying token is yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD which is the LP token for the Y pool on Curve.fi. The four tokens in that pool are yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, yTUSD.

[04/16/2021 3:02 PM] j.#6352
confusing right


[04/16/2021 3:04 PM] j.#6352
Here's the Curve y pool LP token on etherscan https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf5e0e81dff6faf3a7e52ba697820c5e32d806a8


[04/16/2021 3:24 PM] polygondream#1296
ohhhh i get it now regarding A3. it's just semantics, so yUSD = y(yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD); 
I'm guessing these are also considered derivatives, so I thought yyDAI alone had the double derivative applied out of all the others lol


[04/16/2021 4:39 PM] polygondream#1296
what LP tokens does the yCRV Vault aka curve.fi/y LP mint (that you get in return) on deposit?


[04/16/2021 4:43 PM] arberx#3367
Usually vault tokens append “yv” to the front of the asset name

yUSD is the vault token for yCRV. best to stay on https://yearn.finance and deposit into the yCRV vault if thats what you are looking for

okay I get it now yUSD aka yyDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD is just wrapped tokens of yCRV aka yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD  in curve's Y pool, so depositing in that pool gives you yUSD, which is what you can also do via yCRV Vault which gives you yyCRV = yUSD as j mentioned earlier

You can also just buy it on sushiswap, uniswap, 1inch instead of manually depositing or zapping


[04/17/2021 10:59 AM] Orvar#7695
The website has not updated the deposit amount in crvSAAVE for more than a week and when I look the transactions, it seems that there has been some harvest.  In the past, it used to updated every 3 dyas or so. IS there any reason?


[04/17/2021 11:03 AM] Johnny F#4404
You're correct that it hasnt harvested in a week, oddly (why? I dont know, maybe someone else does).
But your value still goes up: about half to a third of the SAAVE value accrues by increased token value (so when you switch back from SAAVE to any stablecoin, you'll get more coins than you put in). That was still the case the last 7 days: https://yearn.vision/d/6n3HB1hMz2/v1-vaults?viewPanel=18&orgId=1&refresh=5s&from=now-7d&to=now (select SAAVE on the right side)


[04/17/2021 2:35 PM] ambient puppy#5530
can i put less than 0.01 YFI in the yearn vault?


[04/17/2021 2:53 PM] Johnny F#4404
yes, but if you account for gas fees for depositing and later withdrawing, that's not going to be a good idea. At current returns, you'd break even after 1-2 years...


[04/17/2021 3:10 PM] ambient puppy#5530
yfi is gooder than therum

Hello I am trying to use yearn with metamask on an android phone. When I attempt to connect my wallet through the browser it asks me to install metamask, but I already have it installed. Tried on both Firefox and Chrome


[04/17/2021 7:44 PM] Adref#5620
It says that I am connected to the web app via Ledger.

However although I have an ETH balance upon selecting to deposit some ETH the button appears non-responsive; any idea?


[04/17/2021 7:59 PM] Adref#5620
Nevermind, I seem to have worked it out


[04/17/2021 9:58 PM] halloflogos#0867
ah ha


[04/17/2021 9:59 PM] arberx#3367
Got it?


[04/17/2021 9:59 PM] halloflogos#0867
yeah its WETH yVault (yvWETH)


[04/17/2021 9:59 PM] arberx#3367
Nice


[04/17/2021 10:00 PM] arberx#3367
Try withdrawing from zapper, the gas estimates are better


[04/17/2021 10:00 PM] arberx#3367
Metamask doesn't like yearn vaults for some reason


[04/17/2021 10:00 PM] halloflogos#0867
awesome ok, so i go to zapper, I go to pools


[04/17/2021 10:01 PM] halloflogos#0867
ill see WETH, ill click the minus button


[04/17/2021 10:01 PM] Adref#5620
On what schedule is interest/earnings due to depositors accrued? Does the quantity of assets credited to my account update daily, monthly, every 10,000 blocks, every block or what?


[04/17/2021 10:01 PM] arberx#3367
Harvest is dependent on the specific vault


[04/17/2021 10:01 PM] arberx#3367
Some vaults do it everyday


[04/17/2021 10:01 PM] arberx#3367
Others, every week


[04/17/2021 10:02 PM] halloflogos#0867
also where it says earning/fees, its just a "-"


[04/17/2021 10:02 PM] Adref#5620
ok, is there information on what schedule each vault has?


[04/17/2021 10:05 PM] arberx#3367
No it depends, there's a new UI coming out, hopefully that clarifies things


[04/17/2021 10:05 PM] arberx#3367
Agree though, maybe we can make a bot in the discord that messages during a harvest


[04/17/2021 10:06 PM] arberx#3367
On zapper?


[04/17/2021 10:06 PM] halloflogos#0867
yeah 😦


[04/17/2021 10:06 PM] arberx#3367
Zapper doesn't do a good job of estimating yearn earnings correctly, best is trackavault and yearn.fi


[04/17/2021 10:06 PM] arberx#3367
See #🔗links


[04/17/2021 10:06 PM] arberx#3367
New UI soon should clear it up


[04/17/2021 10:07 PM] Adref#5620
Upon a harvest, are earnings automatically withdrawn with capital remaining in the vault, or is all reinvested


[04/17/2021 10:07 PM] arberx#3367
So earnings are harvested added to the vault, and only a certain percentage of assets are deployed in a strategy at one time

https://docs.yearn.finance/


[04/17/2021 10:12 PM] halloflogos#0867
so what do I do now?


[04/17/2021 10:25 PM] polygondream#1296
trackavault is only for yearn vaults?


[04/17/2021 10:25 PM] arberx#3367
What’s the problem lol?


[04/17/2021 10:25 PM] arberx#3367
Not sure, think so


[04/17/2021 10:31 PM] polygondream#1296
any recommendations on finding the underlying ROI on the vaults? or rough estimate/projection


[04/17/2021 10:32 PM] polygondream#1296
zapper lists them out as N/A


[04/17/2021 10:35 PM] polygondream#1296
or I'll just refer to the yearn.finance/vaults page


[04/17/2021 10:54 PM] BlueHorseShoe#9453
having problem with using metamask with yearn.finance.  i tested deposit for drops in gas prices too many times and now hitting deposit doesn't generate a transaction in metamask.  tried reconnecting wallet, deleting cookies.


[04/17/2021 11:02 PM] polygondream#1296
https://duneanalytics.com/projects/yearn
https://yieldfarming.info/yearn/yvault/
these are pretty interesting; the latter shows up to a weekly roi and the current strategy (not a comprehensive list)


[04/17/2021 11:38 PM] BlueHorseShoe#9453
as follow up, I tried deposit on zapper.fi and it gives a fail message if I use 1% slippage.  Increase to 2% slippage then I get the reject/confirm transaction message in metamask that I used to get on yearn.finance.  Since yearn.finance defaults to 1% slippage maybe this is why it no longer works?


[04/17/2021 11:58 PM] s1nthetic#2775

Hi! I asked this in #🗣general but I just deposited DAI into a v2 vault using MetaMask. I haven't received any yDAI for the transaction, but it shows up on the site GUI and the contract executed. Should I be worried about that?


[04/18/2021 12:53 AM] arberx#3367
Metamask doesn’t support most tokens automatically


[04/18/2021 12:53 AM] arberx#3367
look at your address on etherscan


[04/18/2021 12:53 AM] arberx#3367
You should see the ydai


[04/18/2021 12:54 AM] arberx#3367
Copy the address and add it as a custom token in your metamask

[04/18/2021 1:19 AM] ONI#6888
Yes that would make sense, yearn max slippage is set to 1%, so if you get an error message like that use zapper and set the slippage higher, if your comfortable with that.


[04/18/2021 1:36 AM] BlueHorseShoe#9453
I was looking to deposit into the crvUSDP pool.  Isn't another alternative just using deposit and stake at the curve.fi USDP pool?


[04/18/2021 1:36 AM] BlueHorseShoe#9453
or not the same thing?


[04/18/2021 1:36 AM] ONI#6888
nope


[04/18/2021 1:37 AM] ONI#6888
if you want to deposit into the yearn vault you **cannot** stake at curve


[04/18/2021 1:37 AM] ONI#6888
if you stake at curve you will be unable to deposit into our vaults, and you will need to manually sell the CRV you get and manually boost the pools yourself


[04/18/2021 1:38 AM] ONI#6888
just just deposit and don't stake then you will see your tokens ready to deposit at yearn


[04/18/2021 1:40 AM] BlueHorseShoe#9453
interesting.  but is it two transactions?  eth gas is going nuts right now. also same as if I converted USDC to USDP at curve and deposit at yearn?


[04/18/2021 1:41 AM] ONI#6888
if you zap in it will be less transactions, you can do this on our site yearn.finance


[04/18/2021 1:41 AM] ONI#6888
if you do curve deposit then yearn deposit it will be 3 or 4 transactions


[04/18/2021 1:42 AM] ONI#6888
"also same as if I converted USDC to USDP at curve and deposit at yearn?" the zap will do this for you and deposit in one step, so might as well use that its cheaper too overall


[04/18/2021 1:42 AM] ONI#6888
so go to the usdp vault at yearn and deposit with usdc


[04/18/2021 1:44 AM] BlueHorseShoe#9453
deposit for crvUSDP isn't working at yearn.  think it is 1% slippage issue.  if I go to zapper.fi and try to deposit in the yearn crvUSDP pool with 1% slippage I get error message.  Using 2% gets transaction to popup in metamask.  Think zapper knows of the issue but won't be fixed till monday.


[04/18/2021 1:45 AM] BlueHorseShoe#9453
well, just tried it again.  now works with crazy gas prices. almost $600 to deposit.  I can wait.

I deposited my ethereum classic in the yearn finance using trust wallet thinking it would work. But as now told to me . Only ethereum works on yearn finance.  So is there any way to get my etc back?


[04/20/2021 5:08 AM] ONI#6888
Dont think so, no. Sadly if you sent etc to a yearn vault then it is lost


[04/20/2021 5:08 AM] Anakin Skywalker#3023
Oh ok


[04/20/2021 8:55 AM] shinobi#2576
How often is the yield received ? I deposited some in ETH vault


[04/20/2021 9:37 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
yield occurs every harvest() call.  Your balance of vault tokens won't change, but the underlying balance it represents will increase


[04/20/2021 10:57 AM] shinobi#2576
How do I view the progress


[04/20/2021 11:02 AM] HAtTip3675#6478
they are working on UI improvements to better show this, also yearn.vision shows this, but its down as they are fixing it due to berlin upgrade messing up the node

Okay, thank you.


[04/20/2021 6:10 PM] soul4sail#7925
I still cannot figure out why I get insanely high gas & total,which triggers an insufficient funds error (even when I have more than enough to cover it,in Meta Mask),that equal the same amount,when trying to deposit USDC into Yearn.Finance V2, someone,here helped,try to figure it out,but I still get it. I know ETH gas is high,but for it to be over %160 of the amount I'm trying to deposit,there is no way that can be right? Can anyone help me w/this, it's been so aggravating.


[04/20/2021 6:11 PM] soul4sail#7925
My Gas will say the same amount as total too & it's literally like %160 of the amount I want to deposit, makes no sense


[04/20/2021 6:11 PM] arberx#3367
Try going through zapper, metamask isn’t great sometimes

👍 

[04/20/2021 6:11 PM] soul4sail#7925
maybe even more than %160 that's just an example,it's likely higher than that


[04/20/2021 6:12 PM] soul4sail#7925
I've seen that suggestion before, does it then incur other extra fees?


[04/20/2021 6:12 PM] arberx#3367
No


[04/20/2021 6:13 PM] soul4sail#7925
thanks you were the one I was speaking with,I was trying this again today & yea, no matter what it fails w/Meta Mask,so..I got Zapper tab open,I'll have to get familiarized w/it better

if you want to DM me the etherscan link to the tx i can look


[04/20/2021 8:39 PM] Mestre.R2#0724
oh, wait, I just see wETH now...  so I must use the zap to swap to ETH ?


[04/20/2021 8:39 PM] vany#0365
if you received eth i would assume so


[04/20/2021 8:40 PM] Mestre.R2#0724
Yes, the vault was ETH, I was expecting to get ETH directly, so its just one extra step.

I need some help, I'm a little bit in over my head. I put ~$10k into yearn `yveCRV - ETH`, and now I can see `48.67` `yveCRY - ETH` deposited. I also got some pickle LP listed under `Available Pickle LP` under the `yveCRV - ETH`. I deposited that, but I can't see it under `app.pickle.finance/farms` when I connect my wallet there


[04/21/2021 12:27 AM] ONI#6888
I think pickle is moving to a new ui and yvecrv is moving to yvboost soon

okay yeah it's under the old farm - `pSLP yveCRV`


[04/21/2021 12:28 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
so I need to move it to the new farm and pay more transaction fees?


[04/21/2021 12:30 AM] ONI#6888
the new vault/farms are not yet out for yvBoost, which is yveCRV's vault token. A vault which will autocompound yveCRV's rewards weekly for you.


[04/21/2021 12:30 AM] ONI#6888
I would just wait till it's released, then we will have a zap for you to help migrate to the new vault/pools

👍 

[04/21/2021 12:31 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
You can also migrate to the new pickle farms if pickles is something you're into


[04/21/2021 12:31 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
I really need to do more basic research, I kinda dove into this without fully understanding what I was doing, obviously not ideal


[04/21/2021 12:31 AM] ONI#6888
for now I would just wait


[04/21/2021 12:32 AM] ONI#6888
yah generally that isnt a good idea


[04/21/2021 12:32 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
i'm just happy I can see my stuff now, was a little lost


[04/21/2021 12:32 AM] ONI#6888
no worries it would probably show up on zapper.fi too


[04/21/2021 12:33 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
so it's fine to just take no action for now, I guess it's continuing to be staked and earning for now


[04/21/2021 12:34 AM] ONI#6888
its fine, im not fully sure but pickle is migrate stuff to dill so yield might drop when that is finished, but your are fine.


[04/21/2021 12:34 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
The bonus pickles are going to move to the new farms in 2 days, but the sushi rewards will still work autocompounding


[04/21/2021 12:35 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
it looks like there's only about 24 hours before the pickle rewards are dead on the old farms, so I guess I might as well migrate soon


[04/21/2021 12:35 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
But the GAS .............


[04/21/2021 12:35 AM] ONI#6888
well not really


[04/21/2021 12:35 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Still too hawt atm


[04/21/2021 12:36 AM] ONI#6888
the yvecrv-eth sushi pool will be deprecated for the yboost-eth pool when the new vault launches


[04/21/2021 12:36 AM] ONI#6888
so switching will waste gas and not get you much


[04/21/2021 12:36 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
so the `yveCRV - ETH` asset on yearn.finance reports 52,xx% growth, how much of that is tied to the pickle rewards?


[04/21/2021 12:37 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
vs sushi


[04/21/2021 12:37 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
like my understanding level is that basically there are these two sets of reward tokens contributing to the asset growth


[04/21/2021 12:38 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Its the difference between the jar apy and the farm apy on pickle.finance

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/21/2021 12:38 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
The jar is around 50 and the farm ads single digit apy


[04/21/2021 12:43 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
where are the sushi rewards represented in `yveCRV-ETH` asset on yearn?


[04/21/2021 12:44 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
They get sold for more yveCRV and ETH


[04/21/2021 12:45 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
So the amount of pSLP you have stays the same but represents more SLP


[04/21/2021 12:46 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
I see - so ultimately it's all in pickle. The underlying value of the pickle assets is what actually goes up in the end of the chain?


[04/21/2021 12:46 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
for the sushi rewards at least


[04/21/2021 12:47 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Yeah


[04/21/2021 12:48 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
ok so I should wait for the zap to yvBoost


[04/21/2021 12:48 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
I think that's the takeaway here


[04/21/2021 12:50 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
For only 10k, the most important thing is not spending gas that eats into returns imo


[04/21/2021 12:50 AM] bakkerthehacker#1350
Its always free to wait


[04/21/2021 12:58 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
yeah


[04/21/2021 12:59 AM] unus elephantidae#2128
the pickle rewards farming is going down in 24h but most of the reward is sushi

[04/21/2021 11:01 AM] wiwiwiwi#5333
hi i need some help with depositing into the crvSTETH pool. I have been trying to deposit into the pool for the past week, but not successful. The "add liquidity" step was shown to be successful in my metamask, and the quantity shows up in the "Available" area on yearn.finance in crvSTETH, however, I tried "Deposit" three times, and each time, it is just hung. The transactions have been shown as "queued" for 1-7 days. Even my cancelation attempt on one of the three transactions didn't go through, it is shown as pending. Could someone tell me what is going on? Thanks a lot!


[04/21/2021 11:05 AM] j.#6352
how many transactions do you currently have pending or in queue?


[04/21/2021 11:06 AM] j.#6352
succeeding txs cant be confirmed before the first one gets confirmed


[04/21/2021 12:03 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
i have three transactions, all for deposit. Two were queued, one was queued than I attempted to cancel then the cancelation was pending


[04/21/2021 12:04 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
ah! so should I cancel the first one?


[04/21/2021 12:05 PM] j.#6352
To save on gas you'd spend on cancelling the first tx. Send the same deposit tx, if you still want to deposit, but edit the none to be the same as the stuck transaction you wanted to cancel


[04/21/2021 12:06 PM] j.#6352
This way, you wont have to do two txs, one for cancelling, one for another deposit. Instead, you'll be doing one deposit


[04/21/2021 12:07 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
thank you, but I don't understand it very well. How do I "edit the non to be the same as the stuck transaction"?


[04/21/2021 12:18 PM] j.#6352
Are you using metamask? You should see the nonce of a transaction when you click on it


[04/21/2021 12:34 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
@j. Thank you! Now I see the nonce, but still couldn't figure out the status of my trades. My add_liquidity operations was successful with a nonce=10. Then the deposit with nonce=11 failed. I subsequently tried to cancel it, but it was shown as pending. Later I made two more attempts to deposit with nonce=12 and nonce=13, but they were blocked by the transaction with nonce=11 whose cancelation is hung....


[04/21/2021 12:35 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
I've made another attempt to cancel transaction with nonce=11, but everything is shown as pending....


[04/21/2021 12:35 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
sorry for my very messy operation, I am new to this and learning as we talk....


[04/21/2021 12:48 PM] j.#6352
What are the ones that are currently pending?


[04/21/2021 12:48 PM] j.#6352
11, 12, 13?


[04/21/2021 12:49 PM] j.#6352
you must send a tx with 11 nonce with higher gas. always monitor gas prices before sending a tx. see gasnow.org


[04/21/2021 12:52 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
yes, 11, 12, 13 are pending. Got it. Trying to figure out how to a tx with 11 nonce with higher gas....


[04/21/2021 12:53 PM] rfc#1962
is the yearn.finance/stats site not working? I try to see my earnings but nothing is showing
i see my deposits on yearn.finance


[04/21/2021 12:53 PM] j.#6352
In metamask before clicking *confirm* you'll see a box where nonce can be entered. You may have to enable this in settings>advanced


[04/21/2021 2:36 PM] wiwiwiwi#5333
I was able to get the deposit transaction through. Thank you so much!

is the 20% fee in v2 vaults on yearn-only profit or on all profit? (If I'm in SAAVE, am I paying for the underlying pool profit, or just the CRV tokens harvested?)


[04/21/2021 10:39 PM] vany#0365
just what yearn farms


[04/21/2021 10:40 PM] vany#0365
so if you are depositing the pool tokens, and gains the pool tokens get would not be subject to yearn fees

Why are yearn vault withdrawals $150 right now? The deposit was a lot cheaper since there's no curve logic depositing happening and I figured the deposit/withdrawal would be similar in price


[04/21/2021 11:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will the price go down if I wait? (Because from my understanding deposits/withdrawals are done in batches)

hello, I am trying to zap out from crvUSDP vault but looks like i can only get the native asset. When I try to to choose another asset it doesnt even connect to Metamask. Tried with Zapper and i could only authorize it to spend my yvusdp3CRV but then i could not "confirm" the swap (will report this to Zapper team).


[04/22/2021 8:17 AM] ONI#6888

You can migrate to v2 but I would suggest doing it when gas is cheap. We try to post all vault migrations to #📣announcements and our telegram updates channel https://t.me/yearnupdates

Just have some questions regarding 1-click, I cannot see the drop down list of tokens can anyone help?


[04/22/2021 2:16 PM] Alex | OD#0395
hi everyone, 

I am trying to understand the fees of the USDC Vault, 17% currently. 
I see 2% Management and 20% performance.
This means that if I put for example 1000 USD, 2% are taken on it as deposit fee (20 USD) and from the remaining part, I get 80% of 17% APY. 

This means that I will need 2 month more or less to to recover the 20 USD that were taken from the management fee.

Do I understand correctly ?


[04/22/2021 2:19 PM] arberx#3367
No the 17% is what you get. The fees are accounted for in the net apy calculation


[04/22/2021 3:15 PM] Alex | OD#0395
but there is something taken if I deposit ?


[04/22/2021 3:16 PM] Alex | OD#0395
which means that, (without considering network gas), I have to pay 2% of my capital to enter the Vault ?


[04/22/2021 3:16 PM] Johnny F#4404
No. It's taken continuously over the year, so that 2% are deducted from the total balance over this 1 year


[04/22/2021 3:16 PM] Alex | OD#0395
but it is 2% of what ?


[04/22/2021 3:16 PM] Johnny F#4404
Of your whole balance


[04/22/2021 3:16 PM] Alex | OD#0395
initial deposit ?


[04/22/2021 3:16 PM] Johnny F#4404
whole balance at the time


[04/22/2021 3:16 PM] Alex | OD#0395
if I stay 2years


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Alex | OD#0395
they will take 2% again next year ?


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Johnny F#4404
if you stay 2 years, you've paid 2% each year, so around 4% total, possibly some more if the balance increases during the time


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Johnny F#4404
yes


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Alex | OD#0395
and if I enter / exit today


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Johnny F#4404
so if you deposit now and withdraw again in 5 minutes, you'll have not paid anything but the gas costs


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Alex | OD#0395
(just to understand)


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Alex | OD#0395
Will I get the same capital ?


[04/22/2021 3:17 PM] Alex | OD#0395
or my capital - 2%


[04/22/2021 3:18 PM] Johnny F#4404
yes, minus gas costs


[04/22/2021 3:18 PM] Alex | OD#0395
ofc


[04/22/2021 3:18 PM] Alex | OD#0395
ok. 
So.... basicly my capital can just grow


[04/22/2021 3:18 PM] Johnny F#4404
correct


[04/22/2021 3:18 PM] Alex | OD#0395
even if they take a fee, I can not get less than what I put (putting aside the gas cost)


[04/22/2021 3:19 PM] Johnny F#4404
yes.


[04/22/2021 3:19 PM] Alex | OD#0395
One more question regarding rewards


[04/22/2021 3:20 PM] Alex | OD#0395
if I am in the Vault USDC, rewards are  in USDC right ?

I assume they are compounded to get the 17 % APY. 
What would be the APR if I cashout all rewards on a monthly basis for example.


[04/22/2021 3:21 PM] Johnny F#4404
All rewards are USDC in the USDC vault. All vaults increase the balance of what is inside them (only exception is the odd one, yveCRV vault, there you get paid in stablecoins).
APR / APY conversion: no idea what the APY calculation assumption are, someone else will know. My guess is that it probably would be 14% APR or so


[04/22/2021 5:43 PM] thomasku11#3486
Is "Growth" % on yearn.finance just APY?

Hi. What is the withdrawal estimated fee for v1 vault?  Currently it is showing .33 eth for deposit it took 0.07 eth at 125 gwei


[04/23/2021 12:44 AM] arberx#3367
Gas is really high rn as the market is volatile


[04/23/2021 12:45 AM] bandla7#6840
Still if i do transaction at 120gwei i will be paying 0.15 which is double than intial deposit.


[04/23/2021 12:48 AM] arberx#3367
Yeah that’s the market unfortunately. You can wait, try zapper (sometimes metamask gives higher gas estimates on yearn) or set a gas limit and hope it gets mined


[04/23/2021 12:50 AM] bandla7#6840
Thanks Appreciate it.


[04/23/2021 6:20 AM] xixixixis#5944
Hi ! How is it possible that it costs me 860$ to withdraw 2300$, even with 80gwei ? At this price, my funds will be locked forever 😅

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[04/23/2021 11:14 AM] Alex | OD#0395
Regarding the yveCRV - ETH  Vault,

The APY presented is 51%.
Does this APY includes PICQULE Rewards that must be stacked manually ?

If I deposit ETH, when I withdraw, will I get ETH ? or ETH + CRV (50/50) ?


[04/23/2021 12:57 PM] ｗｉｌｌ#5116
zaps into vaults are currently failing.  looks like the problem starst with a 500 error at the zapper.fi API:

I connected my Metamask and tried to deposit into USDC v2 vault.  I approved 2 transactions and actually received a confirmation that my transaction went through.


[04/23/2021 1:13 PM] ichorid#4333
but my wallet still shows the USDC in my wallet and on yearn.finance it still shows the same USDC available to deposit.


[04/23/2021 1:13 PM] arberx#3367
So there’s two transactions


[04/23/2021 1:13 PM] arberx#3367
One to approve yearn to spend, the other to actually deposit


[04/23/2021 1:14 PM] arberx#3367
You sure you didn’t simply do an approval?


[04/23/2021 1:15 PM] ichorid#4333
in my metamask activity log it has 2 entries: 1) Approve USDC spend limit.  and 2) Withdraw


[04/23/2021 1:15 PM] ichorid#4333
both with yearn.finance.


[04/23/2021 1:15 PM] ichorid#4333
and both transactions are confirmed.


[04/23/2021 1:17 PM] ichorid#4333
those are the 2 transactions that I need to go through right?


[04/23/2021 1:18 PM] arberx#3367
Withdraw? You said you’re depositing right?


[04/23/2021 1:19 PM] ichorid#4333
i want to deposit, but my Metamask log says Withdraw.  I assume that means "Withdrawing from my metamask wallet in order to deposit into yearn vault"


[04/23/2021 1:20 PM] arberx#3367
If you don’t mind sharing the transactions, I can take a look. (You can send them privately through a DM if you want)

if you use eth it will trade your eth for crv and then lock the crv for yvecrv, which gets you weekly 3crv rewards but you initial funds are always locked

if I deposit into yveCRV-ETH, do I still get to claim rewards as one would with the yveCRV or I give up claiming those rewards [directly] as it's staked in yveCRV-ETH SLP


[04/24/2021 2:27 PM] polygondream#1296
Nvm, got it  - How can I earn extra Sushi rewards?
You can provide yveCrv/ETH liquidity on Sushiswap to earn extra rewards. Note that if you earn Sushi rewards you will not be able to claim the 3Pool rewards as well. By providing yveCRV-WETH liquidity to Sushiswap, you may be exposed to impermanent loss.

[04/24/2021 8:07 PM] Entbeard.HiFi#1372
Also on the yearn vault page it doesn't display how much ETH I deposited...


[04/24/2021 8:30 PM] Entbeard.HiFi#1372
When I hit approve and stake on pickle finance it just sits on "Approving"


[04/25/2021 2:11 AM] ONI#6888

im testing the tx fee for withdrawing from the usdp pool; currently the standard gas price is 39 according to ETH gas station. I'm getting an estimate of $90@ 39 Gwei.  When I see the withdraw txs on etherscan fees were at $27@51 Gwei $35@66 Gwei etc; why is that?


[04/25/2021 10:15 AM] arberx#3367
Withdrawing from a vault, and sending a simple transaction take up different amount of gas


[04/25/2021 10:16 AM] arberx#3367
In this case, 3x as much.


[04/25/2021 10:16 AM] arberx#3367
Sometimes zapper gives better/cheaper estimates


[04/25/2021 10:16 AM] polygondream#1296
I'm doing it directly from curve fi front end/web site


[04/25/2021 10:17 AM] polygondream#1296
Guessing it's cause im dealing only with estimates then not the actual


[04/25/2021 10:20 AM] polygondream#1296
would choosing 'withdraw & claim' require 2 txs that's not factored in the initial tx fee estimate?


[04/25/2021 10:21 AM] polygondream#1296
assuming I have infinite approval


[04/25/2021 10:21 AM] arberx#3367
No, the transaction is more complex. The estimate could also be off


[04/25/2021 10:21 AM] arberx#3367

it quotes you how much it would use if it used all the gas upto the gas limit, but the transactions doesnt always use up to the gas limit

[04/25/2021 10:33 AM] polygondream#1296
for a pool with a high/low balance of a given coin, what factors change when adjusting the slippage (e.g. fees or duration, failure rate, etc)? I get that I'll be compensated with a bonus for low balances (on a deposit) or high balances on a withdrawal and their inverses are also true


[04/25/2021 10:56 AM] polygondream#1296
after unstaking a desired number of pool token, is it more efficient to withdraw & claim for just one pool, or withdraw from one pool and choosing claim all?


[04/25/2021 1:53 PM] PUCK#2284
Where can one find the vault holdings and strategy holdings for a given vault for purposes of finding out if  a V1 vault withdrawal will be subject to the 0.5% withdrawal fee?


[04/25/2021 1:57 PM] ONI#6888
are you talking about using curve pools?


[04/25/2021 1:58 PM] ONI#6888
depends on what you do with the coins after, the most efficient with 0 slippage is withdrawal all. But if your just going to swap them later for say eth or a single stablecoin best to withdrawal to one stablecoin when withdrawing from the curve pool

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/25/2021 1:58 PM] ONI#6888
hover over the version number on yearn.finance and it will tell you the fees


[04/25/2021 2:28 PM] PUCK#2284
I guess I need to clarify.  To withdraw from a V1 vault, there is a 0.5% fee at time of withdrawal if the amount withdrawn is greater than the amount if idle holdings (which is the same as vault holdings minus strategy holdings).  The documents say that if the withdrawal is less than the idle holdings, then there is no 0.5% fee.  I assume that is still the case, but how does one find out the amount of idle holdings in a given vault.


[04/25/2021 2:29 PM] PUCK#2284
Although hovering says some have 0.5% fee and some have 0% fee, wouldn't it depend on the amount of the withdrawal?


[04/25/2021 3:03 PM] vany#0365
You can check the vault contract and see how much idle funds there are. Also we are upgrading vaults to v2 so the ones actively moving from v1 to v2 have withdraw fees turned off


[04/25/2021 3:28 PM] PUCK#2284
For a techno-phobe, how would one see the amount of idle funds?  I can find the vault contract address on etherscan, but then what?


[04/25/2021 4:03 PM] vany#0365
Under the token balance if there are funds in there you will see them. If the amount you want to withdraw is less than that number you would avoid the withdraw fee


[04/25/2021 5:16 PM] Rocco#7581
Am I right in thinking https://trackavault.com/ does not support v2 vaults? If so, when will they be supported and trackable?

HI folks, new to Yearn and want to start using the vaults. I'm still a bit confused with all the different UI screens. I put money into a DAI vault with Zapper.fi. Now i understand that i have a fixed number of yvDAI in my wallet. Now i want to see how much interest i have earned as I plan to just withdraw the interest. Does the portfolio balance on yearn.fi and yearn.finance continually update with the current value of the investment in DAI?  If i withdraw the interest only should withdraw a portion of my yvDAI until the portfolio value is equal to the original amount of DAI invested?


[04/25/2021 9:41 PM] arberx#3367

or maybe there's a dex where you can sell yla into eth directly? - just be careful that the price makes sense with slippage etc


[04/26/2021 4:01 AM] ONI#6888
For now best to withdraw from the index

thank you, I swap ftm from ETH to FTM , then the ftm is sent out, but I can't receive them on FTM.

could someone remove the emoji on #📣announcements? as I just discovered that following that channel so it re-posts in your own server appears to be broken when a emjoi is present...

I was wondering why only like 2/10 crypto servers I'm following were ever posting to my own server channel and now I think I know why 😛


[04/26/2021 11:24 AM] vany#0365
just did a test on my server and it appears to be working just fine with emojis. my guess is the servers you follow don't click the "publish" button so its in the channel but not sent across other servers


[04/26/2021 11:25 AM] BinarySword#2012
well that's annoying,
all I have are crypto.com announcements for like the last 1+ months haha


[04/26/2021 11:26 AM] BinarySword#2012
seems none of the Defi servers like yourself, Aave, Alpha, 1inc, Uniswap, etc have bothered to publish I guess


[04/26/2021 11:26 AM] BinarySword#2012
or maybe it is due to a lot of the announcements being through a robot reposting announcements from say Twitter?


[04/26/2021 11:31 AM] vany#0365
im guessing it would still publish if it was clicked. i can start making sure we publish our posts.

Hi, when I hit Connect Wallet on the Yearn vault page it just automatically connects to my wallet, but on my Trust Wallet when I go to Wallet Connect it just gives me the screen to scan the QR code.

How often are the harvest / compound on this kind of vault ?

Which wallet are you using? Try Zapper. Some UI problems can sometimes be worked around by using Zapper or Zerion

But Zapper has had some issues with zapping recently. not sure for which vaults

Used same walllet with usdc before without issues but will follow your advice... metamask ok?

[04/28/2021 10:24 AM] divousn#1076
I haven't use yearn till now, so I have some beginner question. 

When you deposit crvSTETH, is APY on yearn including base APY on curve or only rewards APY?


[04/28/2021 10:30 AM] j.#6352
Base as in  fees? It's both


[04/28/2021 10:30 AM] j.#6352
ah wait no. the rewards


[04/28/2021 10:31 AM] j.#6352
but the value of crvSTETH increases with the fees APY


[04/28/2021 10:32 AM] j.#6352
so yearn's apy is on the crvSTETH token increase/yield


[04/28/2021 10:36 AM] vany#0365
If you hover over the % it provides details on how the APY is calculated. It includes everything

Hi, i am working on a python app to track my portfolio and showing its historical performance. I have some YFI in the v2 vault with the address 0xE14d13d8B3b85aF791b2AADD661cDBd5E6097Db1. I could not find historical prices for the vault token YFI yVault (yvYFI). Is there an endpoint I can use to fetch the token price or my historical earnings in the vault?


[04/28/2021 12:51 PM] kx9x#3778
Yearn.fi does this by batch calling pricePerShare and balanceOf for the user on the vault at different historical block numbers

https://github.com/antonnell/yearn-finance/blob/68070acdc2076b89019cafb93e7d4aac748dc96e/stores/investStore.jsx#L611


[04/28/2021 12:52 PM] kx9x#3778
No endpoint currently, so you have to calc this all manually


[04/28/2021 12:55 PM] kx9x#3778
and here is how yearn.fi generates their graph: https://github.com/antonnell/yearn-finance/blob/68070acdc2076b89019cafb93e7d4aac748dc96e/components/vaultPerformanceGraph/vaultPerformanceGraph.js#L124


[04/28/2021 12:55 PM] kx9x#3778
unfortunately not in python, so you will have to adapt if you want to use a similar pattern

[04/29/2021 11:49 AM] ONI#6888
Ledger X, but both ledger and trezor are fine


[04/29/2021 11:53 AM] Cristobal93#6634
And I would have to transfer my yearn tokens (for exmaple in my metamask wallet now i have X amount of yvlinkCRV) directly to my new address of the hardware wallet? or i would have to go back to LINK and make the deposit againt?


[04/29/2021 11:53 AM] ONI#6888
no you can send vault tokens like any other erc-20 token

True, you could use a PO box to receive it, but their hardware is still good


[04/29/2021 11:57 AM] kx9x#3778
so make sure you spend at least some time doing your due diligence of considering all the different options


[04/29/2021 11:57 AM] kx9x#3778
I am happy with Trezor, in fact, if I had ordered Ledger at the time, my address would have been leaked


[04/29/2021 11:57 AM] kx9x#3778
so I got lucky


[04/29/2021 11:58 AM] kx9x#3778
and this was the second leak, so I had the first leak in mind when I ordered, iirc


[04/29/2021 11:58 AM] kx9x#3778
I saw some other weird hardware wallets with QR codes or like little cards


[04/29/2021 11:58 AM] kx9x#3778
seems like the market is expanding


[04/29/2021 11:59 AM] kx9x#3778
but I just wanted to stick with a well-known product for my first hardware wallet. Kept it simple


[04/29/2021 11:59 AM] kx9x#3778
My first Trezor broke after one day of use though.... so always make a backup


[04/29/2021 12:00 PM] kx9x#3778
they sent me a replacement, but it still kinda sucked since I had to spend a bunch of gas sending all my coins back to my other wallet after restoring my backup


[04/29/2021 12:01 PM] Cristobal93#6634
ok, thanks, ill keep that in mind


[04/29/2021 12:02 PM] Cristobal93#6634
and buying via amazon is too risky?


[04/29/2021 12:05 PM] arberx#3367
No you’ll be fine. But if you don’t want to support Amazon just buy directly from the manufacturer


[04/29/2021 12:09 PM] Cristobal93#6634
Yeah, but i'm from Chile, so regular shipping is expensive and can be retained on customs and also takes for ever, and Amazon purchases takes care of all of that and usally get to my house in about a week or two

[04/29/2021 12:13 PM] kx9x#3778
Just do firmware checks and make sure you are running signed firmware from Trezor or whoever else


[04/29/2021 12:13 PM] kx9x#3778
and make sure the hardware hasn't been tampered with


[04/29/2021 12:14 PM] ONI#6888
no amazon is fine -- just NEVER use a seed someone gives you, generate one and write it down safely NEVER store it on a computer or take a picture of it


[04/29/2021 12:15 PM] Cristobal93#6634
ok, thanks!


[04/29/2021 12:15 PM] ONI#6888
on both ledger and trezor you generate your own seed.
If it as one on a paper then they are trying to scam you with that seed phrase. Generate your own


[04/29/2021 12:21 PM] kx9x#3778
yes, take ONI's advice


[04/29/2021 12:22 PM] kx9x#3778
I'd say read all of Trezor and Ledger's docs


[04/29/2021 12:22 PM] kx9x#3778
really try to understand what a hardware wallet is


[04/29/2021 12:22 PM] kx9x#3778
and what a seed is


[04/29/2021 12:22 PM] kx9x#3778
understand what it takes for someone to steal your funds and what it takes to secure yours


[04/29/2021 12:23 PM] kx9x#3778
consider it an investment in your financial security and just make sure you know what you are doing. Write down your plan for how you will go about restoring a backup, consider emergency scenarios, etc


[04/29/2021 12:23 PM] kx9x#3778
Also, stick to standards. Do NOT use a brain wallet. Do NOT try to implement your own weird algorithm for generating a seed.

Hello, I am trying to understand something please.
I have recently invested TUSD into yearn via the Crypto.com Defi Wallet. I also have ETH in my wallet, enough for gas fees. For whatever reason, the app refuses to let me withdraw so I am starting to look into other options and that is how I ended up here. 

When I connect to v2.yearn.finance, 
- I see my ETH available to deposit and nothing in the vault as expected.
- In the TUSD section, I see nothing available to deposit and nothing in the vault.

When I connect to v1.year.finance/earn,
- I see I have no TUSD in the balance and I can see my yTUSD above the Claim button. 

So I though, great, I am going to claim them back. But when I do, there is a bit of graphic activity at the top of the page and I waited a couple of minutes but nothing ended up happening.

Could anyone direct me towards the right page or forum or section where I could understand what I should be doing? Or if you have the answer, please do not hesitate. 
Thank you


[04/29/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
use yearn.finance and check you balances


[04/29/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
not v2.yearn.finance


[04/29/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
tusd has a very high gas fee to withdrawal from usually


[04/29/2021 1:23 PM] Aym#3642
Thank you for jumping in ONI, I have checked yearn.finance and I get the same information than with v2.yearn.finance. Still nothing in the TUSD section to withdraw from. I currently have 0.2 ETH available so I would have thought that was enough.


[04/29/2021 1:23 PM] ONI#6888
you might not be in a vault but are in earn


[04/29/2021 1:23 PM] ONI#6888
check here https://v1.yearn.finance/earn


[04/29/2021 1:24 PM] ONI#6888
check v2 and v3 for tusd


[04/29/2021 1:25 PM] Aym#3642
Yes, indeed, I am in the v2. I can see the yTUSD there. But nothing happens when I claim them


[04/29/2021 1:25 PM] ONI#6888
so your in earn hum


[04/29/2021 1:26 PM] ONI#6888
Is this through wallet connect or?


[04/29/2021 1:26 PM] Aym#3642
yes


[04/29/2021 1:26 PM] ONI#6888
it doesnt do anything when you hit withdrawal?


[04/29/2021 1:27 PM] Aym#3642
There is no withdrawal option, but a claim one. When I put 100% and then click claim. There is a rolling graphic at the top of the page starting but nothing seems to happen. How long is this supposed to go on for?


[04/29/2021 1:28 PM] ONI#6888
are you connected on the computer or on mobile?


[04/29/2021 1:28 PM] Aym#3642
computer


[04/29/2021 1:28 PM] ONI#6888
do you see it on zapper.fi?


[04/29/2021 1:28 PM] ONI#6888
can you connect your account and see if it shows tusd earn pool


[04/29/2021 1:28 PM] Aym#3642
I will try


[04/29/2021 1:31 PM] Aym#3642
When I connect to zapper.fi, I see the wallet with what matches the ETH, the deposits with what matches the yTUSD
Below, I see platforms with yearn matching my yTUSD


[04/29/2021 1:32 PM] Aym#3642
So it's all there


[04/29/2021 1:32 PM] ONI#6888
click the minus button to withdrawal


[04/29/2021 1:32 PM] ONI#6888
go to pool tab and see if you still see it


[04/29/2021 1:35 PM] Aym#3642
I am looking for the minus button. I seem stupid enough not to find it


[04/29/2021 1:37 PM] ONI#6888
it might not be there sadly


[04/29/2021 1:37 PM] ONI#6888
can you go back to v1.yearn.finance/earn


[04/29/2021 1:37 PM] ONI#6888
hit cntl+shift+r


[04/29/2021 1:38 PM] ONI#6888
clear your cookies, readd your wallet


[04/29/2021 1:38 PM] ONI#6888
and try to withdrawal again


[04/29/2021 1:39 PM] Aym#3642
I will do that. How long should the withdrawal reasonably take do you think?


[04/29/2021 1:39 PM] ONI#6888
depends on what gas you use


[04/29/2021 1:39 PM] Aym#3642
I will make sure to leave the page open accordingly


[04/29/2021 1:39 PM] ONI#6888
use gasnow.org for estimating gas


[04/29/2021 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
if you pay for fast it should take less than a minute


[04/29/2021 1:43 PM] Aym#3642
yes, ok, but it is because I do not see any speed choice on v1.yearn.finance/earn so I was not sure what the default was


[04/29/2021 1:43 PM] ONI#6888
it should be when you confirm the trx on your wallet


[04/29/2021 1:44 PM] ONI#6888
you should be able to change the gas with an gas or advanced option


[04/29/2021 1:44 PM] Aym#3642
I guess it hasn't let me reach that part yet


[04/29/2021 1:44 PM] ONI#6888
when you are sending the transaction


[04/29/2021 1:44 PM] ONI#6888
yearn doesnt show you gas


[04/29/2021 1:45 PM] Aym#3642
I am in the y.curve.fi tab again, I can see my yTUSD, I will try claiming 100% again


[04/29/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
try claiming less than 100%


[04/29/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
manually type it in but a tad less than 100%


[04/29/2021 1:49 PM] Aym#3642
I will let the blue graphic roll at the top for some time, see if something happens


[04/29/2021 1:51 PM] ONI#6888
I will ask the team


[04/29/2021 1:52 PM] Aym#3642
It just rolls at the top. I will try with 25% only


[04/29/2021 1:57 PM] Aym#3642
Same thing, it just rolls until the wallet disconnects


[04/29/2021 1:57 PM] ONI#6888
I will let you know when I hear something


[04/29/2021 1:57 PM] Aym#3642
Thank you


[04/29/2021 1:58 PM] Collin#6699
Hello, I tried to make my first deposit to a Yearn Vault and made the initial transaction to set up my account. It has been pending for 120 minutes now. Is that normal? I'm thinking gas fees jumped up right before I clicked okay?


[04/29/2021 1:58 PM] ONI#6888
yes its normal, but you can speed it up


[04/29/2021 1:58 PM] ONI#6888
are you on metamask


[04/29/2021 1:59 PM] Collin#6699
yes


[04/29/2021 1:59 PM] ONI#6888
go to your pending trx and hit speed up


[04/29/2021 1:59 PM] ONI#6888
use gasnow.org to see what gas to set


[04/29/2021 1:59 PM] ONI#6888
its on the activity page


[04/29/2021 1:59 PM] ONI#6888
click the trx and there is a speed up option


[04/29/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
probably need to use like 128 gwei


[04/29/2021 2:00 PM] Collin#6699
ah I see


[04/29/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
when the trx comes up again go to advanced and set it to 110-128


[04/29/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
you can see estimates on gasnow.org


[04/29/2021 2:01 PM] Collin#6699
so if I'm not in a rush, I could leave it alone for a day or two, and if it's still not complete up the gas?


[04/29/2021 2:01 PM] ONI#6888
sure


[04/29/2021 2:01 PM] ONI#6888
that will save you money


[04/29/2021 2:01 PM] Collin#6699
cool. I'm just dabbling with a small sum now to see how everything works


[04/29/2021 2:01 PM] ONI#6888
but to deposit into vaults requires two transactions


[04/29/2021 2:01 PM] Collin#6699
thanks for the quick feedback! Much appreciated


[04/29/2021 2:02 PM] ONI#6888
an approve to spend tokens, and a deposit


[04/29/2021 2:02 PM] ONI#6888
you might have just done number one


[04/29/2021 2:02 PM] Collin#6699
ah I did. I figured you wait until that is processed, then deposit into the vault for additional gas


[04/29/2021 2:02 PM] ONI#6888
you did the first one? or are on the second one?


[04/29/2021 2:02 PM] Collin#6699
which I know is high right now, so my initial deposit won't make financial sense. But just want to make sure I understand how it all works


[04/29/2021 2:03 PM] Collin#6699
the first one. initial deposit


[04/29/2021 2:03 PM] Collin#6699
'approve to spend tokens' is what I'm stuck on


[04/29/2021 2:03 PM] ONI#6888
that is the first one


[04/29/2021 2:03 PM] ONI#6888
so after it goes through you need to actually deposit


[04/29/2021 2:04 PM] Collin#6699
correct. And I assume that's where I'll get hit with the high gas fees. But that's okay for now. Come on ETH2 🙂


[04/29/2021 2:04 PM] ONI#6888
yah, haha


[04/29/2021 2:04 PM] ONI#6888
hopefully it will be here soon


[04/29/2021 2:05 PM] Collin#6699
thanks for the help ONI. I have a couple friends interested in Yearn as well so I'll forward along the info


[04/29/2021 2:05 PM] ONI#6888
sure thing


[04/29/2021 2:59 PM] Collin#6699
hello again. So my 'approve to spend tokens' transaction has now been approved. But, when I try to make my deposit, metamask pops up with a gas fee but the deposit amount is $0.00, not the amount I entered in the vault text box. Any ideas?


[04/29/2021 3:06 PM] arberx#3367
Are you using trezor?


[04/29/2021 3:06 PM] Collin#6699
metamask. I'm afraid I waited too long to make the deposit and it wants me to do the 'approve to spend tokens' transaction again?


[04/29/2021 3:07 PM] arberx#3367
Are you using just metamask or a hardware wallet connected through metamask?


[04/29/2021 3:07 PM] Collin#6699
just metamask


[04/29/2021 3:07 PM] arberx#3367
Because there have been issues with that before


[04/29/2021 3:07 PM] arberx#3367
Okay, you don’t have to approve the transaction twice


[04/29/2021 3:07 PM] arberx#3367
Just once


[04/29/2021 3:07 PM] arberx#3367
Retry the deposit


[04/29/2021 3:07 PM] arberx#3367
Manually set the deposit limit


[04/29/2021 3:09 PM] Collin#6699
yeah I tried manually typing in numbers below the 'max' and it still says the deposit is $0.00


[04/29/2021 3:12 PM] Collin#6699
it wouldn't be due to using the Brave Browser, would it?


[04/29/2021 3:19 PM] arberx#3367
No idea tbh, you can also try using zapper.fi


[04/29/2021 3:19 PM] arberx#3367
If the main site it’s working for you


[04/29/2021 3:29 PM] Collin#6699
so I'm in zaffer.fi. Connected my metamask, looked up the USDC yearn vault, and now I can just deposit the USDC into the vault and it works just the same as the yearn.finance interface worked? Any pros/cons to going the zapper.fi route?

{Reactions}
peepoyes 

[04/29/2021 3:35 PM] arberx#3367
it’s the same


[04/29/2021 3:35 PM] arberx#3367
Frontends for dapps are for simply for UX purposes. You can interact directly with the contacts if you want


[04/29/2021 3:42 PM] Collin#6699
Well shoot, I had to make the same 'approve to spend tokens' initial transaction again with zapper.fi, and after that I got the same issue where metamask claims I'm sending $0.00 worth of USDC. I think it's just not meant to be


[04/29/2021 4:51 PM] arberx#3367
Weird you sure you have usdc?


[04/29/2021 4:51 PM] arberx#3367
That’s really weird

hi, im trying to withdraw from the crvGUSD pool, but I can't zap out into another token? any idea how to fix this?
I choose ETH and click withdraw, but nothing happens


[04/30/2021 11:09 AM] zazka#8072
Hello. Quick question here: do you know where I can buy cover for the crvEURS vault? I only see DAI on https://yearn.finance/cover/0xF75138950ADE728757F0bD058D7Ec8D8F43cf450. Or should I just buy a DAI cover worth of my EURS position?

Basically:
- I understand the interface at https://yinsure.finance/add
- But I DON'T understand the interface at https://yearn.finance/cover/0xF75138950ADE728757F0bD058D7Ec8D8F43cf450 (the system displays "$NaN Value of cover" for whatever DAI amount I enter).

Are they both the same??


[04/30/2021 11:55 AM] rjdiprose#6453
Hi- I read that I can zap say ETH into any vault by using the drop down on the vault. However when I go into the USDC v2 vault, the only drop down is USDC. I have my wallet connected, is the reason I’m not seeing any other asset on the drop down because I don’t have say ETH in my wallet at the moment?


[04/30/2021 11:57 AM] rjdiprose#6453
And also what is the minimum I can transfer to a vault to make sure it goes through first before moving a normal amount


[04/30/2021 12:12 PM] jcazzato#0808
Hello - I'm trying to migrate SLP from yveCRV-ETH LP into yvBOOST-ETH LP, when i approve it says the gas fees are like $1900 is that a mistake

hey all, new to yearn and testing out the yvBoost-ETH zap tool - i've zapped some ETH into pSLP and then deposited it into the vault - where do i see my balance/yield now? I would have thought it would be on pickle.finance?

[04/30/2021 1:32 PM] ibhi#7928
I can, but I did not sign the transaction, as the gas fees was too high


[04/30/2021 2:04 PM] Jeralt#7779
I'm facing the same issue. Gas is like 1 ETH to approve


[04/30/2021 2:15 PM] Dakeyras#1337
Hello, does someone know where to find support for multichain.xyz please ?


[04/30/2021 2:24 PM] Tommer#1137
Hi all, I understand that withdrawal fees related to migration are waived for sBTC vault v1 -> v2. Does this only apply to migration, or also full withdrawal? I'm thinking of moving to oBTC vault as it gives better returns, and wonder if migrating to sBTC v2 first and then withdrawing and investing in oBTC is cheaper, although it's one more transaction with gas fees. The amount I want to move is larger than what's in the sBTC v1 buffer (vault minus strategy). Thank you!


[04/30/2021 2:48 PM] Jeralt#7779
Do we know if at least manually reducing the gas limit to something reasonable makes the migration work?


[04/30/2021 3:52 PM] QuietSpecialist#0001
same problem... high gas... let me know if @saltyfacu  able to help u


[04/30/2021 3:54 PM] rfc#1962
when I try to approve my SLP on yveCRV-ETH it gives me a 0.7 Ether Gas Fee and it trows an exception in the contract code showing in MM

[04/30/2021 8:45 PM] Adref#5620
"yvBOOST - ETH v2" has two underlyings right? So if I deposit ETH into it, the token that the APY represents is in eth?


[04/30/2021 8:48 PM] Adref#5620
Or should I just deposit into the Eth v2 vault if I want to earn ETH


[04/30/2021 9:00 PM] vany#0365
no its represented in the LP position. so 50/50 yvboost/eth. there is possible IL just like any AMM LP


[04/30/2021 9:04 PM] Adref#5620
Should the transaction cost ~0.02 ETH?


[04/30/2021 9:05 PM] Adref#5620
Seems a little high,


[04/30/2021 9:10 PM] Adref#5620
I think I will just put it in the eth vault


[04/30/2021 10:14 PM] Tommer#1137
please can anyone tell me: are withdrawal fees waived not just for migrating from v1 to v2 but also withdrawing?


[04/30/2021 10:14 PM] arberx#3367
v2 vaults have no withdrawal fees


[04/30/2021 10:15 PM] Tommer#1137
Thanks, but what about v1 vaults? Should I migrate first and than withdraw from v2 to save fees? It would be one more tx


[04/30/2021 10:16 PM] arberx#3367
Unless there's a v2 equivalent, there are still withdrawal fees


[04/30/2021 10:16 PM] arberx#3367
No withdrawal fees if you're allowed to migrate


[04/30/2021 10:18 PM] Tommer#1137
ok, that's great to hear! The tweets were a bit unclear, so "Withdrawal fees related to the migration are waived" includes the withdrawal option, not just migration option


[04/30/2021 10:20 PM] arberx#3367
Hmm, let me double check


[04/30/2021 10:23 PM] Tommer#1137
Thanks, much appreciated! I don't want to be surprised after having 0.5% less after withdrawing.


[04/30/2021 11:45 PM] arberx#3367
There's still a withdraw fee, only vaults that are inactive or have a migration available don't have a withdrawal fee


[04/30/2021 11:49 PM] Tommer#1137
sBTC v1 has migration available. So the withdrawal fee would be waived, correct?


[04/30/2021 11:50 PM] arberx#3367
If you migrate***


[04/30/2021 11:50 PM] arberx#3367
to v2


[04/30/2021 11:50 PM] arberx#3367
Only if you migrate


[04/30/2021 11:51 PM] Tommer#1137
I see, thank you for clarifying - in that case it will be cheaper for me to migrate and then withdraw. Cheers!


[04/30/2021 11:54 PM] arberx#3367
Really depends, gas is somewhat cheap so I imagine so...


[04/30/2021 11:55 PM] arberx#3367
Okay scratch that


[04/30/2021 11:55 PM] arberx#3367
Withdrawal fees are disabled for vaults with migration


[04/30/2021 11:56 PM] arberx#3367
So just withdraw!


[04/30/2021 11:56 PM] Tommer#1137
ok! 🙂

How is the "growth" column of a vault calculated?


[05/01/2021 2:27 AM] vany#0365
if you hover over we give a breakdown. its basically vault APY minus fees


[05/01/2021 2:48 AM] lance#1956
Hello! New here, I'm trying to decide whether or not to use the yUSDC Vault or yUSDC Earn product to park a large amount of USDC. The Earn dashboard still has a "this project is in beta" warning but, from my understanding, the yUSDC Earn product is probably the safer option but has a lower rate of return than the yUSDC vault (fine with a low risk, low return solution). Also what fees are associated with the Earn products?


[05/01/2021 2:51 AM] vany#0365
Earn finds the best place to loan your USDC only, no fees. the vault has additional strats to earn more and you can see the fees by hovering over "v2" next to USDC vault. the Grow % is what you would get after fees


[05/01/2021 4:54 AM] saltyfacu#1111
share it with me. Even if you didn't sign. I'd like to check

[05/01/2021 10:06 AM] j.#6352
that looks about right


[05/01/2021 10:30 AM] Adref#5620
It's based on the trailing 4 harvests, right? Assuming that's the case from the hover text for those displaying "New" instead of a value


[05/01/2021 10:31 AM] Adref#5620
So if harvests are daily, presumably the value can be fairly volatile


[05/01/2021 10:39 AM] vany#0365
curve vaults are calculate based on curve provided apr's, other vaults are calculated based on prior harvests correct


[05/01/2021 12:35 PM] Jeralt#7779
Thanks


[05/01/2021 3:36 PM] afriend#3265
Is Zapper stuck? My transaction from eth to yveCRV is still pending after 5.5 hours.


[05/01/2021 3:46 PM] arberx#3367
Probably has a very low gas limit


[05/01/2021 3:47 PM] afriend#3265
I didn't change the gas limit, just went with the default. First time I used the zap. Hopefully it completes soon.


[05/01/2021 4:45 PM] arberx#3367
etherscan should give you an estimate if you look at the transaction


[05/01/2021 4:46 PM] arberx#3367
What was the gas set?


[05/01/2021 4:48 PM] jonathan3364#7610
Hey, how to follow my vault on yearn?


[05/01/2021 4:48 PM] afriend#3265
says max transaction cost is $18.28 and 26 gwei.


[05/01/2021 4:48 PM] arberx#3367
yearn.fi or trackavault, new UI soon


[05/01/2021 4:49 PM] arberx#3367
Yep, it's very low, current gas prices are around 40 GWEI


[05/01/2021 4:49 PM] arberx#3367
So either wait, or cancel and redeposit


[05/01/2021 4:49 PM] arberx#3367
It'll probably be mined tonight


[05/01/2021 4:49 PM] afriend#3265
When I did the transaction that was the price, been low for awhile.


[05/01/2021 4:49 PM] arberx#3367
Could have shot up right before you made it


[05/01/2021 4:50 PM] arberx#3367
Happens


[05/01/2021 4:50 PM] arberx#3367
But if you're depositing, it's not a problem


[05/01/2021 4:50 PM] arberx#3367
Personally I would just wait


[05/01/2021 4:50 PM] afriend#3265
I can wait, not a big deal. Just haven't had one take this long before. I was gonna deposit after I received the yveCRV.


[05/01/2021 4:50 PM] arberx#3367
But if you want piece of mind, you can cancel and resubmit


[05/01/2021 5:48 PM] angelfish#8253
anyone use hardware wallets with yearn? curious which one supports


[05/01/2021 6:09 PM] arberx#3367
Supports ledger and trezor, but if you’re using trezor don’t use it with metamask


[05/01/2021 6:09 PM] arberx#3367

Is the stats on CMC accurate for YFI? I had thought that the circulating supply of it was 30k


[05/01/2021 10:45 PM] arberx#3367
Was changed, vote to mint 6666 YFI was passed in February


[05/01/2021 10:45 PM] arberx#3367
Most went to treasury, other as a dev fund


[05/01/2021 10:49 PM] Adref#5620
I see


[05/01/2021 10:57 PM] Adref#5620
Ownership of YFI doesn't grant any kind of dividend from the treasury right (although presumably this can change in the future)? It just represents voting power for the moment?


[05/01/2021 10:58 PM] arberx#3367
Yes was voted on using the fees for buybacks

Is there some lockup period for portions of a deposit? Clicking the Max button does not select everything and manually entering the full amount says I can't withdraw it.
Also how do you know how much interest you have earned so far?

(Just deposited but looking to see how this all works)

[05/03/2021 12:18 PM] mrfonts.eth#6508
Bit of a rookie question… I deposited into a crvusdn pool , I have seen the value of my deposit grow some over a few weeks. However when I look at the corresponding value of the yvcrvusdn y have, the value in $ is significantly lower than the original investment… does this have anything to do w usdn price? (I thought it was pegged to usd) or maybe it’s soemthing to do w this particular vault locking 50% of the assets for boosting yield?


[05/03/2021 12:20 PM] mrfonts.eth#6508
(When I say value kept growing I meant the crvusdn amount i owned in the vault kept growing)


[05/03/2021 12:22 PM] ONI#6888
did you check it on trackavault.com


[05/03/2021 12:23 PM] ONI#6888
what do you mean the value of yvcrvUSDN?


[05/03/2021 12:23 PM] mrfonts.eth#6508
When zapper shows me a price for the yvcrvusdn tokens I own , that’s what I mean by value


[05/03/2021 12:23 PM] ONI#6888
the amount of vault tokens you have wont change unless your deposit more or transfer more in, but your yeild in shown in their price appriciation


[05/03/2021 12:23 PM] ONI#6888
zapper might not be 100% accurate


[05/03/2021 12:24 PM] ONI#6888
yes it could be that usdn is not super stable at 1$


[05/03/2021 12:25 PM] mrfonts.eth#6508
I will check trackvault.com … for context the value I’m currently seeing on zapper is approx 30% lower than what I deposited originally … so it doesn’t seem like a freshness of data issue on zappers side?


[05/03/2021 12:25 PM] ONI#6888
Yah that is wrong


[05/03/2021 12:26 PM] ONI#6888
the vaults are all working normally and making yield based on the apy's you see on yearn.finance


[05/03/2021 12:26 PM] mrfonts.eth#6508
That’s what I figured… I’ll keep looking. Thank you for the help!


[05/03/2021 12:27 PM] mrfonts.eth#6508
Is it reasonable to expect some small fluxtuations because usdn and usd don’t track perfectly, but those variations are small right?


[05/03/2021 12:40 PM] bit#6418
@ONI can you clarify why some vaults take so long to allocated funds to strategies to earn yield? ywbtc there's 65% being unused - is this normal?


[05/03/2021 12:43 PM] ONI#6888
yes


[05/03/2021 12:44 PM] ONI#6888
yes because it has alot of captial that currently cant be optimally allocated to the pools


[05/03/2021 12:44 PM] ONI#6888
if captial isn't fully allocated it is because the head strategists dont want it to be for some reason


[05/03/2021 2:03 PM] bit#6418
does yfi provide updates on things like this? like what is being considered and when the funds might be allocated?


[05/03/2021 2:13 PM] ONI#6888
Generally not really but I can look into the wbtc vault and get back with you


[05/03/2021 2:54 PM] saltyfacu#1111
pickle changed from masterchef to gauge-like contract, do you still have the issue?


[05/03/2021 2:58 PM] bit#6418
I appreciate it. there's a bit of confusion from depositors with the lower than promised apy. I think badger has give an approx. 2 week timeline for the apy to catch up to displayed apys. but would help to get any more details directectly from yfi.


[05/03/2021 3:00 PM] saltyfacu#1111
No, because it's evaluated all the time. There are numerous variables evaluated to make that decission. There a lot of math and scenario testing involved. Believe me when I say that Strategists are doing the best to provide the best yield.


[05/03/2021 3:00 PM] Rocco#7581
is coming up with a yearn v2 vault strategy enough to be a strategist (do you get strategist fees like that) or is the full implementation+testing+auditing required as well?


[05/03/2021 3:00 PM] saltyfacu#1111
For example, in some cases, deploying too much capital into a strat would crush the yield


[05/03/2021 3:01 PM] saltyfacu#1111
The whole package is needed. Auditing is done by Yearn if necessary


[05/03/2021 3:10 PM] Tsardoz#4587
Exactly the same issue. Shows 0 funds in jars but shows up on pickle/info/profit. Trading on Yearn UI resulted in exactly the same outcome and cost me another USD44.

I wanted to migrate it to the v2 yvBOOST-ETH LP but, when I UNSTAKE my LP using MetaMask, it uses up gas, but it never unstakes them.  I have tried several times and it doesn't work. I am on the Yearn.fi site.  Anyone know what is going on? @alphast0rm ?   It is going to require a few steps, and it looks to me that it will be expensive to migrate.  Any suggestions or can I just leave it in the V1 vault?


[05/03/2021 3:35 PM] kx9x#3778
@haredog I think there is a bug with the UI


[05/03/2021 3:36 PM] kx9x#3778
like the UI shows you have some tokens to unstake


[05/03/2021 3:36 PM] haredog#6727
I have the exact same issue


[05/03/2021 3:36 PM] kx9x#3778
but for some reason when you press unstake, it tells the contract to unstake 0


[05/03/2021 3:36 PM] kx9x#3778
it is using the right pool and everything, but I think yearn.finance might have a UI bug where the balance in the input box isn't getting forwarded correctly


[05/03/2021 3:37 PM] haredog#6727
Yes, that is exactly what happens to me.


[05/03/2021 3:37 PM] Tsardoz#4587
There are several others with the same issue. We are sorting it out now


[05/03/2021 3:38 PM] Tsardoz#4587
It looks like it needs to be sorted from pickle side


[05/03/2021 3:39 PM] haredog#6727
Good deal @Unknown  and @kx9x, thanks for the assist.  Do you have any idea how expensive it is going to be to migrate?  a transaction started but was aborted (thank gawd) and it was going to cost something like .5 ETH?    I was kinda hoping Yearn would help with the costs, or at least minimize it for us?


[05/03/2021 3:40 PM] Tsardoz#4587
No. There are 2 options. Migrate directly or unstake. I dont want to do the wrong one. Facu is looking into it


[05/03/2021 3:41 PM] haredog#6727
Well, I have mine in the pickle farm, but when I did the 'unstake' it somehow affected that.  I am unsure what it did exactly.  This is the transaction hash : https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8e0fcde7eaf4d5c9362fea938660b3f03d8fd1a82a58f5be2ee4cc02e2dafbb6


[05/03/2021 3:43 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, for that TX

6.200667866430381905 LP tokens


[05/03/2021 3:45 PM] kx9x#3778
so you could totally go to etherscan directly and call withdraw with _pid = 26 and _amount = 6200667866430381905

but one of the devs found a repro and is pushing a fix soon


[05/03/2021 3:45 PM] kx9x#3778
so you can also wait for that


[05/03/2021 3:54 PM] haredog#6727
@kx9x Thanks, I guess I will wait.  Any clue how long it might take?  I am not in a huge hurry.  I am worried a bit about the transaction fees to migrate though.


[05/03/2021 3:59 PM] kx9x#3778
the fix was merged, not sure how long it will take to deploy the fix


[05/03/2021 3:59 PM] kx9x#3778
@Unknown can probably give an estimate


[05/03/2021 4:51 PM] HongyDUDE#4999
How do i check if the funds which I've deposited in Yearn is earning the APY as advertised on the dashboard?

[05/03/2021 4:57 PM] Tsardoz#4587
Don't do it yet. I just tried and lost transaction fees again.

Hey there, I have a friend who is in alink vault v1


[05/03/2021 6:11 PM] TorJado#3802
has this vault stopped harvesting? and if so, is v2 active?


[05/03/2021 6:12 PM] vany#0365
best to withdraw. but there is no alink v2. we do have the crvLINK vault


[05/03/2021 6:12 PM] vany#0365
no fees on the alink vault currently


[05/03/2021 6:15 PM] TorJado#3802
thanks


[05/03/2021 6:23 PM] Tsardoz#4587
working now. I may have been impatient earlier. Stage 2 fees are high though.


[05/04/2021 6:24 AM] Rocco#7581
If a yearn v2 vault has e.g. 2 strategies, do both strategists get half of the strategist fees regardless of which strategy is being used?


[05/04/2021 7:04 AM] Tsardoz#4587
How do I determine what the value of 1unit  yvBOOST-ETH pair is?


[05/04/2021 8:18 AM] Tsardoz#4587
I did a transfer of 54 yvBOOST into yvBOOST-ETH but the yvBOOST-ETH balance did not change. Yes I did the manual pickle transfer. What happened to these funds?


[05/04/2021 8:43 AM] vany#0365
Did you look at the transaction on etherscan? What did it say it did?


[05/04/2021 8:55 AM] Tsardoz#4587
I am not sure how to interpret these ...

Based on that screenshot the zap did what it was suppose to. Sol half you yvboost for eth and deposited the sushi position into pickle. You should see the slp balance on the pickle “jar” page

Maybe I should be asking on pickle


[05/04/2021 9:18 AM] Tsardoz#4587
The 54 yvBoost did not make any impact


[05/04/2021 9:18 AM] vany#0365
Yeah might be best as the tx shows the deposit into pickle


[05/04/2021 9:19 AM] Tsardoz#4587
What was the USD value of the trade?


[05/04/2021 9:20 AM] Tsardoz#4587
It was only 0.024 eth worth yeah?


[05/04/2021 9:21 AM] vany#0365
Not an even split. It depends specifically on each strategy’s profit.


[05/04/2021 9:22 AM] vany#0365
~$160 it looks like


[05/04/2021 9:22 AM] Rocco#7581
thank you! What determines which strategy is used?

OK so it was just a terrible trade. I was confused thought it was much larger.


[05/04/2021 9:24 AM] vany#0365
Yeah fees would eat into that


[05/04/2021 10:54 AM] Rossco#1438
Hello - is there a preferred token to use to deposit into the V2 Boost?  I tried with IHF but the fees were $170 - is that normal or is there a cheaper way to do it?  Thanks


[05/04/2021 12:30 PM] Dkd#2030
Hi, new here, apologies if this question is super dumb: so I supplied funds into the crvSUSD vault and it shows that I deposited. What happens, next? Do I wait for the yveCURVE rewards to start growing? Many tutorials make it sound like I get it right away.


[05/04/2021 12:34 PM] Dkd#2030
Also, there was this moment where after I supplied to the crvSUSD vault, it then said I didn't have enough eth for the gas fee. But when I clicked out, it seemed to have resolved myself. Did anything bug out? Thanks in advance.


[05/04/2021 12:42 PM] j.#6352

what's the best way to monitor gains? I deposited into crvEURS v1 vault last week. So hard to unravel for me.


[05/04/2021 6:14 PM] vany#0365
@Unknown hey so if its coinbase wallet, you should see on etherscan you received the vault token. you should also see the deposit balance on yearn.finance


[05/04/2021 6:15 PM] formyboys#1793
I don’t see the deposit balance on my yearn.finance


[05/04/2021 6:15 PM] vany#0365
can you dm me the etherscan tx?


[05/04/2021 7:18 PM] tantilis#2930
Same issue here.  Paid the gas fees a few times now and i think the only progress so far is the amount i had in the vault is now also available for deposit but not for converting to the next step.

try it on yearn.finance


[05/05/2021 1:57 AM] ONI#6888
if that doesnt work it is because slippage is higher than 1% so you need to zap on zapper.fi and up the slippage % (if your ok with that)


[05/05/2021 1:58 AM] Jones Tromboneses#0305
im doing only a small amount to test, so if the slippage is higher than 1% already then a larger transaction would be huge slippage


[05/05/2021 2:00 AM] kx9x#3778

the saave zap should work fine for aDAI humm


[05/05/2021 2:03 AM] ONI#6888
make sure to try on yearn.finance


[05/05/2021 2:03 AM] ONI#6888
yearn.fi is not maintained by the yearn team


[05/05/2021 2:07 AM] Jones Tromboneses#0305
yearn.finance always quotes me gas costs of around $1,500 USD. So i stayed away from it. But also how do you deposit aDAI on yearn.finance? my only options are ETH and other tokens.

[05/05/2021 10:55 AM] 1000ways#0913
I have a completely noob question; hope this is the right place. I tried depositing DAI into DAI yvault and the initial transaction had low gas so I added more gas (twice) and it finally went through. However it’s still showing the original transaction as pending and the DAI hasn’t been withdrawn. Did I screw things up by adding more gas?  I’m using MetaMask to transact.

[05/05/2021 11:09 PM] pleasureismine#1410
is it possible to send the vault token to a contract address, if the contract address is a gnosis Safe?


[05/06/2021 3:08 AM] ONI#6888
I would file an issue on their github page https://github.com/antonnell/yearn-finance


[05/06/2021 3:08 AM] ONI#6888
but the eth and weth vaults should be the same since one deposits into the other


[05/06/2021 3:09 AM] ONI#6888
Yes you can send vault tokens like any other erc20 token. If that contract address can hold and manipulate them, you can send it. I am not 100% sure how safe works but I know it can use erc20 tokens (ours holds many vault tokens) but not sure if depositing them is as simple as just sending to that address.

No its yearly on funds deployed to strategies earning yield


[05/06/2021 3:41 AM] CHRJake The Cowboy#4289
so its applied over profits earned by the strategy


[05/06/2021 3:42 AM] CHRJake The Cowboy#4289
and how is it yearly


[05/06/2021 3:42 AM] CHRJake The Cowboy#4289
like its paid every time a harvest happens?

Yes I think that is the case


[05/06/2021 3:43 AM] ONI#6888
calculate per block / year. Then pay it per blocks on harvest. Something like that

[05/06/2021 5:14 AM] ONI#6888
did you stake it in curve gauge?


[05/06/2021 5:15 AM] ONI#6888
you cannot have it staked at curve because you need to deposit it at yearn. So when adding to a pool make sure to deposit and *do not* stake


[05/06/2021 5:19 AM] alexm#8545
thank you. it cost me another 100+ usd(


[05/06/2021 5:21 AM] ONI#6888
sorry about that. Best to send transactions on eth when gas is low. You can check at gasnow.org


[05/06/2021 6:14 AM] Pingu#7389
Hey, bit new so apologies in advance, but have tried looking around first etc.
So, I put a little bit into yvBOOST-ETH earlier, but not sure I fully understand what I should be doing with the vault (thought I did)

The transaction gave me pSLP tokens, which reading the notes it says to manually stakke on pickle finance, which I also did in the back scratcher pSLP yvBOOST farm.

So, I feel like I did everything I am meant to for now, but am at a loss as to figure out what anything is worth if I pulled everything out now? That isn't the intention, but seeing values is nice and helpful...

The harvest (or harvest and exit) buttons on pickle finance, what do these do? There is no "earnt" balance on that farm, so does harvest generate that?

And where does the profit actually come from? Does it come from just the pickle farm staked tokens, or is that in addition to the yvBOOST-ETH pool? And how would I track that?

Thanks.


[05/06/2021 7:32 AM] ONI#6888
did you check zapper.fi?


[05/06/2021 7:33 AM] ONI#6888
harvest claims your pickle rewards.


[05/06/2021 7:33 AM] ONI#6888
harvest and exit claims your pickle rewards and withdraws you from the farm


[05/06/2021 8:20 AM] Pingu#7389
@ONI I hadn't, but have just had a look now. I can see from there the pickle rewards waiting to be claimed now.

Still a little confused though - will anything be earnt directly from the yvBOOST-ETH vault itself? and how do I track / gain any insight on that?
Or is that a vector for swapping to pSLP which is then used in the pickle farm?
Can't see anything on zapper fi on my wallet regarding the yvBOOST-ETH vault, if I was meant to?


[05/06/2021 8:22 AM] ONI#6888
So yvBoost claims your rewards each week and compounds them, thus each week when rewards comes out shareprice of the yvBoost vaut will increase, making the vault token worth more.


[05/06/2021 8:23 AM] ONI#6888
for yvBoost-ETH pool you get a LP token from sushi and pool swap fees accure to the pool increasing its value over time, this is not much maybe a few % apy. The majority of rewards for LPing on sushiswap come from SUSHI token rewards.


[05/06/2021 8:24 AM] ONI#6888
You get sushi rewards by staking your Sushiswap LP token with sushi. If you stake with Sushiswap they will give you sushi that you have to claim manually.


[05/06/2021 8:26 AM] ONI#6888
Alternatively, you can stake that Sushiswap LP token with pickle and they will auto-compound your sushi rewards. If you stake with them they take a % of the sushi rewards for themselves and give you more in PICKLE which you can manually claim at anytime. Also now with pickle you can boost your rewards by locking up PICKLE for DILL. The longer you lock PICKLE up (up to 4 years) the more boost you will get on their FARMs


[05/06/2021 8:28 AM] ONI#6888
Let me know if any of that is confusing. The pickle dill is a copy of the crv vecrv model


[05/06/2021 8:38 AM] Pingu#7389
Thanks for the write up.
So, I put in a small amount (Wanted to get used to things, make sure I knew what I was doing etc) and got back some pSLP. That was the only token I got when depositing into it. To withdraw from the vault, it requires my pSLP, and what you are saying is that the rate between pSLP and how much of the deposited asset that is worth, changes each week? Is there any way of knowing what the current conversion would be if thats true?


[05/06/2021 9:32 AM] ONI#6888
I am not sure if sushi has good metrics on this info, but it would be best to ask them. Also make sure you are staked in the farm on pickle for the best apy.


[05/06/2021 11:36 AM] yuri_nakamoto#6753
I have CRV token, is there any UI to swap from CRV to yvBoost?


[05/06/2021 11:37 AM] yuri_nakamoto#6753
in fact my CRV token is vesting in curve DAO. I recieve from early airdrop.


[05/06/2021 11:37 AM] ONI#6888
if you staked your CRV in curve then it is locked up as veCRV and you cannot transfer it


[05/06/2021 11:38 AM] ONI#6888
if you have CRV and not veCRV you can zap it into the yvBoost vault on yearn.finance/vaults


[05/06/2021 11:40 AM] yuri_nakamoto#6753
also is there any stat on how much 3CRV yearn have earned each week on yvrCRV vault?


[05/06/2021 11:41 AM] ONI#6888
just this

Hi I was about to migrate my yveCRV-ETH LP into yvBOOST-ETH LP on the vaults page. Just wanted to confirm how much migration should cost in fees. For migrating 3yveCRV-ETH LP into yvBOOST-ETH LP im seeing a .113 eth gas fee in my metamask......seems really high

[05/06/2021 5:00 PM] BuyMoreNFTs#5262
and another question - do i need to claim my pickle before migrating or is that built into the process


[05/06/2021 5:01 PM] vany#0365
gas is very expensive currently and your screenshot does not give the details needed, could you show the gas price and gas amount page?


[05/06/2021 5:01 PM] vany#0365
and yes pickle will be claimed when you withdraw

[05/06/2021 5:18 PM] vany#0365
seems a bit high on the gas limit, i used about 800k gas in total but i did it manually, so the zap shouldn't be too different, either way id suggest to wait to do anything til gas is back into the 30-40 gwei range


[05/06/2021 5:18 PM] vany#0365
in that price rage it will still be $150-175 to do all the steps

[05/06/2021 8:04 PM] Piotr#7417
Hi, I’m having issues with staking crvSTETH on yearn (depositing to vault - not sure if that’s the same as staking 😂). After I approve spending, the transaction appear as pending or queued in metamask but when i navigate from metamask to the transaction details on etherscan the page says the the transaction doesn’t exist. Any ideas?


[05/06/2021 8:16 PM] arberx#3367
Just wait


[05/06/2021 8:16 PM] arberx#3367
It’ll show up in a bit, usually takes a minute


[05/06/2021 8:56 PM] Piotr#7417
I’ve tried 4 times over the period of last 2 days. Still, all 4 transactions behave as I described earlier


[05/06/2021 10:52 PM] CoffeeFi#6504
Hi all. I'm trying to withdraw from crvEURS. If I understand, there should be two interactions with the wallet, right? The first went through, but the second never showed up. So now it's in a state where I still have a Vault balance, but unable to Withdraw. There are no pending transactions.


[05/06/2021 11:12 PM] CoffeeFi#6504
It finally went through. Just had to wait 90 minutes I guess...


[05/06/2021 11:12 PM] ONI#6888
make sure your pricing your gas correctly


[05/06/2021 11:12 PM] ONI#6888
use gasnow.org


[05/06/2021 11:15 PM] CoffeeFi#6504
I wasn't clear. There are two transactions to withdraw. The first went through right away. Then nothing. I could not do the second. It didn't start automatically and the Withdraw button did nothing. 90 minutes later, I could use the withdraw button again.


[05/06/2021 11:28 PM] ONI#6888
thats odd on yearn.finance?


[05/06/2021 11:28 PM] CoffeeFi#6504
Yes.

So, it worked because I withdrew mistakenly as crvEURS. I meant to withdraw as Eth. So what can I do with crvEURS?


[05/06/2021 11:29 PM] ONI#6888
you can see if zapper will let you zap it to eth, or just unwind it manually via curve


[05/06/2021 11:31 PM] CoffeeFi#6504
crvEurs does not show up as an option. How do I unwind manually? Using curve.fi?


[05/06/2021 11:32 PM] ONI#6888
it should show you in the crv pool on zapper.fi

[05/06/2021 11:35 PM] CoffeeFi#6504
It's giving me an error message on zapper.fi to reload the page or log out and reconnect the wallet. This is probably the same issue yearn.finance was having. I think I'll just try again tomorrow.


[05/06/2021 11:40 PM] ONI#6888
ok you might have to increase slippage as well


[05/07/2021 12:53 AM] CoffeeFi#6504
I put slippage at 5%. Same error. Recklessly, I set it to 10%. Same result.


[05/07/2021 12:54 AM] ONI#6888
can you dm me the error msg and I can fwd it to the team


[05/07/2021 12:56 AM] bit#6418
wbtc vault now at 78% funds NOT allocated. any update?


[05/07/2021 12:56 AM] ONI#6888
None yet, strategists are working on it, just not alot of places to put wBTC for yield and not have slippage/tank the apy of the farm. But this is a problem actively being worked on.


[05/07/2021 3:27 AM] bit#6418
does badger have any involvement in assisting with the strategies? They've given depositors on badger a timeline of 2 weeks for apys to reach full efficiency as the apys have severely underperformed from what they had promised. but if there's no solution currently to the strat, I'm wondering how accurate a 2 week estimate can really be.


[05/07/2021 3:31 AM] ONI#6888
I didn't say there was no solution, I said it is being worked on by the strategists.


[05/07/2021 3:47 AM] bit#6418
So you agree with the timeline of 2 weeks to sort out the issue?


[05/07/2021 4:24 AM] ONI#6888
I never said that either, it will be done whenever the strategists solve the problems I mentioned above.

I used year.finance to put some ETH in yvBoost-ETH V2 for the first time... 

The transaction was done.. Confirmed many times but I don't see the value back in deposited colomn... So... Where did it go?


[05/08/2021 1:15 PM] FluffyNL#5346
Do I need to configure the token first in metamask? (I did that, but there was still 0)

Hi all! I'm new to yearn and I have a beginner question... I put ETH into a yvault and I would like to get it back to my metamask wallet. When I hit the max and then withdraw, the metamask popup shows the gas cost, however it shows that I am trying to withdraw $0.00 worth of ETH... I'm confused. I tried withdrawing in zapper.fi as well and it just errors out. Any ideas...


[05/09/2021 6:18 AM] ONI#6888
the withdrawal button at yearn.finance works fine it will show 0 ETH because that is how much eth your sending


[05/09/2021 6:19 AM] ONI#6888
but you will get your eth on withdrawal


[05/09/2021 12:12 PM] sammiorelli#0540
Wondering when yearn plans to act on the $EPS airdrop. It's coming up on 2 months and basically no action but instead a new CRV vault released


[05/09/2021 1:05 PM] usn5530#5530
I'm trying to send over 7 eth. Its shows in the box when I hit max. I've also tried typing in a number less than that for fees like 5 eth and it still shows zero in metamask.


[05/09/2021 2:05 PM] usn5530#5530
It says insufficient funds so I cannot click the confirm button on metamask. Do I need eth already in my wallet to withdraw??


[05/09/2021 2:05 PM] ONI#6888
yes you need eth for gas to do anything on the eth network


[05/09/2021 2:06 PM] usn5530#5530

do you think it has to settle or will it be fine as long as MetaMask shows it's received?


[05/09/2021 2:19 PM] ONI#6888
metamask will show it


[05/09/2021 2:20 PM] usn5530#5530
So i'll try it now with 1 eth. I imagine that should be enough


[05/09/2021 2:20 PM] ONI#6888
yah that will be enough


[05/09/2021 2:21 PM] usn5530#5530
hmm it's went through but metamask gave an error that says transaction underpriced


[05/09/2021 2:21 PM] usn5530#5530
It's still pending. So I guess I'll wait


[05/09/2021 2:24 PM] ONI#6888
I would use gasnow.org for gas prices


[05/09/2021 2:24 PM] ONI#6888
yah you can speed it up via metamask as well if you want


[05/09/2021 2:25 PM] usn5530#5530
wait gas now says the fee for fast is like 6 bucks...I'm confused. Im paying 600.


[05/09/2021 2:25 PM] ONI#6888
no


[05/09/2021 2:25 PM] ONI#6888
that is an error


[05/09/2021 2:25 PM] ONI#6888
your sending eth to your account right?


[05/09/2021 2:25 PM] usn5530#5530
yeah


[05/09/2021 2:25 PM] ONI#6888
then you will withdrawal


[05/09/2021 2:26 PM] ONI#6888
ok


[05/09/2021 2:26 PM] ONI#6888
smart contract calls such as withdrawing from a vault cost way more than just sending eth


[05/09/2021 2:26 PM] usn5530#5530
hmm the withdraw went through... I got 0 dollars and the fee was 280 usd


[05/09/2021 2:26 PM] ONI#6888
but this is gas pricing (in gwei) for all eth transactions


[05/09/2021 2:27 PM] usn5530#5530
oh I see


[05/09/2021 2:27 PM] ONI#6888
uh


[05/09/2021 2:27 PM] ONI#6888
I thought you were sending eth?


[05/09/2021 2:27 PM] usn5530#5530
Yeah sorry I got 0 dollars worth of eth


[05/09/2021 2:27 PM] ONI#6888
can you dm me your address


[05/09/2021 2:28 PM] usn5530#5530
Oh shoot it's also now not in yearn...


[05/09/2021 2:28 PM] usn5530#5530
yep

[05/09/2021 4:13 PM] Arnold#8812
Hey all 🙂 is there some sort of gas estimate for both token placement in vaults, and withdrawals? I'm trying to figure out a general idea of total gas fees  before investing in vaults.


[05/09/2021 4:16 PM] j.#6352
You can make a mock transaction by depositing without clicking confirm on metamask. This way, you can see the estimated gas costs, and also adjust gwei for different scenarios

{Reactions}
👍 

[05/09/2021 4:35 PM] Arnold#8812
Thanks, I got that far, but specifically on the withdraw the gas fees are not reflected correctly. Deposit shows the realistic gas fees, but on the withdraw doesn't make any sense the numbers shown.


[05/09/2021 4:35 PM] Arnold#8812
As I don't actually have anything in a vault, I've heard from the help section on the site that the gas fees on withdraw are not reflected correctly.


[05/09/2021 4:36 PM] Arnold#8812
'If the gas prices are crazy high, that means there is an error and the transaction will not be able to process.'


[05/09/2021 4:37 PM] Arnold#8812
..' For instance if you are trying to deposit a token you don't have'.

[05/09/2021 4:37 PM] Arnold#8812
Are the withdraw gas fees pretty similar to the deposit fees?


[05/09/2021 4:38 PM] Arnold#8812
if that is so I can just use that as a base reference


[05/09/2021 4:40 PM] Arnold#8812
Deposit fee: 0.0072 ETH
withdraw Fee: 1.138885 ETH?!


[05/09/2021 5:19 PM] vany#0365
Yes they should be similar. 1.13 eth fee is the wallet telling you the tc would fail.

Gas limit is 163408 on vault withdrawal

{Reactions}

[05/09/2021 5:30 PM] Fistodoom#0846
at 110 GWEI that's 0.017975 ETH


[05/09/2021 5:31 PM] Fistodoom#0846
it's much higher if you're withdrawing to a different token, 858238 limit


[05/09/2021 5:36 PM] Fistodoom#0846
it may be higher btw depending on the number of strategies a vault uses; I'm not sure


[05/10/2021 4:53 AM] Arnold#8812

[05/10/2021 5:28 AM] sinisterminister#0314
Hi, I’ve got around 5k in the crvYBUSD v1 vault which is now no longer active. Moving it to v2 costs around 500$ in gas — which is more than double of what v1 earned me up to now. Not sure how to proceed... Anyone?


[05/10/2021 5:29 AM] ONI#6888
I would for now wait to migrate till gas comes down


[05/10/2021 5:34 AM] sinisterminister#0314
Ok but I have time to do this, right?


[05/10/2021 5:34 AM] ONI#6888
yes no rush


[05/10/2021 5:34 AM] sinisterminister#0314
Tnx


[05/10/2021 5:45 AM] sinisterminister#0314
One more question: what’s a realistic gas price level? How much can it realistically come down? Would you recommend to migrate at, say, 200$ gas fee?


[05/10/2021 6:02 AM] glori4#9940
Have you been able to figure out how to withdraw `TUSD`? I have the same problem.


[05/10/2021 6:04 AM] glori4#9940
Do you know if this will be fixed?


[05/10/2021 6:07 AM] ONI#6888
I would do it based on $ value but gwei value


[05/10/2021 6:07 AM] ONI#6888
if you get migrate under 50 gwei that would be good


[05/10/2021 6:08 AM] ONI#6888
For tusd vault its just expensive due to the smart contracts and interactions, not sure there are any plans to fix it currently.


[05/10/2021 6:09 AM] ONI#6888
I believe you and swap into a cheaper vault via snowswap then withdrawal from that vault


[05/10/2021 10:56 AM] sinisterminister#0314
When you say 50 gwei or when the average transaction fee is 390 gwei currently according to eth gas station: what i nonetheless don’t get yet is the conversion to $... how can a transaction fee even reach 100$? even 1000 gwei don’t translate into 100$. what do I miss? sorry if it’s a silly/basic question...

[05/10/2021 11:15 AM] ONI#6888
Gwei isn't $ check Gasnow.org for gas pricing. I mean when it's below 50 gwei you can withdraw for the cheapest transactions you will get.


[05/10/2021 11:16 AM] ONI#6888
You can pay lots for complex transactions on eth. Deploying a new uni v3 pool cost 1000$ or so.


[05/10/2021 11:16 AM] ONI#6888
But normal withdrawal fees are anywhere from 30 to up to 300$ I believe depending on the vault and gas prices


[05/10/2021 1:34 PM] CHRJake The Cowboy#4289
the 2% management fee and the 20% performance fee go directly to the treasury?

So Im pretty new into this. Two main questions: 1) What is the difference between Curve 3 pool and Yearn 3CRV? 2) I’ve seen that you can use Zapper.fi to easily enter Curve 3 Pool, but is there a similar way to zap into 3CRV? Would appreciate if someone can explain or point me to where to find answers online


[05/10/2021 5:34 PM] j.#6352
1. Curve 3pool is a liquidity pool on Curve with DAI USDT USDC. Yearn 3CRV is a vault that farms on Curve's 3pool


[05/10/2021 5:34 PM] j.#6352
2. Yes. Just search for 'yearn' in the search bar under the pool tab

hello whats the difference between the wbtc badger vault and the yearn vault?


[05/10/2021 11:42 PM] vany#0365
badger provides their own tokens as extra rewards and they have a .5% withdraw fee. otherwise they take your deposit and put it into the yearn vault


[05/11/2021 12:45 AM] 0xmilk#7568
I just wanna confirm... the tx fee is roughly 200 USD to deposit in a vault because of all the different txs that are occurring behind the scenes? I thought tx fees were subsidized by deposits to vaults


[05/11/2021 1:45 AM] vany#0365
you have to pay the initial deposit, once its in the vault we pay for the gas to move your funds around and farm


[05/11/2021 2:53 AM] ONI#6888
also gas fees on eth are currently high due to dog(e)coin fomo, I would wait to do anything till gas drops below 70 gwei, its currently at 218 gwei.


[05/11/2021 8:49 AM] 0xmilk#7568
Thank you! Two quick follow up questions: 1. What site do you use for gas costs I’m trying to find the one I like the most 2. I heard that some vaults get retired after a period of time - is this true or will I always be able to find my vault on the yearn.finance website once I deposit my funds?


[05/11/2021 9:00 AM] ONI#6888
Yes you will always be able to see your vaults. And use Gasnow.org for gas pricing they also have a chrome/brave extension I like and use.

[05/11/2021 9:07 AM] Mouche#2278
Newbie question: can you use several instruments in Yearn in sequence? If so, is there any breakdown of the different options available? Or best practices perhaps.


[05/11/2021 9:11 AM] Mouche#2278
Like, is the idea that you get CRV tokens when for instance adding USDC to the USDC vault, which you then can add into another vault, say the ironbank ?


[05/11/2021 10:08 AM] j.#6352
You don't get CRV for depositing USDC into the USDC vault


[05/11/2021 10:39 AM] Mouche#2278
And there are no options for using several instruments at Yearn in sequence?


[05/11/2021 10:40 AM] arberx#3367
Explain


[05/11/2021 10:40 AM] arberx#3367
In sequence how?


[05/11/2021 10:46 AM] Mouche#2278
Sorry I think I misunderstood. I thought there were concepts where entering one vault (or perhaps a pool at curve) would generate a token that then could be put in another Yearn vault.


[05/11/2021 10:46 AM] j.#6352
You might be thinking of the individual strategies that do those actions on behalf of depositors/users


[05/11/2021 10:47 AM] j.#6352
Those actions are done by strategies so that users wont have to do multiple actions themselves


[05/11/2021 10:48 AM] Mouche#2278
Ah  I see, so that’s the strategies. Always internal in the vaults themselves and not something you would need to create as an individual using the service.


[05/11/2021 12:14 PM] MarlKarx#3791
with gas prices this insane, what is the most economical way to get into a vault with $ from an exchange? I stupidly converted all my gains into usdc on the exchange in anticipation of depositing into usdc vault, but now I'm thinking I should have just bought ETH. In metamask, its quoting me $300+ to swap around $80 from USDC to ETH 😆


[05/11/2021 12:14 PM] arberx#3367
maybe dharma, but doesn't support v2 vaults


[05/11/2021 12:17 PM] MarlKarx#3791
but is it generally correct that just starting with ETH is better for anything defi related? Like even though the goal is to put everything into usdc and put it in a pool, I shouldn't have started with USDC on the exchange?


[05/11/2021 12:17 PM] arberx#3367
Well that's the easiest way to get usdc


[05/11/2021 12:18 PM] arberx#3367
DeFi is hard on eth for smaller amounts, would suggest matic, or waiting until gas lowers


[05/11/2021 12:19 PM] MarlKarx#3791
thanks. looking at Dharma now, will it eventually support v2 vaults ?


[05/11/2021 12:20 PM] arberx#3367
No clue, but the usdc v1 vault is pretty decent still

[05/11/2021 1:48 PM] j.#6352
always monitor gas prices before sending out important txs https://www.gasnow.org/


[05/11/2021 1:48 PM] j.#6352
your first tx is at 198 gwei. the second is 233


[05/11/2021 1:49 PM] j.#6352
the second one wont confirm before the first one does


[05/11/2021 1:49 PM] j.#6352
you can either wait for gas to go down or you can bump up the 198 gwei tx


[05/11/2021 1:49 PM] caravaggio#8803
Oh so it was pretty slow


[05/11/2021 1:50 PM] caravaggio#8803
I totally didn't check thanks for the heads up


[05/11/2021 1:51 PM] caravaggio#8803
Are you saying the second tx wont go ahead? Sorry for the basic questions


[05/11/2021 1:53 PM] j.#6352
yes. it will only confirm after the first one does. an address can only send out one tx to confirm at a time. if you send out a first tx with low gas like 50 and then send out 100 txs all at 1000 gwei, they wont confirm until the first one at 50 gwei does because the rest are queued


[05/11/2021 1:53 PM] j.#6352
so no matter how high gas you put for further txs, theyll still wait for the first one, the slow one


[05/11/2021 1:54 PM] j.#6352
to speed up the first one, you can send out the same exact tx with higher gas, but with the same nonce as the first one


[05/11/2021 1:55 PM] j.#6352
in your case, you'll want to set the nonce to 19


[05/11/2021 1:55 PM] j.#6352
every tx your wallet address sends out that is confirmed will incrementally increase this number by 1


[05/11/2021 1:56 PM] j.#6352
it's like a queue number (not really but for this purpose it is)


[05/11/2021 1:56 PM] j.#6352
the second tx you sent out with 233 gwei has a nonce of 20


[05/11/2021 1:57 PM] j.#6352
so 19 has to confirm first before 20, 21, 22...

to cancel, just send 0 eth to yourself with high gas and nonce 20


[05/11/2021 1:59 PM] j.#6352
or if your wallet has a cancel button, it does the same. just set gas accordingly

If I let it fail how much are you usually charged, the full gas fee?


[05/11/2021 1:59 PM] j.#6352
i dont remember. let me check my failed txs lol


[05/11/2021 2:00 PM] caravaggio#8803
It seems getting things wrong on the ETH blockchain can be an expensive mistake


[05/11/2021 2:00 PM] j.#6352
looks like it does. cancelling it yourself might be cheaper


[05/11/2021 2:01 PM] caravaggio#8803
Blimey. OK and J if I leave 19 to just go at a snails pace it will eventually finish right?


[05/11/2021 2:02 PM] caravaggio#8803
I am in no rush for it. And baring in mind I am gonna lose out on the failed tx fee I am loathed to put any more in to this withdrawal


[05/11/2021 2:02 PM] j.#6352
yup. if it's a tx that doesnt involve anything time sensitive like swaps


[05/11/2021 2:03 PM] caravaggio#8803
Yeah it's literally taking out of the pool into eth which I wanted to withdraw


[05/11/2021 2:04 PM] caravaggio#8803
I should have just migrated it over to v2 🙄


[05/11/2021 2:10 PM] caravaggio#8803
OK just set up another tx for the 20 nonce with high gwei. Hopefully that does the trick. Thanks J

Hi, I've used couple of vaults and it worked fine, but I'm facing issue with crvIB. When I click Deposit it asks to sign a transaction as usual, but I did it twice. After that nothing happened. and When I click Deposit again, I don't get any prompt and nothing happens as well. I doubt it is related to the UI because I tried to use yearn.fi and faced the same issue, but at least I gave me some kind of generic error. I'll post a snapshot shortly.

[05/11/2021 2:58 PM] MarlKarx#3791
im kind of dense and having trouble conceptualizing the value of the yusdc token and it's fluctuations (right now its at $1.06).  If this number keeps rising, you get fewer yUSDC tokens when you enter the pool..this I understand. But is there a scenario (aside from hacks/contract issues) where yusdc goes down to 1.00, and you actually lose money by being in the pool and come out negative ?


[05/11/2021 3:00 PM] arberx#3367
Only in a exploit.


[05/11/2021 3:00 PM] arberx#3367
Yusdc is the share price


[05/11/2021 3:00 PM] arberx#3367
Yearn strats farm, no IL


[05/11/2021 3:00 PM] arberx#3367
Usually


[05/11/2021 3:02 PM] MarlKarx#3791
how much can this share price diverge from USDC value over time? also, is it worth timing your entry during the little spikes where it goes to 1.00 or totally irrelevant?


[05/11/2021 3:02 PM] MarlKarx#3791
i'm looking at the chart on zerion


[05/11/2021 3:04 PM] arberx#3367
No it won’t drop


[05/11/2021 3:05 PM] arberx#3367
Your yusdc represent your percentage of the vault holdings


[05/11/2021 3:05 PM] arberx#3367
So as vault holdings increase, the amount of usdc it takes to hold a equal amount of yusdc increases


[05/11/2021 3:06 PM] MarlKarx#3791
ah ok thank you

Couple questions about BRANDING: 
Under what license is the YFI logo released? 
Is it  Creative Commons, MIT, public domain or trademarked? 
Is there an "official brand manual" with the proper fonts, pantone colors, ect?

You should take a look at nexus mutual.


[05/11/2021 5:02 PM] peteris#3896
@Pueblo that's cover that can be taken out separately by users right, there isn't a formal insurance fund/cover offer built in at the moment?


[05/11/2021 5:07 PM] Pueblo#6949
Yes.
I'm new to yearn and still learning. Don't know if there's something built in.

With the usdc vault v2 - can  you farm the yusdc lp token that you receive?


[05/11/2021 8:14 PM] vany#0365
the token you receive represents your share of the vault. the vault is using the usdc you deposited to earn you more usdc


[05/11/2021 11:44 PM] MarlKarx#3791

hi


[05/12/2021 2:54 AM] machard#7162
when i select usdc/eth/... to go out of a pool the max still returns the number of curve lp token


[05/12/2021 2:54 AM] machard#7162
does it mean zap out is not available ? or does it mean it fails if i put more than whats possible ?


[05/12/2021 2:55 AM] machard#7162
or it just mean that i select how many lp token i want to take out and then i will just get what the swap rate will be when i withdraw ?


[05/12/2021 3:09 AM] zeno#8575

[05/12/2021 6:30 AM] ONI#6888
you can only zap up to your max amount

another question. after i got in the pool, my balance increased right away and now it stopped.
How does it work ? (i guess its related to how long ive been in the pool, and/or when rewards are harvested ?)


[05/12/2021 7:40 AM] j.#6352
Which pool?


[05/12/2021 7:41 AM] j.#6352
!faq harvest frequency


[05/12/2021 7:41 AM] yfi-faq-bot#6095


{Embed}
Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[05/12/2021 7:41 AM] machard#7162

what can i do ?


[05/12/2021 8:58 AM] lyurgin#5568
Hello - total noob question here:  I am a little confused about the functionality of the yveCRV-Eth asset. I thought that the deposit would be perpetually re-staked and that it would pay out Pickle SLP weekly.   I deposited some ether into this about a month ago and the first week the contract paid out, but I haven't received any additional deposits and the contract appears to have been completed (viewing from etherscan) with out any indication of the another round of re staking or anything.    Am I misunderstanding the process for this asset or missing a step for it to complete?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you!


[05/12/2021 9:02 AM] schwifty#6592

hey guys, can someone explain to me why when I look at any yVault contract on etherscan the performanceFee is 1000? I would have expected it to be 2000 since the UI shows that there is a 20% performance fee on the v2 vaults.

[05/12/2021 10:40 AM] FUDlife#3912
Yes, I think there are a bunch of people in this same situation. If there is a way to migrate within IB while keeping collateral position I think people would gladly pay a premium, avoids having to unwind manually


[05/12/2021 11:50 AM] 0xSLH#0662
Hi friends. I have some deposits in ETH denominated yvaults, and I'm looking to borrow <5% of that collateral in USD denominated stablecoin to pay for a small home reno project, that ideally I could pay off with my yvault yield over the next 12 months. Is there a platform/project that allows for that? Is it CREAM? I would prefer not to withdraw/sell my yvault deposits if that's possible, and I would also love my debt to stay denominated in dollars so that it will shrink in ETH as the price of ETH grows.

[05/13/2021 12:59 PM] j.#6352
nope


[05/13/2021 1:02 PM] Bart#2895
Ok thank you. Can the contract be updated to allow this functionality? Seems quite a bit is locked forever


[05/13/2021 1:06 PM] zeno#8575
No, contracts are immutable.


[05/13/2021 1:22 PM] Bart#2895
That's what I thought but wanted to check with the experts, thank you both for the quick responses


[05/13/2021 1:23 PM] ONI#6888
what coin did you send?


[05/13/2021 1:23 PM] ONI#6888
usdc and usdt maybe

Hello, I need some help with Full metal farmer vault


[05/13/2021 1:57 PM] ONI#6888
What is the problem?


[05/13/2021 1:57 PM] Irish#1321
so my shares dont add up to the amount I deposited


[05/13/2021 1:57 PM] ONI#6888
they wont


[05/13/2021 1:58 PM] ONI#6888
because share price is always increasing


[05/13/2021 1:58 PM] ONI#6888
shares do not equal deposits


[05/13/2021 1:59 PM] ONI#6888
vault tokens (via etherscan) * shareprice = aclx


[05/13/2021 2:00 PM] Irish#1321
ok I was getting scared there


[05/13/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
no worries


[05/13/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
that vault has grown alot!


[05/13/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
you can get apy for the lifetime of the vault by looking at shareprice


[05/13/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
1.23


[05/13/2021 2:00 PM] ONI#6888
= 23% apy over the lifetime of the vault


[05/13/2021 2:01 PM] ONI#6888
so if you deposited when share price was 1.0 you made 23% return


[05/13/2021 2:01 PM] ONI#6888
since share price started at 1.0 for that vault (and almost all vaults for that matter)


[05/13/2021 2:02 PM] ONI#6888
but sometimes you deposit when share price is at 1.05 or something so to calculate your specific return you need to know what the share price was when you entered the vault, or just do the math I showed above.


[05/13/2021 2:06 PM] Irish#1321
I sent you a dm ONI


[05/13/2021 4:29 PM] saltyfacu#1111
Because the performance fee is divided in two: 10% for Yearn Treasury and 10% for the strategist. 

The value you see is Yearn’s share. The other 10% is in the strat

Hi guys, Noob question from me.

Say I've deposited into a vault in Yearn thru MM. Could i move the token I receive from them to a Trezor / Ledger directly?

Or does the  concept of unstaking then re-staking thru a hardware wallet applies in this case?


[05/13/2021 9:23 PM] indytheoracle#6404
Hi folks, can someone help me understand where my yva3CRV went when i tried to withdraw from the vault?


[05/13/2021 9:24 PM] indytheoracle#6404
I used the withdraw button on the vault and didn't do anything fancy


[05/13/2021 9:34 PM] indytheoracle#6404
seems like a bug... the last line shouldn't be 0


[05/13/2021 9:34 PM] indytheoracle#6404

Hey team, I just removed my yvecrv liquidity from pickle and sushi to claim my 3crv but on yearn but says that I have no claimable 3crv? Any insight would be much appreciated. Have been in the sushi and pickle pools for well over 2 months. I have asked previously what would happen with the 3crv rewards while my yveCRV was staked in sushi/pickle and was told that it would be claimable when I got the yveCRV back in my wallet.


[05/14/2021 5:40 AM] j.#6352
Have you tried crv.ape.tax?


[05/14/2021 6:15 AM] Riptide717#4722

Does anyone know what's happening with the a3CRV vault? Withdrawals are disabled after bizarre share price action, and grafana is showing 0 in strategy and 0 free...


[05/14/2021 12:41 PM] vany#0365
A write up should be coming out soon. No user funds were lost or at risk. To avoid any further issues the vault was paused while devs put together a permanent fix


[05/14/2021 12:56 PM] ayybee#0185
does DUSD v1 for sure have 0% withdrawal fee?


[05/14/2021 12:57 PM] ayybee#0185
@kx9x


[05/14/2021 1:00 PM] vany#0365
If it has a migrate button fees should be off. You can check by hovering over “v1”


[05/14/2021 1:02 PM] ayybee#0185
yea it says 0% when i hover. i am curious about the migrating, does that mean v1 will be deprecated soon? seems to make more sense to me to deposit to v1 over v2 for now given no withdrawal fee...just want to make sure im not missing something


[05/14/2021 1:02 PM] kx9x#3778
I believe v2 will have the crv voter boost and v1 won't


[05/14/2021 1:03 PM] kx9x#3778
so I'd tend to use v2


[05/14/2021 1:06 PM] vany#0365
V1 will no longer earn returns and only v2 will. Best to migrate


[05/14/2021 1:07 PM] ayybee#0185
Thanks guys 👍🏻


[05/14/2021 1:10 PM] kx9x#3778
still bagholding two v1 vaults heh

ain't migrating until gas is negative!


[05/14/2021 1:11 PM] kx9x#3778
well, I'll probably withdraw and reconsolidate my stables into only a couple pools instead of like 4 different ones


[05/14/2021 1:11 PM] kx9x#3778
just need to figure out which

does yearn work better with ledger or trezor or about the same? any preferences 👀


[05/14/2021 1:50 PM] vany#0365
About the same. I connect with metamask which supports both ledger and trezor

God what a shit experience


[05/14/2021 2:12 PM] Fistodoom#0846
Is it because I have a tiny balance of USDT borrowed? I paid 100% and the UI showed a 0 balance when I withdrew ETH, but now it shows $0.33 debt


[05/14/2021 2:14 PM] Fistodoom#0846
This must happen o everyone. Are there thousands of people with tiny debts because it’s not possible to pay off 100%?

[05/14/2021 2:16 PM] vany#0365
Iron Bank is hosted on yearn but it is a cream product. you can join their discord here: https://discord.gg/pjSEsBRC


[05/14/2021 2:17 PM] Fistodoom#0846
I paid 100% of debt shown, but in the 20 seconds it took to pay the debt it accrued $0.33 in interest


[05/14/2021 2:17 PM] Fistodoom#0846
Then the yearn UI shows a 0 balance, and attempting to withdraw 100% of my ETH failed because I have a tiny debt


[05/14/2021 2:18 PM] Fistodoom#0846
So I’m out an extra $110 and I’ll need to keep a ridiculously tiny position on in perpetuity

might be this error instead, but I think the cream team will know more

ideally, the yearn UI would convey this information to the user...


[05/14/2021 2:30 PM] ONI#6888

oh.... this is on v1 yearn UI... bleh


[05/14/2021 2:31 PM] Fistodoom#0846
There is no v2 lending UI that I’m aware of


[05/14/2021 2:31 PM] Fistodoom#0846
It doesn’t even make me aware that I’m using Cream


[05/14/2021 2:32 PM] Fistodoom#0846
A decent UX would prompt me to overpay by like 0.1% and then refund the change in the same transaction


[05/14/2021 2:32 PM] vany#0365
agree ui is not obvious, but this is where its indicated

you never see that screen if you go from yearn.finance

yearn isn't even using the same contracts that cream is in their dApp, so it's not like you can go there and view your balances either

😱


[05/14/2021 2:45 PM] kx9x#3778
that is.... concerning to say the least


[05/14/2021 2:47 PM] Fistodoom#0846
this is the Cream ETH contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xD06527D5e56A3495252A528C4987003b712860eE


[05/14/2021 2:47 PM] kx9x#3778
oh... yearn wrapped cream ether


[05/14/2021 2:47 PM] kx9x#3778
so it is different


[05/14/2021 2:48 PM] Fistodoom#0846
and here is the USDT contract cream uses: https://etherscan.io/address/0x797aab1ce7c01eb727ab980762ba88e7133d2157


[05/14/2021 2:48 PM] Fistodoom#0846

[05/15/2021 4:28 AM] ONI#6888
on yearn.finance we limit it to 1% slippage


[05/15/2021 4:28 AM] ONI#6888
on zapper.fi you can set slippage to what your comfortable with


[05/15/2021 5:34 AM] Navi#4356
Is the yfin.one airdrop a scam? Does it have anything to do with yfi?


[05/15/2021 5:35 AM] Navi#4356
Because it says yfin.one is a subbranch of yearn.finance


[05/15/2021 5:35 AM] Navi#4356
Is it tru?


[05/15/2021 5:36 AM] ONI#6888
its a scam


[05/15/2021 5:36 AM] Navi#4356
You sure?


[05/15/2021 5:36 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[05/15/2021 5:37 AM] Navi#4356
So yfin is not related to yfi?


[05/15/2021 5:37 AM] ONI#6888
no


[05/15/2021 5:38 AM] ONI#6888
our code is open source anyone can fork yearn, but if they did that 1 doesnt make it legit, and 2 doesnt mean it isnt a scam


[05/15/2021 5:38 AM] ONI#6888
so its not related to us, and yes its a scam, better off just buying WOOFY


[05/15/2021 5:39 AM] Navi#4356
So y don't u take action against them coz they are saying its a part of yfi?


[05/15/2021 5:39 AM] ONI#6888
no I never said that


[05/15/2021 5:39 AM] Navi#4356
Isn't it illegal?


[05/15/2021 5:41 AM] ONI#6888
we dont take action against anyone, they are free to do what they want as yearn is open source. But it is a scam and I wouldnt touch it with a 10 foot pool.

[05/15/2021 8:10 AM] ONI#6888
that seems like an error


[05/15/2021 8:10 AM] ONI#6888
are you zapping or just withdrawal from a vault at yearn.finance?

v1 vault


[05/15/2021 8:59 AM] KT#2243
if i use V2, it just says "your transcation has been sent to the network"


[05/15/2021 8:59 AM] KT#2243
and nothing happens, for hours.


[05/15/2021 12:56 PM] FUDlife#3912
Hi, wondering if there is any plan to add the v2 3crv vault as a collateral option on the IB and then provide any sort of migration tool to allow v1 3crv collateral to migrate even if it is currently in use at say 80%


[05/15/2021 12:56 PM] FUDlife#3912
This would be massively helpful


[05/15/2021 4:55 PM] rubberjesus#6361
Gas to withdraw is extremely high and has been for a while. Any reason why? I want to withdraw but havent been for 2-3 months at least.

Wait until gas is under 50, which might happen over the weekend. https://www.gasnow.org/


[05/15/2021 7:18 PM] rubberjesus#6361
I was also trying when gas was super low two weeks ago but it was around $400


[05/15/2021 8:27 PM] rubberjesus#6361
It’s $500 now. I just tried. Still super expensive


[05/15/2021 9:55 PM] NitroNed#5367
I deposited some YFI to the yield app and when I tried to remove it, it wants to charge me a network fee equal to my deposit.

Have you tried withdrawing something other than aLink?


[05/16/2021 1:10 AM] rubberjesus#6361
I have not recently. But aLink has always given me this problem


[05/16/2021 4:27 AM] LONO#3863
Howdy! So I was under the impression I would be able to "zap" ETH into the yearn Crv.stETH vault through the vaults page. I was able to approve of the transaction, but i'm not able to deposit. I see no option to choose ETH either, just crvSTETH in the dropdown menu. I tried simply typing in the amount in ETH but I cannot click deposit. Any help would be appreciated!


[05/16/2021 4:30 AM] j.#6352
It should autodetect whatever is in your wallet. Sometimes it can take a few seconds to list it all. Otherwise, try a hard refresh ctrl+shift+r


[05/16/2021 4:30 AM] LONO#3863
hmm strange. Ya i've tried 3 differeng browsers, cleared cache in every one


[05/16/2021 4:31 AM] LONO#3863
sat on the page for much longer than a few second


[05/16/2021 4:31 AM] LONO#3863
Brave/Chrome/Firefox so far haha


[05/16/2021 4:31 AM] LONO#3863
it says available: 0.00000 but there's ETH in my wallet


[05/16/2021 4:31 AM] j.#6352
try it on zapper directly https://zapper.fi/invest?protocol=yearn&contractAddress=0xdcd90c7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770b4325&modal=invest


[05/16/2021 4:31 AM] LONO#3863
ok I will try that. Do you think i'll have to do another approval transaction?


[05/16/2021 4:32 AM] j.#6352
yea. it's a different contract


[05/16/2021 4:32 AM] LONO#3863
thought so. I'll keep trying this for a minute but that will be my backup solution. Looks like it'll work.


[05/16/2021 4:32 AM] LONO#3863
guess i'm lucky gas is a bit low rn


[05/16/2021 4:32 AM] j.#6352
i just tried it on the yearn website


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] j.#6352
i can see my eth in the list


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] j.#6352

[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] LONO#3863
how strange hmm. Ledger Nano X?


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] j.#6352
metamask


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] LONO#3863
Zapper see's my ETH just fine


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] LONO#3863
AHHH


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] LONO#3863
let me try metamask!


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] j.#6352
but connected through trezor


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] LONO#3863
might not have to do the approval again that way


[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] j.#6352
you should interface your ledger through metamask

{Reactions}
💯 

[05/16/2021 4:33 AM] LONO#3863
cool will do, I was just using the ledger selection on yearn's page


[05/16/2021 4:34 AM] j.#6352
if you have your ledger connected to metamask, try that. should work fine


[05/16/2021 4:34 AM] LONO#3863
"always just use metamask" going to be my new guiding principle


[05/16/2021 4:35 AM] ONI#6888
This doesnt work very well sadly


[05/16/2021 4:35 AM] ONI#6888
best to always use ledger through metamask on yearn


[05/16/2021 4:50 AM] LONO#3863

[05/16/2021 10:38 AM] rubberjesus#6361
Gas is very low right now yet it is still costing me ~$300 to remove 18 aLink from the vault. This has been an extremely frustrating user experience and makes me not want to use the other vaults

[05/16/2021 10:56 AM] arberx#3367
alink has been inactive for a while, and as I know more funds are active in the strategy not yielding anything.


[05/16/2021 10:56 AM] arberx#3367
That makes withdrawing unfortunate as the funds must be pulled from the strat


[05/16/2021 10:57 AM] arberx#3367
Look at the vault on etherscan and check out the latest withdrawals


[05/16/2021 10:58 AM] arberx#3367
Try to find the lowest gas cost one, and set your limit to that in the transaction. Might take a while though.


[05/16/2021 10:58 AM] arberx#3367
You can also try withdrawing from zapper as their estimates are more precise


[05/16/2021 10:59 AM] rubberjesus#6361

Try to set the gas price and gas limit to that in your transaction


[05/16/2021 11:08 AM] arberx#3367
And it’ll probably get mined sometime


[05/16/2021 11:08 AM] arberx#3367
Please dyor first though


[05/16/2021 11:09 AM] rubberjesus#6361
It brings the transaction cost down to around $200 but still really high


[05/16/2021 11:11 AM] arberx#3367
Yeah unfortunately that’s the case.  I’ll ask around see if the devs can pull funds from non yielding strategies


[05/16/2021 11:11 AM] arberx#3367
That will make withdrawals cheaper, but no promises


[05/16/2021 11:13 AM] rubberjesus#6361
Thanks man. It has been really expensive for probably around 6 months to withdraw from the aLink vault. If you search for aLink theres other people with the same experience

So I have a small amount of USD and I just want to get started


[05/16/2021 12:12 PM] j.#6352
Do you have any ETH or DAI or whatever in your wallet?


[05/16/2021 12:12 PM] j.#6352
Even some obscure tokens may work


[05/16/2021 12:13 PM] Nugz#8470
I bought some ETH yesterday… couldn’t figure out how to zap in so I ended up buying WETH just to test something out


[05/16/2021 12:13 PM] Nugz#8470
I want to try again


[05/16/2021 12:13 PM] j.#6352
Do you have the ETH in your wallet?


[05/16/2021 12:13 PM] j.#6352
It's recommended that you use Metamask


[05/16/2021 12:14 PM] Nugz#8470
And what does this WETH do for me. I understand it’s “wrapped”. Is it in the vault I want or do I need to move it more


[05/16/2021 12:14 PM] Nugz#8470
I can get more ETH or move some wherever


[05/16/2021 12:14 PM] j.#6352
Let's take it step by step. You can use WETH too yes


[05/16/2021 12:14 PM] Nugz#8470
I am willing to try metamask


[05/16/2021 12:15 PM] Nugz#8470
Ok let’s say, for example sake, that I’m an impulsive idiot and I live very cheap and don’t have lots of expenses.  I have been learning about crypto this year and I have lots of extra money from work that I want to use to figure out better investing strategies


[05/16/2021 12:16 PM] Nugz#8470
I already bought WETH but I want to try more things and learn what’s going on


[05/16/2021 12:17 PM] Nugz#8470
I work two jobs and have lots of extra money every week but not tons of time to figure this all out right away


[05/16/2021 12:18 PM] Nugz#8470
Just give me a suggestion of something I could try to learn what’s going on not necessarily make money. I have Coinbase and Coinbase pro and some coin in Celsius now but I can use new money to get started on yearn … so do you suggest I get metamask as step 1?


[05/16/2021 12:22 PM] j.#6352
0. Look up and understand mnemonic seed phrases for security
1. Setup Metamask
2. Send ETH to your Metamask wallet address
3. Go to yearn.finance
4. Connect wallet (top right)
5. Look for ETH v2 vault
6. Approve deposit transaction
7. Deposit ETH


[05/16/2021 12:22 PM] j.#6352
This is the easiest and fastest way i think. The ETH vault may not have face-melting yields but it's the easiest to get into


[05/16/2021 12:23 PM] Nugz#8470
Ok I am getting metamask and I understand seed phrases


[05/16/2021 12:24 PM] Nugz#8470
Non face melting yields are fine. I have lost 2 ETH on gambling websites just messing around and I’m pretty sure I could never withdraw anyways because not legal in my country.


[05/16/2021 12:24 PM] Nugz#8470
I have more ETH but can I just buy more on metamask?  Or are they not a marketplace for that?


[05/16/2021 12:25 PM] j.#6352
You can. They integrated Wyre, but im sure it will be expensive. havent tried it myself


[05/16/2021 12:32 PM] Nugz#8470
Ok I made wallet on metamask.  I’m going to send ETH there and follow your steps.  Thanks for the help. Can I private message you if I have more questions?  I appreciate your guidance very much


[05/16/2021 12:33 PM] Nugz#8470

Hi, I cannot withdraw USDC from the crvBUSD vault, neither on yearn, nor on zapper. I use a ledger nano x with metamask. On yearn I get an "Error Swapping Tokens 1" message (and the request never gets sent to metamask) and on zapper I get an "Error Swapping Tokens" message. Is it an issue of zapper at the moment?


[05/16/2021 5:13 PM] vany#0365
yes we have had reported issues with zapping out of vaults. what did you set your slippage on zapper? maybe try a little bigger than 1%? that has worked for a few people


[05/16/2021 6:54 PM] SprühwurstDeluxe#7067

And the same when selecting high gas fees


[05/16/2021 7:04 PM] vany#0365
if the zapper function is not working you can do it manually like the old days, withdraw the crvpool token and then go to curve to withdraw the stablecoins


[05/16/2021 7:07 PM] SprühwurstDeluxe#7067
I'll look into it, I've never interacted with curve directly. Their interface is a bit intimidating, but I'll give it a go.


[05/16/2021 9:08 PM] Octo#0887
Hi does anyone know of any articles or documentaiton I can look at on how to create a vault? I have seen people submit strategies and proposals, but I am unsure what the steps are to actually get a vault accepted for people to use. 

Second, can vaults accept multi assets like USDC, DAI, USDT for a strategy or can it only accept one token?

Could you walk me through curve on how or rather in which menu/tab I can withdraw them? As I said, I've never used curve directly (only through yearn) and I find it not very intuitive...


[05/17/2021 4:57 AM] ONI#6888
are you in busd v1 or v2 vault?


[05/17/2021 4:59 AM] SprühwurstDeluxe#7067
v2

Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for: extremely efficient stablecoin trading, low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.


[05/17/2021 4:59 AM] ONI#6888
you can withdrawal from here


[05/17/2021 5:14 AM] SprühwurstDeluxe#7067
I did it. Jesus, now I know why zapper is the way to go. On curve, it's GAS GAS GAS 🙂


[05/17/2021 5:14 AM] ONI#6888
in general curve interactions can be expensive

So, next question. I zapped BUSD into the yvBOOST vault (slippage limit 1%) and after depositing my balance on yearn.fi shows about 26% than the BUSD amount was. Is that disappeared amount the "Backscratcher" deposit or did something go wrong here? This is the transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3207e9743c8b41cdebcae1f63595a752133a5b7e00770c5de919e864e1f7dbeb

probably a bug in wallet connect or yearn ui where they cannot figure out your token balances


[05/17/2021 1:18 PM] kx9x#3778
your best bet is opening the dev console (f12) and seeing if there are any errors

If you really want to get into the vault, you can use curve.fi to deposit your eth for crvSTETH and then deposit that into the vault


[05/17/2021 2:00 PM] kx9x#3778
That it what the zap does

Hi, 
unfortunatelly I distributed my inital LP deposits a bit too much (while gas/eth was 'low':(, could be worse but well...) and now one by one is required to migrate to V2 versions. Is there a timeline/voting/plan to see how long the V2-versions will/might stick around. 
Never considered before, that i might need to migrate into another pool every 6months or so - expensive lesson i guess. Hence background of my quesiton, which pools to migrate and which pools to simply dissolve and merge.
secondly, probably not the right place here but, why are there 2 BUSD pools around now on curve/yearn? busdv2 and BUSD?
thirdly, is there anything already in the pipeline regarding polygon?


[05/17/2021 2:22 PM] YeahYeah#4347
Tried to get into curve to deposit the stETH and transactions kept failing over and over again. Unclear why.


[05/17/2021 2:24 PM] kx9x#3778
run out of gas?


[05/17/2021 2:24 PM] kx9x#3778
not sure why there are two busd pools on curve tbh. As for v2, I expect it to be longer lived than v1, but I haven't gotten an estimate from the team


[05/17/2021 2:24 PM] kx9x#3778
but there are currently no plans for a v3 yearn vault


[05/17/2021 2:24 PM] kx9x#3778
v2 has a much longer term design

{Reactions}
👍 

[05/17/2021 2:25 PM] kx9x#3778
v1 was kinda just a growing pain


[05/17/2021 2:25 PM] xfgdv#5789
thanks for the rapid response


[05/17/2021 2:25 PM] kx9x#3778
I am also a v1 user who hasn't migrated yet


[05/17/2021 2:25 PM] kx9x#3778
I have been in busd v1 for 7 months now


[05/17/2021 2:26 PM] kx9x#3778
and migrated to v2 for most before gas and eth got super expensive


[05/17/2021 2:26 PM] kx9x#3778
but now since migrating is super expensive, I have been waiting on migrating my busd v1


[05/17/2021 2:27 PM] xfgdv#5789
is there a list of what it actually costs (in gas) per migration? the gas fee estimation of like 100-200$ is not convincing...


[05/17/2021 2:28 PM] kx9x#3778
No list, but you can use etherscan as an effective list


[05/17/2021 2:28 PM] kx9x#3778
just see what others ended up paying


[05/17/2021 2:28 PM] kx9x#3778
gas used is variable, as is gas cost, but you can take an average of gas used for migrations


[05/17/2021 2:28 PM] xfgdv#5789
yeah esp as even the new one gives "only" 15%...


[05/17/2021 2:29 PM] xfgdv#5789

looks like most migrations use about 405,000-407,000 in gas


[05/17/2021 2:31 PM] kx9x#3778
and then the gas limit seems to be about double that, so the estimated cost is 2x higher than you will pay

[05/17/2021 2:31 PM] kx9x#3778
though this migration actually only used 177,000 gas


[05/17/2021 2:31 PM] kx9x#3778
wonder what makes it different


[05/17/2021 2:32 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, migrating yUSD is so cheap compared to others


[05/17/2021 2:59 PM] kx9x#3778
@Unknown also another consideration for the longevity of v2 is that yearn has multiple partners like pickle and badger who have built on top of v2

{Reactions}
👍 

[05/17/2021 2:59 PM] kx9x#3778
so any transition would result in much more churn


[05/17/2021 2:59 PM] kx9x#3778
also v2 is much more update-able than v1


[05/17/2021 2:59 PM] kx9x#3778
check out the most recent release:
https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/releases/tag/v0.4.0


[05/17/2021 3:00 PM] kx9x#3778
coordinating this many changes across so many vaults before would have been a nightmare


[05/17/2021 3:00 PM] kx9x#3778
also the dev team is much larger for v2


[05/17/2021 3:00 PM] kx9x#3778
so I think it is safe to say v2 will be around much longer than v1 since it doesn't suffer the same problem with regards to adaptability and updating

Hi there - I deposited ~220K USDC into the YBOOST vault via a ZAP, this has given me ~58K yveCRV... if I was to withdraw this and sell this on Sushi it nets (with slippage) at 132K USDC. Why is this?


[05/17/2021 3:36 PM] ONI#6888
can you send me the trx?

[05/17/2021 3:42 PM] ONI#6888
which vault?


[05/17/2021 3:45 PM] vany#0365
you want to leave it as yvboost instead of trying to sell as yvecrv. there is no incentives for yvecrv so there will be a lot of slilppage. yvboost should have less


[05/17/2021 3:45 PM] ironypirate#6195
OK


[05/17/2021 3:46 PM] vany#0365
also right now yvboost is trading at a discount to crv

you too, what UI did you use to zap into yvboost?


[05/18/2021 12:05 AM] arberx#3367
The difference is associated with the market price of crv being much less than yvboost

We really should warn


[05/18/2021 12:05 AM] arberx#3367
If the price difference is large and suggest market buy instead


[05/18/2021 12:05 AM] arberx#3367
@ONI ^


[05/18/2021 12:05 AM] ONI#6888
this is a zap issue


[05/18/2021 12:05 AM] arberx#3367
Ah


[05/18/2021 12:05 AM] ONI#6888
and afaik it was fixed


[05/18/2021 12:05 AM] arberx#3367
Okay


[05/18/2021 12:06 AM] ONI#6888
But if there is something wrong the team will fix it/make a statement


[05/18/2021 12:06 AM] kx9x#3778
I am not convinced. our UI is supposed to build that TX


[05/18/2021 12:06 AM] vany#0365
Want me to test a zap with crv?


[05/18/2021 12:06 AM] kx9x#3778
but it is building it with minYVTokens set to 0

hey i bridged WOOFY to polygon, and its been an hour with no sign of arrival


[05/18/2021 4:54 AM] N Ξ D#0001
i guess it just takes a while looking on chain


[05/18/2021 4:59 AM] N Ξ D#0001
wait, pretty sure i have it, just not showing on matic vigil


[05/18/2021 4:59 AM] N Ξ D#0001
or metamask lol


[05/18/2021 5:00 AM] lulzyk#0739
Hey guys, this might be asked a lot, but what does 'N/A' mean under the vaults Growth tab? eg. the crvBUSD pool used to have high APY but now it shows N/A


[05/18/2021 5:02 AM] j.#6352
does it not show in the matic wallet ui?


[05/18/2021 5:03 AM] N Ξ D#0001
solved: there was lag on matic explorer... while at the same time, i clicked the Add Token button from the Woofy UI, while I was on polygon chain, not mainnet. so it added the incorrect token


[05/18/2021 5:03 AM] N Ξ D#0001
so everything was working correctly in the end

💯 

[05/18/2021 5:21 AM] ONI#6888
So you got woofy on matic fine?


[05/18/2021 5:38 AM] vany#0365
i looked and it seems the matic bridge sends to a different woofy address than the 0xdoggo address


[05/18/2021 9:38 AM] N Ξ D#0001
i had woofy on matic fine but swapped back to mainnet due to uncertainty


[05/18/2021 9:39 AM] N Ξ D#0001
everything seems fine tho

Hey guys quick question: if I deposit ETH in the yvBOOST vault, why does it now say that I deposited the same amount into the WETH and ETH vaults?


[05/18/2021 9:59 AM] jlarghi#8353
Hi, cloud someone help me to know what is the difference between the two values:

[05/18/2021 9:59 AM] jlarghi#8353
the first value always is lower than the second


[05/18/2021 9:59 AM] jlarghi#8353
thanks!


[05/18/2021 10:00 AM] jlarghi#8353
doing the math, I understand the second value is the correct...


[05/18/2021 10:01 AM] ONI#6888
not sure what your saying?


[05/18/2021 10:07 AM] ONI#6888
Its supposed to be:
$ amount of holdings
Amount of deposit token


[05/18/2021 10:09 AM] jlarghi#8353
ahh ok, the first value is lower because usdc price right now is lower than $1 ?


[05/18/2021 10:09 AM] ONI#6888
should be yes


[05/18/2021 10:09 AM] ONI#6888
or the calculation atm is wrong


[05/18/2021 10:10 AM] jlarghi#8353
let me ask you last question, where I can find the price atm of crvDUSD?


[05/18/2021 10:10 AM] ONI#6888
what price do you want specifically?


[05/18/2021 10:11 AM] ONI#6888
how much your vault tokens are worth or how much the curve pool lp token crvDUSD is worth?


[05/18/2021 10:11 AM] jlarghi#8353
the first option


[05/18/2021 10:12 AM] ONI#6888
vault tokens is yvtoken * share price * crv virtual price


[05/18/2021 10:12 AM] ONI#6888
yvtoken from etherscan, share price from the vault contract or yearn.vision, https://curve.fi/dusd virtual price is here

Is yearn still doing those wrapper contracts that give dapps a percentage of the fees on money they bring in?


[05/18/2021 11:06 AM] kx9x#3778
yeah, badger and pickle use affiliate wrapper


[05/18/2021 11:06 AM] kx9x#3778
are you sure you are reading the UI correctly and not confusing deposited with amount to deposit? can you verify in your metamask TXs what you actually did?


[05/18/2021 11:07 AM] ME9#4653
Nice! Is this done permissionlessly, or would the project need to be whitelisted?


[05/18/2021 11:09 AM] ONI#6888
need to be whitelisted


[05/18/2021 11:09 AM] kx9x#3778

Ah, gotcha--I'm trying to help a project research. I think they already have ~10m in the vaults.


[05/18/2021 11:15 AM] 0xmilk#7568
yea my txs say that I deposited to this address: `0x5A0bade607eaca65A0FE6d1437E0e3EC2144d540`
which according to etherscan is the ZapYvWETH contract


[05/18/2021 11:18 AM] kx9x#3778
hmm, that means you deposited into the ETH vault


[05/18/2021 11:18 AM] kx9x#3778
wETH and ETH are the same vault, so they just show the same value deposited


[05/18/2021 11:18 AM] kx9x#3778
are you sure you clicked the right button? It seems like you clicked the deposit button on the wETH or ETH vault instead of the yvBOOST-ETH one


[05/18/2021 11:52 AM] 0xmilk#7568
oh well, guess I'll just have to deposit more I don't mind too much

Lido: How to earn the highest staking yield for ETH (Ethereum)
In this video, I show you how to earn the highest yield on ETH (Ethereum). This strategy uses Lido, which allows users to validate for ETH2 while keeping their capital liquid and free to deploy on different DeFi protocols and projects. When you stake with Lido, you receive a staked ETH token (stETH) which can then be deployed on Curve and Yearn ...

Hey! Everytime I try to click on "deposit" to deposit an asset in one of the vaults, the metamask window doesn't pop up. I only experience that with yearn (tried on Firefox and Brave same result). Can someone help? Thanks


[05/18/2021 1:17 PM] kx9x#3778
Does eth not show in the drop down for you? Confirm you have eth in your wallet. Does anything else show up?


[05/18/2021 1:25 PM] Makseem#2731
oh i didn't connect my wallet yet maybe that's why. Thanks 🙂

Hello folks,

I have some questions as it relates to the 'earn' feature - specifically around how it works and it's safety. Most of my questions are stemming from reading this article https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/is-yearn-finance-safe-to-use/

1) I'm looking to deposit USDC into Yearn. Am I correct in understanding that the USDC coins are moved around as needed to different protocols in search of the best yields?

2) In reading the 'potential for theft' section, it seems that there are some risks inherent to the moving around of the coins in terms of hacks or foul play. Can someone speak to this please?

3) I understand that Andre Cronje has credibility in this space but I'm merely asking this question to make sure I'm fully aware of the risks. For argument sake, if he decides to go rogue since the coins are being moved around in search of the best yield, is there anything stopping him from walking away with what I deposit?

I look forward to the responses and thank you in advance.

[05/18/2021 5:31 PM] Confused#3200
The deposit button does not seem to work. Are there other steps that need to be done before I can deposit to the vault

[05/18/2021 6:10 PM] MarlKarx#3791
I have few questions about how to insure what I put in the usdc vault.  Looking at Nexus Mutual seems like you have to use DAI to buy insurance for Yearn, however it's unclear if I can insure USDC deposited or only DAI. Can anyone explain?


[05/18/2021 6:10 PM] MarlKarx#3791
I looked at Nexus Mutual because the Cover page on Yearn is indecipherable to me


[05/18/2021 6:13 PM] 0xSLH#0662
If this was a recurring error instead of a one time bug, wonder how much of the yvBOOST discount it explains.


[05/18/2021 8:07 PM] Fistodoom#0846

[05/18/2021 8:09 PM] vany#0365
its a known issue with zapper. recommendation is to deposit into the curve pool then deposit the pool token into the vault


[05/18/2021 8:19 PM] MarlKarx#3791
newb question..looking at zapper.fi why is the USD value of my usdc deposit to the vault so much lower? its like $400 difference. Not talking about the amount of yusd tokens received, I'm talking about the apparent USD value of the usdc


[05/18/2021 8:22 PM] MarlKarx#3791
I know stablecoins fluctuate slightly but it's like a full 1%


[05/18/2021 8:40 PM] BugsBunny#3770
Have asked this in CREAM discord with no luck. Folks here are a lot more responsive, so wanted to try my luck: I supplied Dai, YFI, and Sushi to Iron Bank, but my Borrow limit is only being applied to Dai supply. I turned "on" collateral for YFI and Sushi and still has not changed.


[05/18/2021 8:40 PM] BugsBunny#3770
CREAM docs say YFI and Sushi collateral factors should be 60% and 70%, respectively. Am I missing something?


[05/18/2021 8:56 PM] vany#0365
sometimes $ calc can be off, you can always take vault tokens and multiply by pricepershare to find out your total USDC. <https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f18C75AbDAe578b483E5F43f12a39cF75b973a9#readContract>


[05/19/2021 12:56 AM] ONI#6888
1. Yes earn moves the coins to the protocol with the best lending rates at the time. y.curve.fi moves all the coins at once, busd can move partial amounts (some in aave some in dydx for example)
2. Yes smart contract risk, protoocol risk where the funds are being lent out too. 
3. no andre cannot rug Earn its controlled by the multisig afaik


[05/19/2021 1:13 AM] unk045#6843
Thanks for responding @ONI. Noob question I imagine on my part, but how does the smart contract risk and protocol risk translate to me? I’m not sure what exactly all that means in this context.


[05/19/2021 1:13 AM] ONI#6888
smart contract risk of yearn yEarn contract being able to be exploited


[05/19/2021 1:13 AM] ONI#6888
protocol risk is really that protocols smart contract risk of being able to be exploited


[05/19/2021 1:14 AM] ONI#6888
so if yEarn v2 y.curve.fi lends too aave for yield, then do you trust aave's systems/contracts?


[05/19/2021 1:14 AM] ONI#6888
ect


[05/19/2021 1:14 AM] ONI#6888
having said that generally we view yEarn as the safest of our products as it has been working the longest.


[05/19/2021 1:15 AM] ONI#6888
Also yEarn has no fees


[05/19/2021 1:15 AM] ONI#6888
but generally our yVaults earn more in APY but have more risks


[05/19/2021 1:16 AM] ONI#6888
they farm/lend/use up to 7 (for now) protocols at once to earn yields


[05/19/2021 1:17 AM] ONI#6888
but they can have up to 20 strategies and new ones are being added every day to our vaults


[05/19/2021 1:17 AM] ONI#6888
so it is really what level of risk you are comfortable with.


[05/19/2021 1:17 AM] ONI#6888
for yEarn you could also get insurance for whichever protocol yEarn is lending if that make you feel safe or against yearn itself as well.


[05/19/2021 1:18 AM] unk045#6843
Theoretically is it possible for the money deposited in yEarn to disappear?


[05/19/2021 1:18 AM] ONI#6888
I would look over this for how risks related to products, this is written for just YFI though


[05/19/2021 1:18 AM] ONI#6888
https://gov.yearn.finance/t/what-can-you-do-with-yfi/10622


[05/19/2021 1:19 AM] ONI#6888
not really sure what your asking here... but that wouldnt be its intended function. Not sure how you are supposing funds would 'disappear'.


[05/19/2021 1:20 AM] unk045#6843
I mean losing the funds you deposit


[05/19/2021 1:20 AM] ONI#6888
In general putting funds in smart contracts is risky, you have to trust they are doing and working how they were designed too.


[05/19/2021 1:21 AM] ONI#6888
If its working as intended nope. It just lends out funds


[05/19/2021 1:21 AM] ONI#6888
if the people cannot pay back their interest on aave/dydx then they get liquidated and you get your funds back


[05/19/2021 1:22 AM] ONI#6888
and again, as I said yEarn has been working fine for over a year, I think it is, and is yearn first product.


[05/19/2021 1:22 AM] ONI#6888
it is also the simplest product at yearn


[05/19/2021 1:23 AM] ONI#6888
That isnt to say, that I think the vaults are unsafe, I dont, and I personally use them alot.


[05/19/2021 1:24 AM] unk045#6843
Right...thanks for all that. As you can tell, most of the disconnect here is stemming from my lack of understanding of some of the basic concepts as it relates to the risk, exploits, smart contracts, etc


[05/19/2021 1:24 AM] ONI#6888
you can think of yEarn as just directing its pool of funds to the highest lender, and yVaults as actively managed DeFi farming for your funds, where you just sit back and relax, while earning the highest possible risk-adjusted yield.


[05/19/2021 1:24 AM] unk045#6843

Am I depositing my USDC here?  https://v1.yearn.finance/earn


[05/19/2021 1:28 AM] ONI#6888
You can deposit any coins you want that show up there


[05/19/2021 1:28 AM] unk045#6843
But this is v1 with lower yield correct?


[05/19/2021 1:28 AM] ONI#6888
no


[05/19/2021 1:28 AM] ONI#6888
this is yEarn


[05/19/2021 1:29 AM] ONI#6888
it generally has lower yield than yVaults yes


[05/19/2021 1:31 AM] unk045#6843
If you look here, v2 USDC is showing a higher yield than v1 USDC https://yearn.finance/vaults

[05/19/2021 3:08 AM] ONI#6888
these are not related to earn


[05/19/2021 3:09 AM] ONI#6888
v1.yearn.finance is the old yearn.finance website. It has nothing to do with v1 yVaults and v2 yVaults.


[05/19/2021 3:09 AM] ONI#6888
v1.yearn.finance is the only place you can access our yEarn product at


[05/19/2021 3:10 AM] ONI#6888
I would not recommend depositing to any v1 yVaults as they will soon all be upgraded to v2


[05/19/2021 3:16 AM] unk045#6843
So products on v1.yearn.finance will become obsolete?


[05/19/2021 3:16 AM] ONI#6888

[05/19/2021 3:23 AM] unk045#6843
Since it’s a USDC pool with that v2 vault, would you say the risk is just as high as the other pools?

I really cannot explain more than I have above on the risks, you need to do your own research on where each yProduct is lending its money and see if your are comfortable with that. I cannot and should not convince you to use or not use our products. That is ultimately up to you, but I have given you everything you need to make an informed decision.

Hello I see that on the web site: It says I can migrate all or withdrawl all. What is the cost of migration ? (Do I pay the 0.5% fees of V1 )? What is the cost of withdrawal ? (Do I pay the 0.5 fees of V1 ?) Thank you in advance for your answer.

Thank you for your link. However it is not clear. UST vault is in the process of migration. So My question is , if I widthdraw (without doing migration), will I pay the 0.5 fees ?

Hello, I am trying to withdraw some crvUSDP denominated to DAI, and I see in Etherscan the transaction has been long completed, however I do not see the changes on yearn.finance reflect that (I still see original amount of crvUSDP)


[05/19/2021 8:49 AM] dxa1#1189
maybe try to have a look in curve (where you could maybe widthdraw to dai) or zapper (to display your wallet content)


[05/19/2021 8:53 AM] trooper#8542
zapper says it's still in crvUSDP. When you say "look in curve", how do I do that? Sorry, I'm quite a noob here

I appreciate all your insight @ONI. Yes, I understand that I need to make my own decision at the end of the day, but there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle it seems, some of which are not very clear on the surface...to me at least. My understanding was that vaults are a bit riskier compared to earn so I thought going with the USDC option maybe a 'safer' approach because it's a stablecoin but that doesn't appear to be the case based on the article you sent highlighting v2 USDC yVault


[05/19/2021 11:33 AM] unk045#6843
v2 USDC yVault approach seems to basically be like all the other vaults, hence the higher reward is my understanding compared to earn


[05/19/2021 1:34 PM] MarlKarx#3791
how safe are the Vaults during these periods of extreme volatility? feeling spooked from how much chaos is going on in general...can this whole operation weather this?


[05/19/2021 1:39 PM] arberx#3367
No issues with the vaults


[05/19/2021 1:39 PM] arberx#3367
Very safe


[05/19/2021 1:40 PM] arberx#3367
Collateral ratios always kept in check. Probably one of the safest places to be besides in fiat, or simple lending

Any guidance on why a zap out of a v1 vault fails?  I just spent $3,500 to get this error: Fail with error 'Error Swapping Tokens 1' - it would be great to know how/if I could have detected this would occur in advance.


[05/19/2021 2:22 PM] sudbury#6239
The error is raised here: (contract: 0xc5b49abf8b164472be9486767af6b1a5586b5609)
        (bool success, ) = _swapTarget.call.value(valueToSend)(swapCallData);
        require(success, "Error Swapping Tokens 1");


[05/19/2021 2:31 PM] ONI#6888
In general since gas is so high I would wait to send any transactions on eth until gas is lower to save on fees


[05/19/2021 2:33 PM] ONI#6888
I think its probably slippage on the trade went too high due to volatility in the market, but im not sure

Hello, I initiated a transaction into a vault yesterday for DIA and YFI. It charged me the ETH but did not seem to do anything else.


[05/19/2021 3:00 PM] ONI#6888
that was probably just the approve transactions. All vaults have 2 steps: approve, and deposit


[05/19/2021 3:00 PM] ONI#6888
I would try to deposit again into the vault when gas is cheaper. See gasnow.org for gas estimates, usually under 70 gwei is decent


[05/19/2021 3:27 PM] dcretul#5826
I hit deposit and saw a small pop up saying it was processing, and that it had processed.


[05/19/2021 3:28 PM] dcretul#5826
For the YFI one it took about a minute but I did see that it processed the deposit on the small pop up once it completed.


[05/19/2021 3:34 PM] sudbury#6239
Yes - that's the same error - other than "don't do stuff when gas is high" - is there any viable way to tell if this will fail in advance?  It's doesn't appear to be a gas error - maybe check all the swap pools that will be hit?


[05/19/2021 3:37 PM] kx9x#3778
(bool success, ) = _swapTarget.call.value(valueToSend)(swapCallData);


[05/19/2021 3:37 PM] kx9x#3778
there is no good way to really accurately determine the expected gas cost of a an arbitrary call like this


[05/19/2021 3:37 PM] kx9x#3778
but if it wasn't an out of gas error, then it was something going wrong in zapper's zap


[05/19/2021 3:38 PM] kx9x#3778
and I think you'd have to talk with them to figure that one out


[05/19/2021 3:51 PM] BugsBunny#3770
hello - following up on this. CREAM guys looked into it and it seems to be a front-end UI issue as my correct borrowing limit is showing in their API. He said he would reach out to the Yearn team. Just wanted to see if this could be looked at. A couple others on CREAM discord raised the same issue


[05/19/2021 4:59 PM] DOZΞ#4287
Quick question about the crvLINK vault. I'm curious if there's a certain price level Chainlink would need to fall down to, that would cause a liquidation event on the vault? If there's some info about this published already, I'd appreciate it if someone could point me int he right direction. I've spent a lot of time looking for the answer and couldn't find anything definitive.


[05/19/2021 5:00 PM] DOZΞ#4287
I did read something about the crvLINK vault could be at risk of having the tokens frozen. But I'm not sure what parameters would cause the vault to freeze, and what implications that would have on the depositors.. if we could eventually get our tokens back or if they're just gone forever.


[05/19/2021 5:00 PM] DOZΞ#4287
I realize there's always a risk of contract exploits. But outside of an event like that, I'm wondering what risks the crvLINK vault is exposed to.


[05/19/2021 5:35 PM] kx9x#3778
crvLink... liquidations?


[05/19/2021 5:35 PM] kx9x#3778
the yearn vault doesn't do any borrowing


[05/19/2021 5:35 PM] kx9x#3778
for crvLink


[05/19/2021 5:36 PM] kx9x#3778
your crvLink is staked on curve via the yearn vault and the crv gov token is sold for more crvLink


[05/19/2021 5:36 PM] kx9x#3778
crv strats are very battle tested at yearn and the most common strat


[05/19/2021 5:37 PM] kx9x#3778
risks involve the link/slink pool on curve getting fucked up if sLink has a bug or something


[05/19/2021 5:38 PM] kx9x#3778
is sLink loses peg to Link, then the pool could get unbalanced, which means 1 crvLink could suddenly be like 0.05 link and 0.95 sLink and then you are stuck with sLinks that lost peg due to a bug or issue


[05/19/2021 5:38 PM] kx9x#3778
that's probably the biggest outside risk


[05/19/2021 5:38 PM] kx9x#3778
I don't know enough about synthetix to know how sLink works and what the chances are that it loses peg to Link

Hi, I'm trying to withdraw some crvUSDP from my existing deposit on yearn but the "Withdraw" button does nothing. What am I missing?


[05/19/2021 7:16 PM] trooper#8542
or does withdrawing crvUSDP -> DAI not work and I need to withdraw into crvUSDP  first?


[05/19/2021 7:21 PM] vany#0365
there has been issues with zapper and their zaps out of vaults, recommended solution is to do it manually. vault -> withdraw crvUSDP -> go to curve.fi and withdraw dai from USDP pool.

[05/20/2021 2:17 AM] ONI#6888
Quick update, no funds were lost but there was an accounting error that caused price per share to drop by 10%. we have disabled deposits and withdraws to allow devs time to fix this accounting error back to normal.

I mean the vault says this "We have taken steps to increase the safety factor on our strategies that have LTV ratios that must be maintained. In the process of doing this, an accounting issue was uncovered with artifical losses reported that drove down the price of the yvWETH vault significantly. We are taking actions to resolve this accounting error and return the vault to normal. Please do not withdraw until the issue has been patched, as you currently will receive WETH at the artificially lowered share price of ~0.90."

yearn vaults can be a bit of a black box and the ability to zap in from other tokens doesn't really show you the price impacts


[05/20/2021 12:47 PM] vany#0365
Zaps just automate what you would normally do. Sell token -> deposit into vault. If the current market price was super low then it would sell, zaps don’t know vETH2 should be 1:1 they just look at uniswap pool price and sell


[05/20/2021 12:58 PM] kx9x#3778
are.... you sure about that one ser?

humm did u get rugged?


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] kx9x#3778
definitely not 1:1 to eth


[05/20/2021 12:59 PM] kx9x#3778
let me double check though, that might be an incentive token


[05/20/2021 1:00 PM] kx9x#3778

aight, I see now


[05/20/2021 1:03 PM] zeekay#9999
so not quite 1:1, but the yearn zap was more like 1:99

unstake gives you sgt


[05/20/2021 1:04 PM] kx9x#3778
and withdraw gives you the eth back


[05/20/2021 1:05 PM] kx9x#3778
however, it looks like you just sold for a steeeep discount:

[05/20/2021 1:05 PM] kx9x#3778
what slippage did you use for the zap?


[05/20/2021 1:06 PM] zeekay#9999
I did from the yearn UI, so the default


[05/20/2021 1:10 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, so zapper has no clue that this token is worth 1 to 1 to ETH. zapper just sells on the open market, since this pool is super low liquidity


[05/20/2021 1:10 PM] kx9x#3778
you accepted a really crappy price


[05/20/2021 1:10 PM] kx9x#3778
pool only had $300 of liquidity when you swapped


[05/20/2021 1:10 PM] kx9x#3778
after the zapper logic for the swap, the yearn logic seems correct


[05/20/2021 1:10 PM] kx9x#3778
but the big issue is that zapper let you go through a pool with basically no liquidity


[05/20/2021 1:11 PM] zeekay#9999
Alright, well I had no idea I was accepting that price since the UI didn't show me that at all

someone nabbed your eth right after


[05/20/2021 1:14 PM] zeekay#9999
Ya I undestand. I tihnk the Zap functionality in the yearn UI is a bit problematic in this case, since there is no way to check the price impact of what's being zapped


[05/20/2021 1:15 PM] zeekay#9999
at least on zapper directly, it would have shown me that price impact, slippage, etc. but the yearn zap UI really does not allow you to see any of that


[05/20/2021 1:16 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, I agree and the tx you sign just shows hex data


[05/20/2021 1:16 PM] kx9x#3778
so it isn't very easy to actually see what you are signing


[05/20/2021 1:18 PM] zeekay#9999
exactly. in the zapper UI directly, my vEth2 was showing as 1:1 eth as expected, so i went to yearn ui to zap in, and had no idea it was going to go through such a low liquidity pool


[05/20/2021 1:21 PM] ONI#6888
afaik yearn uses the same zap, so same thing would have happened there as well pretty sure


[05/20/2021 1:23 PM] zeekay#9999
The difference is on zapper i would have been able to see that


[05/20/2021 1:24 PM] zeekay#9999
Not showing users what's happening in the tx is what rekt me here

Do they not reflect the share price?


[05/20/2021 9:39 PM] vany#0365
zapper shows your vault token balance


[05/20/2021 9:40 PM] vany#0365
so your eth would be zapper balance * 1.010937


[05/20/2021 9:40 PM] vany#0365
your zapper balance would not have changed as you still own the same number of shares, just the value of the shares


[05/20/2021 9:40 PM] gwenace#4655
I show my zapper balance in ETH


[05/20/2021 9:41 PM] gwenace#4655
And that number seems off


[05/20/2021 9:41 PM] gwenace#4655
I think it may be a zapper fi issue tho


[05/20/2021 9:41 PM] vany#0365
im not in that vault so i cant check sorry


[05/20/2021 9:41 PM] gwenace#4655
If I withdraw or deposit from yearn front end would I be transacting at the share price?


[05/20/2021 9:41 PM] vany#0365
yes, as you can see on yearn.vision share price is back to normal

is there a way to see how much yveCRV you would get if you redeemed yvBoost?


[05/21/2021 12:39 AM] unk045#6843
Trust wallet shows for v1 Yearn Finance. I'm not seeing it on the new Yearn Finance though (v2). Is it not available?


[05/21/2021 12:40 AM] ONI#6888
if you go to yearn.finance it should show you a number under deposited, that is how much of the deposit token you now would have on withdrawal.


[05/21/2021 12:46 AM] Lee and Hester#5963
My yvboost is currently in the lp. Is there a way to see what the ratio is yvboost/yvecrv?

so 1 yveCRV = 1.017118109601533250 yvBoost


[05/21/2021 1:45 AM] ONI#6888
or another way to look at it, is from the start of the vault it has made 1.7% returns


[05/21/2021 1:52 AM] LONO#3863
experiencing a strange issue when I use metamask on yearn today. It's supposedly connecting to my wallet, but it shows public address all lowercase instead of the proper wallet address (with upper and lowercase letters). And so it doesn't show my funds. When I connect through wallet  connect, it isn't all lower-case and connects just fine. Using a ledger.

thank you.


[05/21/2021 2:19 AM] Lee and Hester#5963
Thank you for this. Though you mean the other way around though right? 1 yvboost =1.01711... yvecrv?


[05/21/2021 2:21 AM] Lee and Hester#5963
Thank you. So in an efficient market the price of market yvecrv should be price according to that  share price?


[05/21/2021 2:21 AM] ONI#6888
ah yes this is correct


[05/21/2021 2:24 AM] ONI#6888
Possibly? But at times it trades somewhat below crv to veCRV


[05/21/2021 2:24 AM] ONI#6888
for now I think if you want yvBoost it is generally better to buy it from the sushi pool than to deposit into the vault


[05/21/2021 2:26 AM] Lee and Hester#5963
It’s been hard to get my head around what is influencing the price of those three coins.  Crv, yvecrv, and yvboost.  That don’t seem to move with eth and sometimes they don’t move the same in relation to each other


[05/21/2021 2:29 AM] ONI#6888
I think you should mostly watch the price ratio of CRV to yveCRV


[05/21/2021 2:29 AM] ONI#6888
I wouldnt watch it in relation to eth or usd, that is determined by crv to usd generally


[05/21/2021 2:29 AM] ONI#6888
basically crv and yveCRV should track relatively closely


[05/21/2021 2:30 AM] ONI#6888
but at times yveCRV has traded at a 20% or 30% discount to CRV. At these times its always better to buy the vault token from sushi swap either yveCRV or yveBoost than deposit crv into the vaults


[05/21/2021 2:38 AM] Lee and Hester#5963
Thanks for the info


[05/21/2021 6:49 AM] cusegrl#9897
New here (and new to crypto in general 👶🏻)  and trying to send funds into a vault . . .I have had money sitting in a regular bank account and I made $0.68 in “interest” in about a year so I said eff it and decided to invest in crypto. I have a Coinbase wallet but I can’t seem to figure out how to zap in funds, use Curv . . .again this is all completely new to me so any help would be greatly appreciated Thanks!


[05/21/2021 6:49 AM] ONI#6888
Do you have enough eth in your coinbase wallet for gas?


[05/21/2021 6:49 AM] ONI#6888
Also which vault are you wanting to deposit into?


[05/21/2021 6:50 AM] cusegrl#9897
The boost ETH vault . . .how much gas do I need?


[05/21/2021 6:51 AM] ONI#6888
30-70$ in eth probably


[05/21/2021 6:51 AM] ONI#6888
depending on gas prices


[05/21/2021 6:52 AM] cusegrl#9897
Honestly I have no clue what I’m doing but want to eventually pay off my car loan if I can and I owe over $100,000 in student loans so getting out of debt is my main goal here


[05/21/2021 6:53 AM] ONI#6888
Currently the zap for yvBoost is disabled so you cannot zap into it.


[05/21/2021 6:53 AM] cusegrl#9897
Ah ok . . .


[05/21/2021 6:54 AM] ONI#6888
You can enter a base v2 vault like usdc, eth, or dai, or choose a curve v2 vault.


[05/21/2021 6:54 AM] ONI#6888
all those offer zaps so you can swap most crypto into the vault

I’m like straight outta the womb with this crypto


[05/21/2021 6:57 AM] ONI#6888
But right now the curve vaults have the highest yield, but the base vaults (non-crv) have the most strategies, but for now a lower yield.


[05/21/2021 6:58 AM] ONI#6888
Also a note that generally in defi you want to invest more than 1k or 5k as anything lower than that and the deposit and withdrawal fees can cut into yield quite a bit, especially if you make transactions when gas fees (denominated in `gwei`) are high


[05/21/2021 6:58 AM] ONI#6888
You can see current gas prices by visiting gasnow.org


[05/21/2021 6:58 AM] ONI#6888
current gas is at 45 gwei which is very cheap


[05/21/2021 6:59 AM] ONI#6888
but yes yearn's Vaults and Earn products are good for making yield on your money and not having to worry about it


[05/21/2021 7:01 AM] cusegrl#9897
Yea I put like 5k into Coinbase mostly ETH took a stutter with that dip the other day but it rebounded


[05/21/2021 7:01 AM] ONI#6888
yah so you could deposit eth into the eth v2 vault and earn yield on it


[05/21/2021 7:02 AM] cusegrl#9897
👍🏻


[05/21/2021 7:02 AM] ONI#6888
the yield on eth isnt super high but our strategists are always looking and improving the ways that vault (all vaults actually) gets yield

Hello! Question about yvecrv: In order to be able to claim the weekly 3crv, can I do that by buying yvecrv from the yvecrv-eth pool? Or do I only qualify by depositing crv?


[05/21/2021 10:40 AM] j.#6352
Yes. You can buy it. As long as you have yvecrv in your wallet, you'll be able to claim 3crv


[05/21/2021 10:43 AM] saltydog#0420
Perfect thank you

[05/21/2021 9:05 PM] HAtTip3675#6478
You need to do 2 transactions one to approve and then you can deposit


[05/21/2021 9:10 PM] cusegrl#9897
Yea someone is literally walking me through it cause I have to do it manually or something


[05/21/2021 10:30 PM] cusegrl#9897
Ok my USDC is now gone

and swap it to ETH?


[05/22/2021 5:48 AM] j.#6352
You can zap out on Zapper.fi or Zerion.io directly to ETH. You can also do it manually by withdrawing your LP from Sushiswap then swapping yveCRV for ETH

[05/22/2021 1:15 PM] Jcrypto69#3561
hello frens, I am wanting to participate in the backscratcher vault and provide liquidity on sushi for yvecrv-eth, would it make more sense to go thru the process of locking my crv for vecrv, then getting yvecrv and migrating to L2 on polygon to provide liquidity on sushi? 

or should I sell my crv for eth then just buy yvecrv on sushiswap? Will the affect my airdrop rewards for eps? or am I not entitled to them if I will be providing liquidity? 

Any help would be appreciated:)


[05/22/2021 1:16 PM] ONI#6888
best to buy via sushi for now


[05/22/2021 1:16 PM] ONI#6888
once you have yvBoost its treated like all other vault tokens and would get the boost from all veCRV airdrops if/when they are added to the yveCRV vault


[05/22/2021 1:17 PM] Jcrypto69#3561
what is yvboost?


[05/22/2021 1:17 PM] Jcrypto69#3561

[05/23/2021 4:10 AM] ONI#6888
also you can see how insurance relates to vaults on the YFI vault


[05/23/2021 4:10 AM] ONI#6888
of course the dai vault will interact with different protocols than the YFI vault so you would have to check that


[05/23/2021 4:14 AM] ONI#6888
yes claims have been successfully paid out


[05/23/2021 4:14 AM] ONI#6888
but the difference now is, I believe, you need to show proof of loss of funds


[05/23/2021 4:14 AM] ONI#6888
whereas previously you did not.


[05/23/2021 4:15 AM] ONI#6888
so in the previous yDAI vault incident yearn reimbursed users who lost funds, **and** nexus paid out insurance claims


[05/23/2021 4:15 AM] ONI#6888
now nexus will not pay out if the protocol reimburses users


[05/23/2021 4:16 AM] ONI#6888
basically if you have insurance, and something happens to a yearn vault, due to a bug in yearn's smart contracts, you can file a claim for losses with nexus and they will decided if they want to pay out to make you whole, or not.


[05/23/2021 4:17 AM] ONI#6888
if you want to read about the DAI vault incident all security incident reports are in our yearn security github repository

Hi, I must be missing something because I cannot figure out how to withdraw


[05/23/2021 8:55 PM] LT#6349
I deposited a small amount of ETH as a test and now I don't see how to withdraw it


[05/23/2021 8:59 PM] arberx#3367
yearn.finance?


[05/23/2021 8:59 PM] arberx#3367
It doesn't show up?


[05/23/2021 8:59 PM] LT#6349
I go to the vault page, connect my wallet, find the ETH vault, and it says I have a vault balance of .1001 eth


[05/23/2021 8:59 PM] arberx#3367
Yep, click 100% and withdraw


[05/23/2021 9:00 PM] LT#6349

[05/23/2021 9:03 PM] LT#6349
So maybe I'm reading it wrong but that says I'm going to spend $12 to send 0 ETH?


[05/23/2021 9:03 PM] arberx#3367
Looks right, 0 ETH because you're not sending any eth


[05/23/2021 9:03 PM] LT#6349
Oh


[05/23/2021 9:03 PM] LT#6349
And then another transaction will trigger to send me the balance?


[05/23/2021 9:03 PM] arberx#3367
No that is the transaction


[05/23/2021 9:04 PM] arberx#3367
Try it, you'll get the eth back


[05/23/2021 9:05 PM] LT#6349
Ok, it actually shows the same balance under weth


[05/23/2021 9:05 PM] LT#6349
So I assume once I withdraw the eth the weth will be gone, too


[05/23/2021 9:05 PM] LT#6349
Another thing I'd like to understand


[05/23/2021 9:05 PM] LT#6349
All I did was deposit into that vault


[05/23/2021 9:06 PM] LT#6349
And the balance is the same as it was a couple of weeks ago when I deposited


[05/23/2021 9:06 PM] LT#6349
Should I have done something differently or is that just not enough ETH to earn anything?


[05/23/2021 9:06 PM] arberx#3367
Check it out on yearn.fi


[05/23/2021 9:06 PM] arberx#3367
Eth vault was only yielding like 4%


[05/23/2021 9:07 PM] arberx#3367
Might not make a big difference since it's also a small amount (relatively)


[05/23/2021 9:07 PM] LT#6349
Ah

[05/24/2021 7:53 AM] 0xfarmer#5374
so... the dumbest of dumb questions but spent 20 mins looking and can't find the answer

is the YFI token worthless (as originally stated) or is there now a tokenomic in which YFI holders receive rewards from the ecosystem, like CRV, AAVE etc? 🙏


[05/24/2021 8:57 AM] ONI#6888
YFI holders do currently receive anything for holding. no. But the protocol has a treasury that is governed by YFI


[05/24/2021 8:58 AM] ONI#6888
This changed with YIP: 56 Buyback and Build https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-56-buyback-and-build/8929 previously you could stake your YFI into a contract and earn protocol fees, but that was taken away in favor of building up the treasury with YFI.

[05/24/2021 2:01 PM] twosevenkid#8806
this happens for both ETH and SNX vaults


[05/24/2021 2:12 PM] vany#0365
For eth “max” means you would run out of eth. Not sure on SNX vault. Could be a rounding error on deposit


[05/24/2021 2:37 PM] JeromeDavid 🇺🇸#6410
Good news.  I could not deposit SNX to the vault using my desktop computer using the Chrome browser for some reason.  But I was able to deposit it using my IPhone.   Thanks for you help.

[05/25/2021 10:09 AM] kx9x#3778
v1 isn't supported very well anymore, so it might be broken. Are you sure you deposited into the v1 eth vault? also, why do that over the v2 eth vault?


[05/25/2021 10:36 AM] TikiApe#9154

we'd like everyone to just go to v2 directly


[05/25/2021 11:02 AM] kx9x#3778
that way you don't need to migrate and save some gas


[05/25/2021 11:39 AM] TikiApe#9154
I clicked on the "Invest>Earn" dropdown on V2 which automtically pulled me to the V1 screen.  First time user, Chrome on Mac.


[05/25/2021 11:42 AM] TikiApe#9154
Then I deposited to "Vaults" on that V1 screen.


[05/25/2021 11:46 AM] kx9x#3778
ahhhh, I see


[05/25/2021 11:46 AM] kx9x#3778
I see how that could unintentionally lead users to the v1 vaults


[05/25/2021 11:51 AM] TikiApe#9154
If you need a button to take V2 users to V1 it probably should be a SINGLE path button witht the necessary disclaimers, not multiple paths.

agreed


[05/25/2021 12:37 PM] SimonSays#0670
Apologies for asking this in multiple places (also put it in general, but havent gotten any replies): Question on the yearn lending platform at https://v1.yearn.finance/lending. I've deposited a bit of a supply asset (left-hand column), and activated the "collateral" button. However, I can't figure out how to borrow anything. I can't change the %s on the limit slider at the top of t he right-hand column, nor can I enter an amount to borrow for any of the assets on that side of the ledger. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? Thanks!


[05/25/2021 12:38 PM] ONI#6888
which asset?


[05/25/2021 12:42 PM] SimonSays#0670
WBTC


[05/25/2021 12:42 PM] ONI#6888
you should be able to borrow up to 80% in other assets

Refreshed often but your balance will only change when a harvest for the vault strategies occur

Got you - every ~500k usd right?


[05/25/2021 7:49 PM] vany#0365
Really depends on the strategy and costs to call harvest

[05/25/2021 11:59 PM] arberx#3367
Then go to sushi, unstake


[05/25/2021 11:59 PM] arberx#3367

[05/26/2021 12:00 AM] arberx#3367
Given the amount you have though, I suggest you stay in until gas gets cheaper


[05/26/2021 12:07 AM] vany#0365
V2 vaults in general have been audited. Don’t think specific vaults or strats have, they are peer reviewed


[05/26/2021 12:16 AM] Merkyah#1940
I have unstaked I believe... 
I selected "Harvest and Exit" and now I am here

Hello, I'm trying to withdraw from the crvAAVE vault
I'm connected via metamask
When I click the Withdraw Button,  it doesn't pop up the metamask window for confirmation


[05/26/2021 7:39 AM] mobydoby#1359
Nevermind, it's because I had USDC selected


[05/26/2021 7:39 AM] mobydoby#1359

Hi there is Zap function not working for crvstETH vault?


[05/26/2021 9:15 AM] Makseem#2731
Hey when i put some crypto into a vault do i need to wait for 1 year to get them back ?


[05/26/2021 9:15 AM] Makseem#2731
@ me


[05/26/2021 9:50 AM] arberx#3367
No


[05/26/2021 9:50 AM] arberx#3367
You can withdraw anytime


[05/26/2021 9:50 AM] arberx#3367
Where’d you hear that?


[05/26/2021 10:11 AM] Makseem#2731
I thought because of APY, the y means year right ?


[05/26/2021 10:12 AM] Makseem#2731
And for exemple if the apy is 10% (and stable) but i only left my crypto in the vault for 6 month, what return would i get ?


[05/26/2021 10:21 AM] arberx#3367
Yes, apy is yearly


[05/26/2021 10:22 AM] arberx#3367
6 months would be 5%


[05/26/2021 10:26 AM] MabeeHP#8809
I use https://yearn.fi/invest to see the status of my vault holdings.  I used to see at the top of the page my Portfolio Balance, Yearly Growth, and Highest Balance.  For some reason in the past few days I stopped getting those figures at the top of the screen.  When I hit F5 to refresh it looks like those fields are going to be populated but when it finishes refreshing all I see are category yield leaders.  I must of changed some setting accidentally.  How can I get back to seeing Portfolio Balance, Yearly Growth, and Highest Balance?


[05/26/2021 10:49 AM] Anton#9785
@Unknown Hey bud. Refresh on yearn.fi/invest again now please.
The balances should load.


[05/26/2021 11:19 AM] MabeeHP#8809
You fixed it!  Thanks


[05/26/2021 11:29 AM] MabeeHP#8809
The portfolio balance now displays but seems to show the sum of the vault units rather than their value.  I believe before it showed their value in USD.


[05/26/2021 12:22 PM] chang#0695
hi! i had a question about the 20% management fees - that would theoretically be taken from the % growth listed for each vault right? so if i were getting 10% yearly growth, on withdraw i'd receive 8%?


[05/26/2021 12:33 PM] sdtsui#6239
Yes, I have the same question.

I think the management fee is 2% of total AUM, not 20% as asked above.   My question is: when are those fees taken? It says once a year.  So do 2% of my LP tokens get claimed at the _end_ of the year (thus my profits from them still compound before the end of that year?). 

What happens if I stop after 6 months, is 1% taken at the end of those 1 months?  That's 1% of all funds, so both principal and any profits, correct?


[05/26/2021 12:34 PM] sdtsui#6239
Re: the 20% performance fee (who I think the above asker is asking about), would also like to know when that is taken.


[05/26/2021 12:34 PM] chang#0695
thanks @Unknown , yeah i mixed up the terminology, i meant the performance fee


[05/26/2021 12:34 PM] sdtsui#6239
yeah the docs could be more clear, hard to estimate your return right now as they're written


[05/26/2021 12:35 PM] sdtsui#6239
if the performance fee is taken on each harvest i think that will limit compounding (which is one of the main reasons to use yearn).   if it's taken on withdraw (as @Unknown is asking, receiving 8% after 10% growth), it's a bit better


[05/26/2021 12:57 PM] uhdissls#5773
Hello. Can someone explaine please how can i mafrate from COMP v1 to COMP v2?
I don't have any migration bottom


[05/26/2021 1:32 PM] therealleejo#8825
Since migrating to V2 vaults I'm struggling to see how to easily see their value. Zapper.FI sees the account but the value doesn't update, and the new interface just shows the invested coins. How can I see the vault's value in USD as was displayed in the V1 dashboard? Thanks.


[05/26/2021 1:39 PM] arberx#3367
yearn.fi or trackavault


[05/26/2021 1:39 PM] arberx#3367
#🔗links


[05/26/2021 1:45 PM] therealleejo#8825
Thanks for the yearn.fi link. Unfortunately, it seems to have a bug - it's dlsplaying the tokens invested as USD. For example, if I have 10 WETH tokens in a vault it's showing the portfolio value as "$10.00"


[05/26/2021 2:02 PM] mister#8731
Hey dudes, appreciate the warning about the yWETH vault -- theres a typo in your warning message though just a heads up

what’s the difference between yvboost and yvboost - eth? Why is the second one so much higher than the first one?


[05/26/2021 10:18 PM] enbrighten#5687
Thanks Arberx! I’m new to buying crypto and after purchasing  a small amount of YFI into my exchange account, I accidentally sent the amount to Yearns contract address instead of my hard wallet when I tried to do the transfer (I was setting up a few contract addresses into my wallet and mistakenly pasted the wrong address into the withdrawal account). I have proof of the mistake transaction and just wanted to check if there is any possibility of retrieving this amount back to my exchange account from Yearn. If anyone knows, I would greatly appreciate it, thanks!


[05/26/2021 10:34 PM] kbhouse#5117
Hi support team, I deposited into the crvSTETH vault. When I withdraw, it gives me the option to do so in various currencies. Is there a way to see what exchange rate I can get if I were to withdraw in ETH?

Thanks.

I am trying to deposit into the crvSTETH vault on yearn V2. I got my eth and just deposited it into Curve giving me steCRV. I am trying to deposit this into the yearn vault. However, when I try to it appears as tho yearn can't see my crvSTETH balance as when I click max it says Na in the deposit part of the UI. I am pretty sure my wallet is connected. Any ideas on what the problem could be?


[05/27/2021 11:58 AM] j.#6352
Did you click "Deposit" or "Deposit and Stake in Gauge" on Curve?


[05/27/2021 11:59 AM] j.#6352
you'll have to unstake if you did


[05/27/2021 11:59 AM] HENF#4572
I clicked "deposit"


[05/27/2021 11:59 AM] j.#6352
can you confirm in etherscan that the curve pool token is in your address?


[05/27/2021 12:00 PM] j.#6352
or that Curve shows your balance deposited?


[05/27/2021 12:02 PM] j.#6352

[05/27/2021 12:03 PM] j.#6352
i dont have anything to suggest other than when i experience that on yearn's ui, i either forget that i havent connected metamask or i have to do a hard refresh by pressing ctrl+shift+r


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] HENF#4572
Using a ledger if that may be the problem?


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] j.#6352
or, that aside, i usually just find it in zapper or zerion. i do most yearn vault interactions on those anyway


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] HENF#4572
thanks for your time


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] j.#6352
are you connecting your ledger through metamask?


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] j.#6352
or directly from ledger?


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] HENF#4572
no


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] j.#6352
ok that may be the problem


[05/27/2021 12:04 PM] HENF#4572
directly through ledger


[05/27/2021 12:05 PM] j.#6352
there have been reports from other users with the same experience


[05/27/2021 12:05 PM] HENF#4572
ah ok I'll try that thx


[05/27/2021 12:05 PM] j.#6352
connect your ledger through metamask


[05/27/2021 12:07 PM] HENF#4572

After posting here yesterday I had a couple people reach  out to me supposedly from "support" to try to "help" me and was told to enter my wallet passphrase into a site.  Is there a way to stop these people from trying to steal?


[05/27/2021 12:55 PM] j.#6352
theres a bot that instabans people based on some actions and we can only manually ban scammers that users report, usually on #🚨report-spam


[05/27/2021 12:56 PM] j.#6352
people from the team wont message you ever unless explicitly asked, but most of the time it's the user who's asked to message an admin for safety

Did you read above? its your cache


[05/27/2021 1:48 PM] ONI#6888
try incognito mode or clear your cache and try cntl+shift+r

if that doesnt work try it on zapper.fi

I will try zapper.fi next


[05/27/2021 1:56 PM] ONI#6888
hard refresh


[05/27/2021 1:56 PM] ONI#6888
try zapper.fi that should work


[05/27/2021 2:02 PM] garywolf#9690
I am trying to figure out how to do it over there on zapper.fi. Any good tutorial?


[05/27/2021 2:07 PM] garywolf#9690
I only see the steth curve, not the yearn vault


[05/27/2021 2:19 PM] garywolf#9690
I found, the search feature in zapper.fi is really bad you have browse through all the pages to find something


[05/27/2021 2:36 PM] Javalasers#8212
possibly silly question, but I know that with some vaulting/staking products the ERC20 token doesn't hermetically represent the entire position... if I want to move my crvSTETH vault position from one wallet (A) to another (B), can I simply transfer the yvCurve-stETH ERC20 token from A to B?


[05/27/2021 2:46 PM] saltydog#0420
For the yvecrv that I have in my wallet, can I keep the 3crv unclaimed for a while? Or do I have to claim every week?


[05/27/2021 2:57 PM] j.#6352
yes you can claim whenever you want


[05/27/2021 2:57 PM] j.#6352
yes

[05/28/2021 6:30 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Check in etherscan your address, you need to send two transactions: one approve and another is the deposit call

Hi team, looking to zap into yveBOOST, but no option coming up. Using PC, firefox, metamask. Worked before some weeks ago


[05/28/2021 7:48 PM] Mr Bones#6942
Hey folks, quick normie question. Once I deposit into a yVault that's all I need to do to earn the % growth right?


[05/28/2021 7:50 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
I know there have been some problems with the zap integrating related with the APIs, might be that


[05/28/2021 7:50 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes, if you have the yvtokens in your account you're done


[05/28/2021 7:52 PM] Mr Bones#6942
cool thnx


[05/29/2021 9:31 AM] Vlad123#5854
Hello, do you maintain exposure to deposited coins while they are in yearn?


[05/29/2021 9:33 AM] j.#6352
of course. theyre yours


[05/29/2021 10:03 AM] Vlad123#5854
If you deposit eth, earn interest, then cash out in eth...do you maintain appreciation of your eth? Similar to celsius?


[05/29/2021 10:04 AM] ONI#6888
For which vault?


[05/29/2021 10:04 AM] ONI#6888
if you deposit to the eth vault yes


[05/29/2021 10:04 AM] Vlad123#5854
But not for example the crv vault?


[05/29/2021 10:05 AM] Vlad123#5854
If you zap in with eth


[05/29/2021 10:08 AM] Benjahsana#8607
Am I reading it correctly that you get SUSD as a reward from vaulting SNX?


[05/29/2021 10:09 AM] ONI#6888
no you dont you get all rewards as the vaults deposit token


[05/29/2021 10:10 AM] ONI#6888
for a crv eth vault you will the deposit token


[05/29/2021 10:11 AM] Vlad123#5854
What is a better strategy, waiting for coins to appreciate or farming yield?


[05/29/2021 10:15 AM] ONI#6888
in the eth vault you can do both


[05/29/2021 10:15 AM] ONI#6888
or the crvSTETH/crvSETH


[05/29/2021 10:18 AM] Vlad123#5854
Some vaults show very high APY, does that drift down over time?


[05/29/2021 10:28 AM] ONI#6888
It can


[05/29/2021 12:06 PM] vany#0365
Zap means it will sell whatever coin you are using for the vault token. So if you send eth for the 3crv vault then you are selling your eth for stables and earning more stable coins. You would no longer have an eth position


[05/29/2021 1:07 PM] Vlad123#5854
Is there a vault in which I maintain my eth position?


[05/29/2021 1:09 PM] ONI#6888
any of the eth vaults


[05/29/2021 1:09 PM] ONI#6888
eth, weth and crvSETH


[05/29/2021 1:10 PM] ONI#6888
crvSTETH includes eth 2.0 staked eth, so not really the same but up to you if you want to use that vault was well.


[05/29/2021 1:12 PM] Vlad123#5854
What about yvBoost-Eth


[05/29/2021 1:26 PM] vany#0365
That is a 50-50 position in yvboost and eth


[05/29/2021 1:27 PM] vany#0365
Also subject to impermanent loss


[05/29/2021 1:29 PM] Vlad123#5854
Is there a site that shows APY overtime for various vaults?


[05/29/2021 1:32 PM] Vlad123#5854
Ah, so if you use an eth vault and maintain your position in eth you are subject to impermanent loss - only stables are without impermanent loss, I think I'm getting it, lol.


[05/29/2021 1:35 PM] vany#0365
No that’s just the coin losing value in USD. Yearn farms focus on getting you more of the token you deposited, not YSD growth. Impermanent loss is regarding AMM’s


[05/29/2021 1:36 PM] vany#0365
Yvboost-eth is not a typical vault for yearn. It’s part of our backscratcher program


[05/29/2021 1:36 PM] ONI#6888
yvBoost-ETH isnt a yearn vault its a pickle jar/farm


[05/29/2021 1:37 PM] ONI#6888
it is an LP position as @vany is saying. Very different than a yearn vault which takes a single crypto/stablecoin as its deposit token


[05/29/2021 1:37 PM] ONI#6888

its not a vault its a zap into pickles jar which you then need to stake into their farm

I put into the SNX Vault 5 days ago and there has been 0 increase.  It's been a while since I first put something into a vault, but is that normal to wait that long?


[05/31/2021 8:35 AM] SprühwurstDeluxe#7067
Should be normal, as SNX staking rewards can only be harvested once a week, IIRC.


[05/31/2021 8:52 AM] ONI#6888
The vault share price will increase not your amount of tokens. Best to track it on trackavault.com


[05/31/2021 9:19 AM] asuhdude#2775
Yeah I use Zapper mostly, but also checked Trackavault.  But checking yearn it typically updates as it rewards.  But a weekly reward for SNX makes sense, I’ll patiently wait 😅

[06/01/2021 4:33 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
Hi @ONI sorry to bother but would really appreciate it if you can help answer this. Seems like USDT and DAI vaults are already v2 but I still have some in v1. Is the 0.5% of principal withdrawal fee waived for these two or it's too late...


[06/01/2021 4:35 AM] ONI#6888
no there shouldnt be a withdrawal fee as of now afaik


[06/01/2021 4:35 AM] ONI#6888
do you see the banner for migrating on yearn.finance?


[06/01/2021 4:38 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
we are an institutional user of Yearn(depositing to Yearn for our users) so I dont use the website...


[06/01/2021 4:38 AM] ONI#6888
I see


[06/01/2021 4:38 AM] ONI#6888
yes you can migrate there is no withdrawal fee now


[06/01/2021 4:39 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
cool cool, so I guess we will withdraw all funds from v1 and immediately followed by depositing all to v2. Does that sound reasonable


[06/01/2021 4:42 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
also do you know how long that waive will last? it may take a few days for me to get all things prepared and then execute, dont want to miss the window

should be for a while

for the "crvLUSD" v2 vault I'm only able to withdraw as crvLUSD - whenever I choose something else nothing happens
for different vaults everything is fine

sorry if i just did something wrong


[06/01/2021 5:21 AM] ONI#6888
on yearn.finance try cntl+shift+r


[06/01/2021 5:44 AM] Japocalypsis#9794
Hi, guys! 
This was my first experience with Yearn, and I put my usdt for earn v1, the amount appeared on my portfolio balance. But in an hour it became less than what I've put in there. I thought it's supposed to grow your portfolio not waste it? or am I doing something wrong?


[06/01/2021 5:48 AM] Raven#4299
already tryed that - wasn't working for me


[06/01/2021 6:14 AM] ONI#6888
could be the zap isnt working right now ill check on that


[06/01/2021 6:15 AM] ONI#6888
its probably just not showing accurately where were you checking your balance?


[06/01/2021 6:15 AM] Japocalypsis#9794
now it seems to go back to my initial deposit. Is it always this weird? 
also, is there anyway to send my deposit from v1 to v2 without withdrawing?


[06/01/2021 6:15 AM] ONI#6888
the portfolio view on v1.yearn.finance might now be accurate


[06/01/2021 6:15 AM] Japocalypsis#9794
oh, okay. Thank you


[06/01/2021 7:45 AM] ONI#6888
@Unknown asking about this I dont think dai and usdc vaults are migrating yet


[06/01/2021 7:45 AM] ONI#6888
best to wait on this one if possible


[06/01/2021 10:28 AM] BoydyGunz#6038
Hi I am trying to withdraw my Eth from one of the vaults but every time I click confirm transaction on my MetaMask I am being charged and my Eth is not returning to my MetaMask...please help?


[06/01/2021 11:13 AM] BoydyGunz#6038
Anyone able to help?


[06/01/2021 11:33 AM] ONI#6888
it will give you weth


[06/01/2021 11:33 AM] ONI#6888
did you check if you have weth?


[06/01/2021 11:53 AM] BoydyGunz#6038
I tried both


[06/01/2021 11:53 AM] BoydyGunz#6038
I tried withdrawing Weth & Eth


[06/01/2021 11:54 AM] BoydyGunz#6038
I initially locked in Eth so shouldn’t I be able to withdraw Eth?


[06/01/2021 11:56 AM] ONI#6888
sorry I mean if you withdrawal from either vault it will give you weth


[06/01/2021 11:56 AM] ONI#6888
if you sent a withdrawal transaction and you dm it too me and I will look at it


[06/01/2021 2:44 PM] Japocalypsis#9794
sorry for disturbing you, but is usdt earn is able to migrate to v2 vault?


[06/01/2021 2:44 PM] Japocalypsis#9794
v1 earn give slightly above 1% of apy while v2 vault give over 8%


[06/01/2021 2:51 PM] vany#0365
yearn is different from vaults so there is no "migration" but you can withdraw from earn and deposit into the vault if you would like


[06/01/2021 2:52 PM] Japocalypsis#9794
yeah, that what I was afraid of. Extra gas fees to be paid 😩


[06/01/2021 2:53 PM] vany#0365
the zap would still do the same steps as you would do manually. the only extra expense should be 1 additional token approval. at these gas prices that should be under $10


[06/01/2021 2:53 PM] Japocalypsis#9794
okay, thank you for clarifying it


[06/01/2021 2:58 PM] Cyclo#5919
Hello chaps. I'd like ot zap into yvBOOST but can't seem to do so. Is this a known bug?


[06/01/2021 4:27 PM] sgtsKill#0001
i believe it was temporarily disabled? note it may be cheaper to buy the token

@ONI  Sorry for my delay mate -- my problem is with the AlUSD vault


[06/01/2021 4:30 PM] anActualHuman#5043
The problem is still occuring today and after I tried ctrl+shift+r


[06/01/2021 4:30 PM] anActualHuman#5043
Seems like I'm not the only one


[06/01/2021 4:32 PM] anActualHuman#5043

Hello, not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I have a question about the yvBOOST-ETH offering.  What does yearn do here apart from executing the zap in?


[06/01/2021 7:24 PM] Wallace Yan#0757
oh interesting, but I dont see V1 vaults on the site https://yearn.finance/vaults anymore, thought that means it's encouraged to do the migration. So if not now, any idea when the withdraw fee will be waived so we can proceed?


[06/01/2021 8:30 PM] vany#0365
You can see the fee for the vault by hovering over v1. If it has a migration button, fee should be waived


[06/01/2021 9:20 PM] Wallace Yan#0757
thanks for the reply, the issue is that we are an institutional user(using Yearn via API) so we don't use the page hence can't see if there is migration button or not.


[06/01/2021 9:35 PM] vany#0365
Which vault is it?


[06/01/2021 10:02 PM] Wallace Yan#0757
We use USDT v1 vault and DAI v1 vault


[06/02/2021 12:32 AM] ONI#6888
All v1 vaults of which you do not have assets in via the connected wallet are hidden by default


[06/02/2021 12:33 AM] ONI#6888
We don't want people depositing to v1 when it will have to been moved to v2 very soon and will stop earning them yield


[06/02/2021 12:34 AM] ONI#6888
We have just finished all crv v1 to v2 migrations and will start on all other non-crv v1 vault migrations now. There will be an announcement when these pools move


[06/02/2021 12:52 AM] adrienne#6075
I am also still having this same issue from a few days ago with crvEURS. Any idea on when it will be resolved? @ONI


[06/02/2021 1:50 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
totally make sense


[06/02/2021 1:51 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
any high level rough estimation on the moving date? so we can be prepared


[06/02/2021 1:54 AM] ONI#6888
should be this month probably within 2 weeks


[06/02/2021 3:18 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
cool cool, just to double confirm, if we manually withdraw now there is likely a 0.5% one-time withdrawal fee, but if we wait until the migration starts, the withdraw fee will be waived?


[06/02/2021 3:18 AM] ONI#6888
yes that is correct


[06/02/2021 3:19 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
thanks! where the announcement will be posted? in the announcement channel?


[06/02/2021 3:19 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[06/02/2021 3:19 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
perfect, thanks, will keep an eye on that


[06/02/2021 3:33 AM] vany#0365
will be posted on twitter and our #📣announcements channel

I want to long CRV and understand I can do that by depositing into the yvBoost (https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d409a0A012CFbA9B15F6D4B36Ac57A46966Ab9a) vault. I understand that this would be a way to long CRV since the underlying yveCRV that are compounded trade in alignment with veCRV and CRV. Is that right?

[06/02/2021 4:35 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
My alternatives would be to simply buy CRV and stake for veCRV or stake in CVX for cvxCRV, right? And the latter doesn't auto-compound and I like that Yearn does, so that's why one would opt for yvBoost?


[06/02/2021 4:35 AM] ONI#6888
yes that is correct


[06/02/2021 4:36 AM] ONI#6888
yvBoost gives you compounding 3crv rewards in the form of more yveCRV


[06/02/2021 4:37 AM] ONI#6888
https://crv.ape.tax/ the yveCRV vault is now getting 77.9% more weekly rewards than if you staked your crv with curve.fi


[06/02/2021 4:42 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Got it! Thank you. Any place where I can track how the pricing of yvBOOST <> CRV has performed over time?


[06/02/2021 4:43 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
I assume that since it holds yveCRV that it is arbed to parity via people using the yvBOOST/ETH SLP, is that right?


[06/02/2021 4:43 AM] ONI#6888
Not sure on this...


[06/02/2021 4:43 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Trying to establish how reliable of a 1:1 long it is, if that makes sense


[06/02/2021 4:44 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
yvBoost to CRV


[06/02/2021 4:44 AM] ONI#6888
I dont think its at parity now, but it has been at times

1CRV:1.2YVBOOST via this route


[06/02/2021 4:45 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
via Sushi SLP I think


[06/02/2021 4:46 AM] Elite Dev#1156
Hi there,
I had looked thru this project and found that interesting.
So we are gonna integrate it to our platform.
We have lots of funds(ERC-20 tokens) in our projects which is deposited by the users and we wanna do staking & rewards with your platform(especially yVaults).
But you know we are pretty new with your platform so don't know well exactly.
-YVaults contracts support testnet ?
-What is the reward token? yToken or something?
-How we can make interaction between our smart contract and yVaults?

Looking forward to your reply,
Thanks


[06/02/2021 4:47 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Oh this is interesting, if you import the yvBoost address (0x9d409a0A012CFbA9B15F6D4B36Ac57A46966Ab9a) into Paraswap (https://paraswap.io/#/?network=ethereum) it'll show you historical pricing @ONI

yah 1inch has a good chart too


[06/02/2021 4:50 AM] ONI#6888
yah so it trades at a 20% discount so if you deposit crv into the vault you will get 20% less than if you bought, currently. Best to buy yvBoost by selling crv into eth for now, but this changes over time.


[06/02/2021 4:56 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Seeing the same thing. CRV price increase hasn't been reflected in the yvBOOST price yet. Doesn't that mean that if you were to zap in via a stable (say Dai or USDC) that you'd actually be buying vault shares at a 20% discount vs. the fair value that's going to be reflected eventually?

[06/02/2021 4:57 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
e.g. $10.000 USDC to yvBoost via a zap (probably going via the yvBoost/ETH SLP) would acquire 5315.48 yvBOOST tokens vs. what would otherwise buy 4397.56 CRV tokens


[06/02/2021 4:58 AM] ONI#6888
We reward in fee sharing, not in YFI. If you want to partner with yearn in some way I would fill out the forum and we will reach out to you.


[06/02/2021 4:58 AM] ONI#6888
the zap for yvboost is disabled but when it is reactivated yes that will be the case


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
On the main UI you mean?


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
If one uses Paraswap or Matcha wouldn't you achieve the same thing?


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] ONI#6888
for now the zap sells your asset buys crv and deposits it to the vault


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] ONI#6888
yes, I would use them for now


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Okay awesome you're the best


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
So what's the reason for the discount though?


[06/02/2021 4:59 AM] ONI#6888
humm


[06/02/2021 5:00 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
People just not arbing it away yet?


[06/02/2021 5:00 AM] ONI#6888
well there is no real arb right


[06/02/2021 5:00 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Maybe not possible since you cannot unstake though


[06/02/2021 5:00 AM] ONI#6888
becuase you cannot withdrawal crv


[06/02/2021 5:00 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
right... so what's the corrective mechanism for the price?


[06/02/2021 5:00 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
more demand for yvBoost in the SLP because the rewards are higher vs. the principal?


[06/02/2021 5:01 AM] ONI#6888
none that I know of execpt sooner or later people will find it a good price vs crv


[06/02/2021 5:01 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
e.g. if you buy $1000 yvBOOST you get 1.2x more tokens so effectively more 3CRV rewards per $ collateral


[06/02/2021 5:01 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
that's probably right


[06/02/2021 5:01 AM] ONI#6888
1.78x


[06/02/2021 5:02 AM] ONI#6888
so you get alot more rewards


[06/02/2021 5:02 AM] ONI#6888
as shown here https://crv.ape.tax/


[06/02/2021 5:02 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Right. But is that a function of the combined CRV triggering more proportional rewards per CRV


[06/02/2021 5:02 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Or also factoring in the discount?


[06/02/2021 5:02 AM] ONI#6888
uh no


[06/02/2021 5:02 AM] ONI#6888
that isnt compounding


[06/02/2021 5:03 AM] ONI#6888
that is simply yearn giving yveCRV vault holders its weekly 3crv


[06/02/2021 5:03 AM] ONI#6888
so yearn locks up 10% of all crv farmed via vaults into the yveCRV vault for all yearn vaults' boost


[06/02/2021 5:04 AM] ONI#6888
and yearn the protocol doesnt claim its 3crv rewards but gives it to the yveCRV vault holders to boost their returns


[06/02/2021 5:04 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Amplifying the reward of CRV put into yvBOOST vs. staking in CRV


[06/02/2021 5:04 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
I get it


[06/02/2021 5:04 AM] ONI#6888
so the difference in weekly 3crv rewards vs staking at curve.fi is 1.78x


[06/02/2021 5:04 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
But it's not additionally factoring in the discount


[06/02/2021 5:04 AM] ONI#6888
so that is just the yveCRV vault


[06/02/2021 5:04 AM] ONI#6888
then we have yvBoost


[06/02/2021 5:05 AM] ONI#6888
which claims those weekly rewards into more yveCRV for you


[06/02/2021 5:05 AM] ONI#6888
so yvBoost is compounded weekly 3crv rewards from yveCRV vault


[06/02/2021 5:05 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Right right


[06/02/2021 5:05 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
But the discount seems to be the cherry on top

{Reactions}
👍 

[06/02/2021 5:06 AM] ONI#6888
yes none of this is related to what the market is trading yvecrv or yvboost for


[06/02/2021 5:06 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Meaningfully impacts rewards though since the APY is compounding the principal


[06/02/2021 5:06 AM] ONI#6888
so imo under .8 or buying for a 20% discount to parity or even lower is a great deal


[06/02/2021 5:06 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
If I enter $1000 into CRV for 1x CRV and 1x rewards vs. entering $1000 into yvBOOST at 1.2x yvBoost and 1.78x rewards, then there's another multiplier


[06/02/2021 5:07 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
am I understanding that correctly?


[06/02/2021 5:07 AM] ONI#6888
ah I see


[06/02/2021 5:07 AM] ONI#6888
this is only if you sell your crv or 1000$ in whatever and buy yvboost from the market then yes


[06/02/2021 5:08 AM] ONI#6888
you would get it at a 20% discount


[06/02/2021 5:08 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Yeah like I mean the following


[06/02/2021 5:08 AM] ONI#6888
then get the 1.78x weekly rewards


[06/02/2021 5:08 AM] ONI#6888
if instead you took 1k and bought crv and deposited


[06/02/2021 5:08 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Say I'm looking to allocate $10K in USDC, it buys me 4409.87 CRV atm, or 5321.59 yvBoost


[06/02/2021 5:08 AM] ONI#6888
you would have 800$ worth of yvboost


[06/02/2021 5:10 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Right so CRV trades at a premium and yvBoost at a discount, so as long as I'm not swapping into it via CRV but going: whatever > yvBOOST (via SLP) then I purchase at a discount


[06/02/2021 5:10 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Appreciate you walking through this with me


[06/02/2021 5:10 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
You're a trooper @ONI


[06/02/2021 5:10 AM] ONI#6888
no not swapping but depositing into the vaults


[06/02/2021 5:10 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Yes yes! That's right.


[06/02/2021 5:10 AM] ONI#6888
you can also swap crv via matcha for a discount too


[06/02/2021 5:11 AM] ONI#6888
yes


[06/02/2021 5:11 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
How does the swap work though? I understand it uses the SLP but what is the mechanic? Say I want to go USDC > yvBOOST, the Paraswap routing doesn't show me an intermediary token.


[06/02/2021 5:11 AM] ONI#6888
all aggragators will route through sushi anyways its the only pool haha


[06/02/2021 5:11 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
It just allows me to buy the one-sided yvBOOST from the pool, changing the pool balance right?


[06/02/2021 5:11 AM] ONI#6888
or the most volume


[06/02/2021 5:11 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
so I'm not touching anything other than the yvBoost with my purchasing asset

sushi: usdc > weth > yvboost


[06/02/2021 5:13 AM] ONI#6888
uh yah thats how a amm works?


[06/02/2021 5:14 AM] ONI#6888
you start with asset a and no matter what you need eth to buy yvBoost as its a yvboost eth pool


[06/02/2021 5:14 AM] ONI#6888
so sell a for eth via best route, then sell eth for yvboost


[06/02/2021 5:15 AM] ONI#6888
also note that I prefer matcha over 1inch they just have historical graphs atm


[06/02/2021 5:15 AM] ONI#6888
matcha gives you positive slippage, 1inch takes it from you


[06/02/2021 5:17 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Great to know!


[06/02/2021 5:17 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
And thanks for that AMM breakdown.


[06/02/2021 5:17 AM] ONI#6888
np


[06/02/2021 5:24 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Oh 1 more thing: why is the Zap into the vault halted?


[06/02/2021 5:24 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Technical issues or another more fundamental reason?


[06/02/2021 5:24 AM] ONI#6888
Because it needs to be optimized


[06/02/2021 5:25 AM] ONI#6888
the vaults are working fine


[06/02/2021 5:27 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Okay, ty


[06/02/2021 5:27 AM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913

[06/02/2021 5:47 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
hey @ONI I do have a question on fees on v2 vaults:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734811808401063966/849569963856363550/unknown.png


[06/02/2021 5:49 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
this management fee, it's annualized 2%? So it means if I keep funds in v2 vault for a year, then I am paying 2% on my principal, which basically means if the vault APY is 10%, then in reality I am getting 8% (10%-2%) interest rate?


[06/02/2021 5:52 AM] ONI#6888
yes that is true. It is annualized, but no the rates shown under growth are all after fees


[06/02/2021 5:52 AM] ONI#6888
so this 2% annual fee is already accounted for


[06/02/2021 5:53 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
oh nice, didn't know, thanks!


[06/02/2021 5:53 AM] ONI#6888
yep so its more like the vault is showing its making 10%


[06/02/2021 5:53 AM] ONI#6888
but its really making like 14% or 15% before fees


[06/02/2021 5:53 AM] ONI#6888
it actually shows you net and growth on our site if you hover over the fees section


[06/02/2021 5:57 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
yep, see a gross APY and net APY


[06/02/2021 5:57 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
beautiful, thanks!

I am a complete newbie to yearn here. I just deposited a small amount of ETH into the ETH vault and see I have WETH but haven't received any interest for a couple days now. Am I doing something wrong?

[06/02/2021 10:49 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I had a question about withdrawing funds from a vault...I have been running into trouble


[06/02/2021 10:50 AM] arberx#3367
You can ask here


[06/02/2021 10:50 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
Thank you!


[06/02/2021 10:51 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I deposited 2 ETH into the V2 ETH vault. At that point 2 wETH were utomatically created.


[06/02/2021 10:52 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I went to withdraw an ETH, and there is my first question. I'm able to withdraw ETH and wETH, but they are basically the same


[06/02/2021 10:54 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
So I withdrew an ETH, but I ended up with wETH in my wallet. So I went to Uniswap to exchange the wETH for regular ETH. Many many transaction fees later, I was unsuccessful. Fortunately I was able to redeposit the wETH back into the /yearn V2 vault.


[06/02/2021 10:54 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
So now I'm afraid to try and withdraw anything. Can you help me?


[06/02/2021 10:56 AM] arberx#3367
You tried to swap weth for eth?


[06/02/2021 10:56 AM] arberx#3367
That should have worked


[06/02/2021 10:56 AM] arberx#3367
You probably did something wrong


[06/02/2021 10:56 AM] ONI#6888
for eth weth swaps use weth.io


[06/02/2021 10:56 AM] ONI#6888
not an amm


[06/02/2021 10:56 AM] arberx#3367
Should still work though right?


[06/02/2021 10:56 AM] ONI#6888
the eth/weth vault will always give you weth


[06/02/2021 10:57 AM] ONI#6888
it will work but could give you a bad rate


[06/02/2021 10:58 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
Yes. there is a way to "unlock" a wETH at uniswap, and there's a way to "permanently unlock". Very confusing to me. 😦 Anyway I ended up in a loop on my ledger where I kept approving and approving, like 12 times, still nothing but fees.


[06/02/2021 10:58 AM] ONI#6888
odd yah you dont need to use uniswap for yearn things


[06/02/2021 10:59 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
So when withdrawing from the ETH vault, does it matter whether you withdraw the ETH or the wETH?


[06/02/2021 10:59 AM] ONI#6888
no


[06/02/2021 10:59 AM] ONI#6888
it all gives you weth


[06/02/2021 10:59 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
Oh...


[06/02/2021 11:00 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
When depositing, the wETH is automagically created from ETH, but when withdrawing it's not the same?


[06/02/2021 11:00 AM] ONI#6888
yes that is correct


[06/02/2021 11:01 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
So I need to learn the unwrapping procedure, which I think takes several transactions...


[06/02/2021 11:01 AM] ONI#6888
no it takes one


[06/02/2021 11:01 AM] ONI#6888
possibly 2 at most check out weth.io


[06/02/2021 11:01 AM] ONI#6888
make sure to set gas properly and not change it via metamask/ledger but in the settings they give you there


[06/02/2021 11:02 AM] ONI#6888
as per what they say


[06/02/2021 11:02 AM] ONI#6888
use gasnow.org for gas pricing


[06/02/2021 11:02 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
there's an approval required before the unwrapping step?


[06/02/2021 11:02 AM] ONI#6888
not sure I dont believe so


[06/02/2021 11:02 AM] ONI#6888
but could be


[06/02/2021 11:02 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
OK, thanks for those links!


[06/02/2021 11:03 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I think I tried changelly too and was unsuccessful.


[06/02/2021 11:03 AM] ONI#6888
yah dont use them or I wouldn't. If you need help with something pls ask here first


[06/02/2021 11:04 AM] Pasta747#2749

Hello, I'm having some trouble withdrawing my crvEURS to USDC from the v2 vault. I just completed the "approve" transaction, but when I click withdraw nothing happens.


[06/02/2021 11:05 AM] ONI#6888
humm that is true ill let them know


[06/02/2021 11:06 AM] ONI#6888
I dont believe the zap is working currently I would try on zapper.fi


[06/02/2021 11:08 AM] ONI#6888
if that still doesnt work while upping the slippage I would just do it manually


[06/02/2021 11:36 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
Hello again. I've been looking at the links provided me by ONI. I have not withdrawn anything from the vault yet. When I go to https://relay.radar.tech/, it pops up 2.2 WETH, and I haven't connected a wallet yet.

hum just connect you wallet then see


[06/02/2021 11:38 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
That 2.2 WETH is what I was having trouble with and ended up depositing back into the vault. IT appears to be marked somehow...how did that value pop up before I connected a wallet?


[06/02/2021 11:38 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
And how could I swap it when it's still in a vault?


[06/02/2021 11:38 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I'm trying to proceed with caution here. 🙂


[06/02/2021 11:42 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
OK I connected Ledger and values updated...will try withdrawing from vault now


[06/02/2021 11:43 AM] astratrader#5351
Now that my eursCRV is withdrawn, do you know where I would be able to trade it for USDC? I can't find anything on metamask, SUSHI or Curve...


[06/02/2021 11:43 AM] ONI#6888
use zapper.fi to see you balances


[06/02/2021 11:47 AM] ONI#6888
ok use ledger through metamask


[06/02/2021 11:47 AM] ONI#6888
it works best that way


[06/02/2021 11:48 AM] ONI#6888
sure try https://matcha.xyz/ or https://1inch.exchange/


[06/02/2021 11:50 AM] ONI#6888 (pinned)
its set to this because we have a 50% curve lockup on this vault so we waive all other fees


[06/02/2021 11:52 AM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
You recommend using Ledger through Metamask rather than Ledger alone? (I have noticed that Ledger alone does have connectivity problems on different sites for some reason.)


[06/02/2021 11:54 AM] astratrader#5351
It appears that there's no liquidity anywhere for eursCRV. Does that sound right?


[06/02/2021 11:56 AM] ONI#6888
yes it works better


[06/02/2021 11:56 AM] ONI#6888
oh


[06/02/2021 11:56 AM] ONI#6888
you need to withdrawal from curve first

you can withdrawal to EURs or sEUR then swap that to something else


[06/02/2021 12:01 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
ouch I had 4.2 ETH in a vault. I withdrew 2.2. Instead of the result being 2 ETH in the vault and 2.2 in my Ledger, I have zero in both.


[06/02/2021 12:02 PM] ONI#6888
can you dm me your address?


[06/02/2021 12:03 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
Yes, please stand by


[06/02/2021 12:05 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
What happens when metamask is open in different tabs of a browser, does that cause trouble?

Hello again. How to convert CRV to yveCRV so that I can try out the yvBOOST vault?


[06/02/2021 2:41 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
yvBOOST won't let me deposit CRV directly. And I have no luck with ZAP.


[06/02/2021 2:42 PM] ONI#6888
the zap is disabled for now


[06/02/2021 2:42 PM] ONI#6888
I would recommend you swap crv for yvboost via https://matcha.xyz/

[06/02/2021 3:00 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
OMG haha I'm not getting it.


[06/02/2021 3:01 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I approved something...
Approve CRV spend limit


[06/02/2021 3:01 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
So now another transaction to actually do the swap?


[06/02/2021 3:03 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
And once I swap to yvBOOST, how does that turn in to yveCURV?


[06/02/2021 3:04 PM] ONI#6888
yes


[06/02/2021 3:04 PM] ONI#6888
no yvBoost is better yveCRV


[06/02/2021 3:05 PM] ONI#6888
the normal flow is crv deposit into yveCRV which you can deposit into yvBoost


[06/02/2021 3:05 PM] ONI#6888
yveCRV gives you boosted weekly rewards on staked CRV


[06/02/2021 3:05 PM] ONI#6888
while yvBoost gives you auto compounding weekly rewards from yveCRV


[06/02/2021 3:05 PM] ONI#6888
so you dont have to claim your 3crv weekly rewards if you are in yvBoost it will do that for you.


[06/02/2021 3:15 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
OK my vault balance is now: 1210.6464 yveCRV and I don't even know how it got deposited. I swapped CRV for yvBOOST at Matcha. I never deposited anything at yearn. I never bought yveCRV.


[06/02/2021 3:17 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I might have to take up a hobby, like drinking.


[06/02/2021 3:26 PM] ONI#6888
yah yveCRV is the deposit token for yvBoost


[06/02/2021 3:26 PM] ONI#6888
its saying you have yvBoost


[06/02/2021 3:26 PM] ONI#6888
and if you withdrew you would get that much yveCRV


[06/02/2021 3:27 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
How did it deposit itself?


[06/02/2021 3:28 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
I was reading another forum here and it seems I'm not the only one having trouble grokking the situation. 😕


[06/02/2021 3:43 PM] ONI#6888
it didnt you just bought the vault token from the market because it was 20% cheaper than depositing


[06/02/2021 3:46 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
OK, I bought it, but it never showed up in Ledger and now it shows as being in a vault. I don't know how it shows deposited when I never deposited it, I only swapped for it.


[06/02/2021 3:49 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
If anyone buys yvBOOST does it go into a yearn vault automatically, even if they've never visited Yearn?


[06/02/2021 3:49 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
Sorry if I sound as obtuse as I feel...


[06/02/2021 3:51 PM] vany#0365
basically someone deposited into yvboost and sold you their shares, so you now own their shares in the vault even without depositing


[06/02/2021 3:56 PM] ThisNameWasntTaken#3576
Wow. I'm going to let this sink in if possible. BTW I only got a 10% discount when I bought, perhaps the market is evening things out.


[06/02/2021 4:14 PM] vany#0365
whenever crv moons there is a few hours where the spread gets big, i bought a bunch with my idle crv yesterday at 18% discount. so already up 8% in crv


[06/02/2021 4:47 PM] Upstategirl#4282
Can I transfer my USDC into the yearn LUSD curve pool? Also is it worth staking on pickle?


[06/02/2021 4:51 PM] Upstategirl#4282
I currently have funds in the yearn USDC vault but want to move liquidity to another pool for better yields . . .thoughts on whether the PUSD or LUSD is better option


[06/02/2021 4:59 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Depends on your confidence in Liquity and LUSD holding its peg. It's a different risk profile than USDC. Less conventionally centralized.

[06/02/2021 5:02 PM] Upstategirl#4282
Oh ok . . .I can’t decide between the USDP or the LUSD 🤔 I’m kinda a noob and I already have funds in the yvBoost/ETH and staked on pickle so I’m leaning towards the LUSD but not sure so I wanted to see if anyone here had thoughts to help me decide


[06/02/2021 5:05 PM] heroo#0072
I’ll recommend LUSD over PUSD

Is it best to just stake n gauge in curve or in pickle? I didn’t realize until I joined another discord that pickle seemed kinda controversial for some die hard yfi peeps

Personally I use curve 😊

Is zapper functioning to deposit funds of USDC or can I only deposit crvLUSD?


[06/02/2021 9:40 PM] twel.ch#6835
any reason to do this over pickle.finance ?

@here I am trying to deposit my USDC into the USDC V2 vault. My transaction was approved however I never received the yvUSDC tokens. Post approved transaction, my USDC remained in my wallet. 

Why is this not working?


[06/02/2021 9:51 PM] arberx#3367
Two transactions


[06/02/2021 9:51 PM] arberx#3367
One approve, one to deposit


[06/02/2021 9:52 PM] arberx#3367
This is how all erc20 transactions work


[06/02/2021 9:55 PM] Tarius#8419
So I hit deposit on the yearn page and then my metamask prompts me to execute the transaction. I hit confirm (I use high gas to make it faster) and then nothing happens. Am I missing something?


[06/02/2021 9:59 PM] arberx#3367
There are two transactions again


[06/02/2021 9:59 PM] arberx#3367
One approval, one deposit


[06/02/2021 10:00 PM] arberx#3367
Make sure to actually specify an amount to deposit


[06/02/2021 10:05 PM] Tarius#8419
I did that and it led me to my current situation. I hit the max button for all my USDC to be put into the vault. Then confirmed the transaction and nothing happened. 👀


[06/02/2021 10:05 PM] Tarius#8419
Where does the second transaction come in?


[06/03/2021 12:59 AM] Tarius#8419
Turns out I had to disconnect the site from my metamask wallet and resync it. The transaction has finally gone through!


[06/03/2021 2:10 AM] ONI#6888
Very nice!


[06/03/2021 2:11 AM] ONI#6888
Yes don't use that zap there is a reason it is disabled


[06/03/2021 9:35 AM] Stefan#6148
I have noticed the yield on the v1 DAI+USDC+USDT vaults is on the decline. What would be the best procedure for me to migrate to the v2 vaults? Manually withdraw and deposit, or wait for an "official" migration path?


[06/03/2021 1:53 PM] Grace_Slim#6621
Yeah this just worked for me as well


[06/03/2021 3:52 PM] ONI#6888
We will announce when the withdrawal fee is waived and when we are ready for users to migrate


[06/03/2021 4:04 PM] anActualHuman#5043
Our problem withdrawing is still not even acknowledged as far as I can tell here


[06/03/2021 4:04 PM] anActualHuman#5043
Anyone from the team going to update us on why we can't withdraw from the vault into USDC or anything besides the vault tokens? Thank you 🙂


[06/03/2021 4:05 PM] anActualHuman#5043
Still doesn't work on Zapper even with 3% slippage set...


[06/03/2021 4:07 PM] anActualHuman#5043
I guess I could withdraw to CrvAlUSD tokens and then go to Curve and exchange them for USDC but I'd love an answer on what's going on


[06/03/2021 4:08 PM] ONI#6888
your talking about crvEURS vault?


[06/03/2021 4:08 PM] ONI#6888
and trying to zap out?

There were a handful of failed withdraws on the sUSD yVault earlier today. What caused them to fail? https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5cA62D95D24A4a350983D5B8ac4EB8638887396

I'm also curious why the web app shows $9M in assets for the vault and the contract shows $143K


[06/03/2021 5:10 PM] ONI#6888
which vault?


[06/03/2021 5:10 PM] ONI#6888
sUSD?


[06/03/2021 5:10 PM] ONI#6888
oh the 143k is assets not in strategies


[06/03/2021 7:36 PM] mike.sylphdapps.eth#8012
Ahh and the totalAssets function returns the value that's shown on the web app

[06/03/2021 8:55 PM] anActualHuman#5043
talking about crvAlUSD vault and trying to zap out into USDC or DAI or ETH or even USDT. I do not have issues with zapping into non-vault-tokens with the other vaults I am in.

Thanks mate


[06/03/2021 9:32 PM] Victor-#2890
Hey all, fairly new to De-Fi here so go easy on me haha. 

I just deposited $32K USDC to the crvUSDN vault via the Zap feature, but the total USDN amount in the vault now is 30,800 USDN…Gas fee was $50.

Where did I go wrong lol? Anyone got any idea on what happened? Just wanna get smarter about this stuff and avoid issues like this in the future!

Appreciate any and all answers!


[06/03/2021 9:46 PM] vany#0365
that sounds about right. the coins you get back represent share of the vault, which appreciates due to the APY the vault earns. if you were to withdraw now it would be basically the same amount you deposited (zapping could have had minor slippage)


[06/03/2021 9:49 PM] Victor-#2890
Oh really ?! Nice! I thought about withdrawing and seeing if that would be the case but I just didn’t wanna get hit with more gas fees lol. Appreciate you taking the time to help out!


[06/03/2021 9:51 PM] vany#0365
no problem. you can check out sites like trackavault in #🔗links to see your $ value. should also be pretty close to the vaule

I made a withdrawal from the crvUSDP vault that I have deposits. I selected USDT as the coin that I wished to receive. And I double checked to make sure I selected USDT before I pressed the “Withdraw” button. After going through the approval and paying the fees, I received usdp3crv in my metamask wallet. I am disappointed with this outcome after paying a hefty fee in this transaction. usdp3crv coin has no use to me. Can you help?


[06/04/2021 9:56 AM] j.#6352
Go to curve.fi to withdraw to usdt


[06/04/2021 10:01 AM] aGGre#1350
deposited by mistake to a v1 vault. The migrate all button on yearn.finance does nothing. Should I withdraw and deposit again or there is another way?

everything worked, the problem was on my end.


[06/04/2021 10:43 AM] yakun#0023

Hi. I have been a loving user of yearn finance vaults. Here is a question regarding SNX vault before I deposit the asset. Is the vault works on staking the underlying asset (SNX) and borrow sUSD and earn interest in the sUSD as well? Or is it just staking SNX and doesn’t borrow sUSD?


[06/04/2021 8:18 PM] fifthelement#9984
Hey Guys, is there any issues with https://yearn.fi/lend right now ?


[06/04/2021 8:18 PM] fifthelement#9984
when I want to supply and click on APPROVE, it just rotates and nothing happens


[06/04/2021 8:41 PM] Dober#8643
So we always have to go back to curve.fi in order to withdraw to USDT or LINK if it was crvLINK? Why doesn't it just go straight to our original wallet address in its normal form (LINK as opposed to crvLINK)?


[06/04/2021 8:44 PM] fifthelement#9984

https://yearn.fi/lend doesnt work for me, when I click on supply or borrow button, it just spins


[06/04/2021 8:47 PM] fifthelement#9984
can anyone try it and see if it works for them ?


[06/04/2021 8:47 PM] fifthelement#9984

have you tried at http://v1.yearn.finance/lending


[06/05/2021 7:24 AM] ONI#6888
it does both yes. Stake snx (year lockup - rewards wont be able to be claimed until a year is over) and borrow and supply sUSD to our sUSD vault


[06/05/2021 7:24 AM] ONI#6888
because your in a crvToken vault and that is the deposit token


[06/05/2021 7:25 AM] ONI#6888
This is what our aim is to help simplify with zaps, both in and out. But at its core it takes a crvToken as deposit token so that is what it gives out.


[06/05/2021 7:25 AM] ONI#6888
If you have an error on yearn.finance trying to zap in or out Try at zapper.fi with higher slippage

Thanks mate. Just wondering then how the SNX vault APY is lower than the sUSD vault! Probable reason that comes to my mind is - massive over colaterization of SNX for sUSD borrowing! Is that correct or I’m missing something?


[06/05/2021 9:48 AM] ONI#6888
you can only borrow 1/5 of your total possibly less in susd or something like that I believe


[06/05/2021 9:49 AM] ONI#6888
if you want to know more details about that vault I would ask in #🧠strategies or #💻dev-open-chat

Coming back to my issue at hand... 

I use Ledger via Metamask and since the new "bridge" update I've been unable to get it to work. I'm currently trying to withdraw USDC from the v2 vault. The first time I did this I think the bridge worked, it pulled up ledger live, I created the bridge, and then I'm pretty sure it asked for confirmation on the ledger device. I rejected it and have since tried like 5 times to do the same thing and it just keeps queuing up new transactions but not pulling up the bridge in Ledger Live. I'll attach a screenshot of the metamask

You'll have to withdraw your ibethv2 to ETH first before depositing into the ETH yvault. I dont think zapper can use ibethv2. Typically, it should work if it has some liquidity in an AMM like Uniswap


[06/05/2021 3:12 PM] j.#6352
Otherwise, just withdraw then deposit to the vault


[06/05/2021 3:13 PM] tai#7133
got it. thansks. but then the app should not allow me to approve my ibethv2 token.


[06/05/2021 3:14 PM] j.#6352
it doesnt know that. it will look for any ERC20 tokens you have and show it


[06/05/2021 3:16 PM] tai#7133
but the vault WETH only accepts ETH or any ERC20 tokens (exclude interest bearing tokens)?


[06/05/2021 3:18 PM] j.#6352
You can "Zap" into vaults from almost any token, given enough liquidity or routes. The Zap will swap the token you select into the base asset that the vault accepts


[06/05/2021 3:18 PM] j.#6352
In your case, it looks like ibethv2 cant be found anywhere so it cant be swapped for anything to get to eth

[06/05/2021 9:39 PM] Dober#8643
I've experienced that a few times. Basically the contract fails and you lose the gas fees. It sucks. Has also happened to me when doing a BTC transaction.


[06/05/2021 9:47 PM] Dober#8643
The wrong apy is normally due to when people have only been in a vault for a day or two. I had the same issue and talked to one of their people on Telegram.

[06/06/2021 3:27 AM] ONI#6888
Yes. These are different measures


[06/06/2021 3:28 AM] ONI#6888
APY is an estimate calculated based off numbers. Thus it depends what numbers you start with.


[06/06/2021 3:29 AM] ONI#6888
If you hover over growth on the website it says how our main site calculates APY

[06/06/2021 3:31 AM] ONI#6888
On the site we report weekly or monthly APY. Trackavault can show you daily. The reason we should you weekly or monthly is because its more accurate. Daily is not a good measure for vaults unless you know what its saying.


[06/06/2021 3:32 AM] ONI#6888
There are times when daily will be high, and will be 0. That is ok because that is how the vaults work, they might not call harvest every day (only realize yield/gains when harvest is called), but again, that is by design and a feature not a flaw.


[06/06/2021 3:33 AM] ONI#6888

if you are using our site yearn.finance and setting the default gas price and limits this shouldnt happen

you can more accuartely set gas price at gasnow.org, also do **not** change the gas limit unless you know what your doing and are a dev

I was invested in the 3crvV1 vault and then deposited the balance in powerpool YLA. Is there any reason I should get out of YLA, migrate to v2 and then redeposit?
not sure how thats handled under the hood


[06/06/2021 5:31 AM] ONI#6888
No YLA has already migrated to v2, and all YLA users tokens have migrated as well.


[06/06/2021 5:31 AM] ONI#6888
If you withdrawal from YLA you will have v2 Vault tokens.

Hey guys, I am trying to deposit some crvSTETH that I have in my Guarda wallet.  I can use WalletConnect to connect to yearn and the crvSTETH tokens are recognized and I can attempt to deposit them.  But on my wallet when I approve the transaction it always fails.  It also fails to ever estimate the TRX cost.  I have plenty of Eth in the wallet as well to cover the transaction(s).  I know there should be two transactions one to approve the spending of my tokens and then the deposit itself, but I never seem to get that far.  Any suggestions?


[06/06/2021 6:38 PM] Upstategirl#4282
I was also trying to deposit stETH n it failed from yearn and in zapper.fi too Edit: just posted in Zapper support too


[06/06/2021 6:43 PM] Upstategirl#4282
Here is another way that is possible from my previous inquiry on the vaults channel:    Courtesy of j yJanitor:  otherwise, deposit in curve https://curve.fi/steth/deposit and then deposit the lp tokens in yearn https://yearn.finance/vaults/0xdCD90C7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770B4325

Hi!
I have one question regarding zapping out of a vault.

I have deposited some crvUSDN in the vault, let's say I want to withdraw it denominated in DAI (I'm aware of the possible 1% slippage), how can I know in advance how many DAI I'll receive?

Will the amount pop up at the moment of confirming the tx?

Because in the website UI doesn't show it.


[06/06/2021 11:35 PM] VX#7009
Or, other side of the question, where can I see the conversion rate between crvUSDN and yvcrvUSDN?


[06/06/2021 11:40 PM] VX#7009
I can see the value of my yvcrvUSDN on Zapper, which is very cool.

Where do they pull the price from?
To me looks higher than what I expected and highly volatile (constantly floating in the range of a couple % points), I'd love recheck it by myself.


[06/07/2021 1:18 AM] VX#7009
Using a rough calculation I think 1 yvcrvUSDN = ~$1.04.

Would be nice if I could read that somewhere.


[06/07/2021 2:31 AM] ONI#6888
I wont show you but it might show the min amount received on zapper.fi


[06/07/2021 2:31 AM] ONI#6888
This is the share price of the vault found in the vaults' contract


[06/07/2021 2:32 AM] ONI#6888
best way to find share price is click on the vault name on yearn.finance


[06/07/2021 2:33 AM] ONI#6888
go to contract on etherscan


[06/07/2021 2:33 AM] ONI#6888
click read, usually #4 shareprice


[06/07/2021 2:33 AM] ONI#6888
normally it is on yearn.vision but we are currently in the process of updating the site


[06/07/2021 2:33 AM] ONI#6888
so it might now be on there


[06/07/2021 2:37 AM] VX#7009
pricePerShare shows 1006437283175131869 uint256.

How do I derive the ~$1.04 price from that number?

Back to zapper.fi, is their value estimation accurate?


[06/07/2021 2:42 AM] VX#7009
On yearn.vision it shows a share price of 1.088

But it's on v1


[06/07/2021 2:47 AM] VX#7009
Okay I think I found the correcr dashboarsd but USDN isn't there, as you anticipated


[06/07/2021 3:05 AM] ONI#6888
if you want to calculate it yourself the formula is: for non-curve vaults: share price * yvToken amount (pull from etherscan), for crv vaults: share price *  yvToken amount * curve virtual price


[06/07/2021 3:07 AM] ONI#6888
for usdn the virtual price is here: https://curve.fi/usdn

Thanks


[06/07/2021 4:42 AM] VX#7009
From my understanding the price per share is ~$1.00644

And I think I got why the amount that zapper shows me is higher than I expected, looks like they calculate it at current market price for USDN which is not $1 but rounded at $1.01

All clear now. Thanks again.


[06/07/2021 4:42 AM] ONI#6888
yes its a stablecoin but its price can fluctuate


[06/07/2021 4:42 AM] ONI#6888
so it might not always be equal to 1$


[06/07/2021 4:43 AM] ONI#6888
dont touch gas limit just change gas price, and this estimate is the max you will pay, not the actual amount. For 11 gwei (gas price) I would just send it, probably the cheapest price you will see for gas

Question regarding sign in with ledger on ETH mainnet: Failed to sign with Ledger device: U2F DEVICE_INELIGIBLE  - The ledger support said the issue has to do with the transport protocol yearn is using (u2f instead of webUSB).

On the Link vault, Is it possible to end up with less LINK than what I deposited? For example, the strategies don't work and I get charged management fees on top of it? Thanks


[06/07/2021 11:02 PM] vany#0365
fees are charged per block so if interest rates are low enough yes but you would see it on the site with negative interest showing


[06/07/2021 11:02 PM] vany#0365
v2 vaults can have a lot of strategies at once so super low interest is less likely vs the v1 vault


[06/07/2021 11:03 PM] kbhouse#5117
Thank you. Currently I can't see the APY for link vault. It says new.

Thank you. Is this the best way to farm link? Are you aware of other ways to do so?


[06/07/2021 11:06 PM] vany#0365
there is the crvLINK vault, that would mean you are pooling link and sLINK (so not just LINK). also bancor has a pool with rewards but IL protection means your link has to stay there for100 days

Hi, I am having trouble zapping USDC into the Yearn USDC V2 vault.  I am using metamask connected to a Trezor One wallet.  When I try to deposit USDC the transaction amount reads as $0 no matter how much I enter up to the max in my wallet.  Interestingly, it looks like I can deposit any amount of ETH but I  would rather deposit USDC.  Can you help me?


[06/08/2021 9:42 AM] arberx#3367
Yep issue with Trezor


[06/08/2021 9:42 AM] arberx#3367
Connect directly with the trezor (not with metamask)


[06/08/2021 9:52 AM] DeanF#9764
Hi, I connected directly to my trezor and attempted to deposit 100 USDC but metamask popped up with the same "0" amount +  gas fee.  I checked and trezor is selected as the wallet, not metamask so I am not sure why MM popped up.


[06/08/2021 9:52 AM] arberx#3367
Because you’re connecting with metamask through trezor!


[06/08/2021 9:52 AM] arberx#3367
You have to only go through trezor


[06/08/2021 9:53 AM] arberx#3367
Click your wallet at the top and select “trezor” not metamask


[06/08/2021 10:00 AM] DeanF#9764
Thanks for your help.  I just did that again and this time it did connect with Trezor.  However when I attempt the same transaction I get the confirmation message on my trezor and  it says something like "send message to..." then on the next screen "really send message paying up to 0.0017 ETH for gas?"   Normally this screen would include the USDC amount but it looks like only gas is being sent.  I didn't confirm since I don't want to send gas and no USDC.


[06/08/2021 10:05 AM] arberx#3367
I’m not familiar with trezor. You should try a transaction on your own and see what happens.


[06/08/2021 10:05 AM] arberx#3367
This is not a Yearn issue

[06/08/2021 4:56 PM] vany#0365
right now its better to buy yvboost on sushi than deposit due to discount fyi. zaps were disabled on yvboost due to some issues in the process


[06/08/2021 5:01 PM] jimmy.scrambles#0682
oh ok cool never thought to do that. so just buy and hold the yveCRV and not deposit it into the yvBOOST vault?

depositing into the contract is always 1:1, but there is a sushi pool to trade where its going for below 1:1. you can buy either yvecrv or yvboost. yvboos auto compunds to get you more yvecrv

Hey y’all if I’m bullish on ETH and want exposure to it but also want to make APY, which vaults should I be looking at? Was confused whether the yvBoost ones actually give me exposure but thanks to yJanitor I guess I have half ETH + curve exposure for that specific vault

There is no revenue share for YFI. See https://snapshot.org/#/yearn/proposal/Qmb6gBzjvgLMazSrQQGVcjutLNdkVyM2Lh6yckMzdoaHWZ

do all the protocol fees go into the buyback and build scheme?


[06/09/2021 11:39 AM] 0xmilk#7568

I think the link to the proposal describes it all completely including references to other proposals on spending

no. yvBOOST is a vault that earns you more yveCRV. yvBOOST-ETH is the liquidity pair on Sushiswap

ill pass along and ask if there are any errors. the other option would be to manually migrate (would be similar in gas costs as auto migrate) by going to pickle and withdrawing -> removing liquidity on sushi - depositing yvecrv to yvboost - add liquidity to yvboost - eth -> deposit to pickle


[06/09/2021 3:19 PM] haredog#6727
Thanks @vany but..... I am afraid I'd fook up the steps doing it manually.  Any chance it will work if I just go ahead and CONFIRM in MetaMask even with that error message?  I would hate to lose all that ETH?


[06/09/2021 3:19 PM] vany#0365
i would not recommend trying to do the tx with an error showing, could burn a lot of eth


[06/09/2021 3:20 PM] haredog#6727

I probably should have just left it alone.


[06/09/2021 3:20 PM] haredog#6727
transaction costs are as much as I have invested.


[06/09/2021 3:21 PM] haredog#6727
bummer


[06/09/2021 3:21 PM] vany#0365
yeah, might be worth waiting for gas to go under 9 again and just withdraw. unfortunately with high gas prices some of these complex farms are not economical with lower $ amounts


[06/09/2021 3:22 PM] haredog#6727
Yes, I am afraid I am learning that the hard way.

[06/09/2021 3:24 PM] vany#0365
the SLP is earning 9% just on trading fees so not the worst place, just no additional rewards on top


[06/09/2021 3:27 PM] haredog#6727
Aout those fees, where do they show up exactly?  Is it just in the value of the SLP?


[06/09/2021 3:29 PM] vany#0365
yes its just added to the LP position automatically

Hi, I just withdrew from the ETH vault and I never got it? My balance is now 0 yvWETH and I never got my ETH back. Transaction successful on etherscan.


[06/09/2021 3:39 PM] j.#6352
Check if you received WETH


[06/09/2021 3:41 PM] 0xCryptik#2132
OK, I see I received WETH, but I had selected ETH from withdraw. (Also took a minute or 2 after confirmation for WETH to show up but that may be a wallet issue)


[06/09/2021 3:42 PM] j.#6352
I think you always get WETH out if i remember right


[06/09/2021 3:43 PM] 0xCryptik#2132
The zap doesn't convert for you?


[06/09/2021 3:44 PM] j.#6352

[06/09/2021 10:22 PM] ┻┳ lolpaul#2099
Hey! Fairly new here and was wondering why I can't withdraw or "zap" out of the crvAlusd vault into another token or ETH? Can I only withdrawls crvAlusd. And where can I swap that?


[06/09/2021 10:27 PM] TorJado#3802
you could try on the zapper site itself


[06/09/2021 10:27 PM] TorJado#3802
that has more robust slippage options/etc


[06/09/2021 10:27 PM] TorJado#3802
otherwise, worst case, if zapping doesn't work, you can use yearn to trade ycrvaLusd for crvalusd and then go to curve and get your ALusd back


[06/09/2021 10:43 PM] ┻┳ lolpaul#2099
Dumb question but how do I use yearn to trade tokens? I don't think I've seen that anywhere. When you say trade ycrvalusd for crvAlusd do you mean yearn has a swapping feature? Also can you not zap out of every vault? Or only some of them?


[06/09/2021 10:46 PM] TorJado#3802
sorry, trade was an imprecise word


[06/09/2021 10:47 PM] TorJado#3802
in yearn, you deposit crvALUSD and get ycrvALUSD as your vault token


[06/09/2021 10:47 PM] TorJado#3802
"withdraw" on yearn is redeeming ycrvALUSD for crvALUSD tokens


[06/09/2021 10:47 PM] TorJado#3802
on the curve app, you can redeem crvALUSD for ALUSD


[06/09/2021 10:48 PM] TorJado#3802
theoretically, you can zap out of any vault, but there are some coding differences that may or may not have been done and/or the zap on the yearn site is more restrictive for slippage IIRC


[06/10/2021 1:06 AM] patt#0923
hi sorry if this has been asked before. Is there a way to see how much is the interest i get from yearn vault?

[06/10/2021 1:08 AM] George#5238

you can check yearn.fi

(Also posted in #💻dev-open-chat )
 Devs / members I will tip a generous amount of ETH to whoever helps me successfully withdraw my funds from the crvALUSD vault. 

I mistakenly approved a withdraw transaction of with a value of 0 ETH. I was obviously attempting to withdraw my full balance from the vault. 
Now, despite my full vault balance being displayed on the website, the website won’t let me withdraw (despite multiple attempts of trying on different computers).

How do I solve this???


[06/10/2021 2:00 PM] j.#6352
How does it now let you withdraw? Nothing happens when you click withdraw?


[06/10/2021 2:01 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
Exactly. It doesn’t prompt MetaMask from opening. I’ve tried clicking withdraw on multiple devices


[06/10/2021 2:07 PM] j.#6352
Try it on Zapper.fi. Connect your wallet, go to the Pool tab, click the minus symbol to withdraw


[06/10/2021 2:10 PM] j.#6352
It's also on Zerion if you want to use that instead https://app.zerion.io/invest/asset/yvCurve-alUSD-0xa74d4b67b3368e83797a35382afb776baae4f5c8

[06/10/2021 2:15 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
Zapper didn’t work


[06/10/2021 2:16 PM] j.#6352
What happened?


[06/10/2021 2:20 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
I now see a token called yvCurve-alUSD in my wallet


[06/10/2021 2:22 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
It said “Error swapping tokens.”


[06/10/2021 2:22 PM] j.#6352
What token were you withdrawing to?


[06/10/2021 2:23 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
ETH


[06/10/2021 2:23 PM] j.#6352
Id recommend you exit the long way


[06/10/2021 2:24 PM] j.#6352
yvcrvALUSD to curve alusd lp to whatever underlying then swap to eth


[06/10/2021 2:24 PM] j.#6352
or you can try the Zerion one if you want to risk wasting gas again


[06/10/2021 2:24 PM] j.#6352
gas is low so that's an option


[06/10/2021 2:25 PM] j.#6352
Zerion and Zapper use different contracts


[06/10/2021 2:25 PM] j.#6352
sometimes one is better than the other


[06/10/2021 2:30 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
How do I do that exactly? My nerves are shot so my mind is drawing a major blank


[06/10/2021 2:31 PM] j.#6352
on the withdraw window after clicking the minus symbol, you can select the token to withdraw to by clicking the token in the 'to' box

[06/10/2021 2:33 PM] j.#6352
You'll be shown a list of tokens that you can withdraw to, usually ETH DAI USDC USDT WBTC and the underlying


[06/10/2021 2:33 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
Yes I’m with you on that


[06/10/2021 2:33 PM] j.#6352
pick the underlying


[06/10/2021 2:33 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
Yes did that


[06/10/2021 2:34 PM] j.#6352
Didnt work? didnt you pick ETH instead of the underlying?


[06/10/2021 2:35 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335

[06/10/2021 2:36 PM] j.#6352
yes


[06/10/2021 2:36 PM] j.#6352
which is why i suggested withdrawing to the underlying first


[06/10/2021 2:36 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
Right


[06/10/2021 2:37 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
Zapper isn’t giving me the option to withdraw to alUSD


[06/10/2021 2:37 PM] j.#6352
youre only shown ETH DAI USDC USDT WBTC?


[06/10/2021 2:38 PM] CHADEZ 🍄#2335
Yes


[06/10/2021 2:45 PM] j.#6352
Try doing it directly on the contract on etherscan https://etherscan.io/address/0xa74d4b67b3368e83797a35382afb776baae4f5c8#writeContract

Okay, because normally it shows the total value of the transaction in "Total" or am I wrong?


[06/11/2021 3:32 AM] j.#6352
It's only shown if you are transferring ETH from your address. Otherwise, contract interactions, ERC20 transfers and anything else that is not an ETH transfer from your address will not be shown in that window

hi. I'm trying to deposit in the crvLINK v2 vault. already have a deposit in there and looking to add more. I have LINK in my metamask, but it isn't in the dropdown as an asset I can deposit. Is that no longer supported? do I have to convert my link to crvLink first?


[06/11/2021 7:36 PM] charlesfromage#0194
Been searching for how to withdraw from yearn v1 and am kind of stuck. It shows a "Portfolio Balance" of USD Coin on my dashboard. But when I go to Claim, there is nothing listed as available to claim.

Ah. Zapper must be showing the underlying token of the vault if yvBOOST is what you bought


[06/12/2021 3:44 AM] j.#6352
in that case, you dont have to do anything. yvBOOST autocompounds yveCRV's 3crv rewards for you automatically


[06/12/2021 3:44 AM] j.#6352
can you confirm in etherscan that you have yvboost in your wallet address? instead of yvecrv

The amount of yvBOOST wont change, but its value in yveCRV will


[06/12/2021 3:45 AM] PeedanJayni#1121
or the amount of denominated to yveCRV


[06/12/2021 3:45 AM] j.#6352
yvBOOST earns you more yveCRV

[06/13/2021 3:55 AM] Over#8596
Quick question: What is the claiming process after using yvUSDC vault?
I can't get my head around it. 
Is my yvUSDC increasing in USDC value, which means I can take out more out of the vault? Or do I get more yvUSDC units over time?  
If the first, in a scenario where a whale takes USDC out of the vault, the price drops and we get less earnings?


[06/13/2021 4:06 AM] j.#6352
Your yvUSDC amount doesnt change. Its value does. If a whale withdraws, or anyone else really, those tokens are burned in exchange for USDC.


[06/13/2021 4:08 AM] Over#8596
so burning those tokens, does not affect their overall value?

[06/14/2021 4:56 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
I think its cause I have the yearn thing as collat and its the old vault maybe


[06/14/2021 5:17 AM] ONI#6888
which pool are you trying to withdrawal from?

They are now waived so you are good to migrate


[06/14/2021 5:34 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
Basically I don't want to pay off the last bit if I can't get my collateral out


[06/14/2021 5:35 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
my theory is it's because I have y3crv as collateral and it's no longer counting that technically or something


[06/14/2021 5:36 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
that or dusd borrowing messed it up somehow


[06/14/2021 5:58 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
is it possible to just liquidate to possibly get around this? I saw there is a way to liquidate on etherscan but I don't know what amount to put in etc. If someone could help me with this I would really appreciate it


[06/14/2021 6:23 AM] Geologylvr#0481
Hi, this is my first time using yearn and I have a few questions. First how do I confirm that my ycurve made it to the vault? I checked the vault and it still has the option to deposit but it says zero under withdraw despite having completed the purchase. Second how can I see expected apy results? Thank you


[06/14/2021 6:32 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
I figured it out the UI is bugged or something


[06/14/2021 6:32 AM] getrichslow.eth#7140
its not showing things correctly and I must of owed more than it says?


[06/14/2021 6:45 AM] ONI#6888
which ui are you using?


[06/14/2021 6:45 AM] ONI#6888
try here https://v1.yearn.finance/lending


[06/14/2021 6:45 AM] ONI#6888
if its still not working probably best to ask in cream support channel


[06/14/2021 6:45 AM] ONI#6888
a deposit transaction has 2 steps: approval and deposit


[06/14/2021 6:46 AM] ONI#6888
if you only did one you havent deposited yet


[06/14/2021 6:46 AM] ONI#6888
if you did deposit just go to yearn.finance hit cntl+shift+r, and you balances will show up.


[06/14/2021 6:49 AM] ONI#6888
if it doesnt show anything under deposited, I would try to deposit again


[06/14/2021 7:40 AM] czhc#8224
question about yvBOOST: "Deposit the underlying vault asset directly or zap in using almost any token in your wallet."

on the UI, it just allows me to deposit yveCRV. what if i want to deposit USDT? do i need to manually do USDT > CRV > yveCRV > yvBOOST? i don't see a direct zap in yearn.finance :(


[06/14/2021 7:57 AM] ONI#6888
the yvBoost zap in is disabled while we improve it. So for now the best way is to just swap usdt to yvboost via matcha.xyz or another dex aggragator


[06/14/2021 8:07 AM] Codernaut#8563
What's up with the new WETH vault (0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c)?  Just saw the migration prompt go live ~45 minutes ago and was hoping for some documentation on the new vault.


[06/14/2021 8:21 AM] czhc#8224
Gotcha, thanks! Do I need to do anything else other than holding yvBOOST? It should accrue fees just by holding it right?


[06/14/2021 8:21 AM] ONI#6888
This is a newer version of the weth vault and it is the vault alETH uses

Ciao everyone, any issues with the sUSD withdrawal?


[06/14/2021 8:44 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
If I try to withdraw to other tokens does not even start the tx


[06/14/2021 8:45 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
if I try to get back sUSD it gives an error on metamask and then tx fails


[06/14/2021 8:47 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
Error is "ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code."


[06/14/2021 9:52 AM] ONI#6888
not yet we will make a announcement about it soon and it will be listed on vaults at yearn soon


[06/14/2021 10:23 AM] ONI#6888
are you using metamask on chrome?


[06/14/2021 10:23 AM] ONI#6888
i would try to reconnect and hit cntl+shift+r


[06/14/2021 10:37 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
Ok will try


[06/14/2021 10:37 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
Thnx


[06/14/2021 10:40 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
no still the same error


[06/14/2021 10:40 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
using firefox


[06/14/2021 10:40 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
also just withdrawed from an IB vault without issues


[06/14/2021 10:40 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
and redeployed to an alUSD also no issues


[06/14/2021 10:40 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
it's specific to the sUSD contract


[06/14/2021 10:44 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
same happens also if I try via zapper: get an error "Try reloading the page or logging out then reconnecting your wallet. Reach out to us if this persists. You can also try increasing the slippage."


[06/14/2021 10:44 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
I tried to increase the slippage and it still fails without triggering metamask


[06/14/2021 10:48 AM] j.#6352
have you tried this with chrome? i have issues with metamask on firefox sometimes. runs on chrome ok


[06/14/2021 10:55 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
same error also on Chrome


[06/14/2021 10:55 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code.


[06/14/2021 10:56 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
also an estimated gas fee that is very high (like 800$ even if gas is relatively low now)


[06/14/2021 10:57 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
and if I try to withdraw to other tokens (not to sUSD), I get a "Returned error: execution reverted"


[06/14/2021 10:57 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
and it does not even trigger metamask


[06/14/2021 10:57 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
u guys are sure there is no issues with the sUSD v2 vaults?


[06/14/2021 10:58 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
(also I tried both frontends .fi and .finance and also zapper)


[06/14/2021 10:58 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
on both Chrome and Firefox


[06/14/2021 11:00 AM] ONI#6888
if you try it and go to inspect console what does it say?


[06/14/2021 11:02 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
Unchecked lastError value: Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.


[06/14/2021 11:11 AM] ONI#6888
ok thanks


[06/14/2021 11:12 AM] ONI#6888
on this one were you trying a regular withdrawal or a zap out from sUSD?


[06/14/2021 11:14 AM] ONI#6888
Guessing it was on a zap out?


[06/14/2021 11:14 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
tried both


[06/14/2021 11:14 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
zap out does not trigger tx in metamask just gives "Returned error: execution reverted"


[06/14/2021 11:15 AM] ONI#6888
ok


[06/14/2021 11:15 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
out into sUSD triggers metamask tx but a) expected gas fees are extremely high (like 800-1000$) even with current low gas prices and b) on metamask gives a "ALERT: Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code" warning in red below


[06/14/2021 11:16 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
if I proceed with tx, it fails (but consumes some of the gas)


[06/14/2021 11:16 AM] ONI#6888
yah ok


[06/14/2021 11:16 AM] ONI#6888
let me look into this


[06/14/2021 11:16 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243

[06/14/2021 11:16 AM] ONI#6888
is this just metamask and chrome or with ledger too?


[06/14/2021 11:17 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
I have ledger too


[06/14/2021 11:17 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
not chrome 91


[06/14/2021 11:17 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
I have an older unapdated one


[06/14/2021 11:17 AM] ONI#6888
I mean are you using it in this transaction?


[06/14/2021 11:17 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
and also triex with firefox


[06/14/2021 11:17 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
yes I use it in this tx


[06/14/2021 11:18 AM] ONI#6888
humm I know there was a recent update that broke some stuff with ledger/metamask and chrome


[06/14/2021 11:18 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
indeed


[06/14/2021 11:18 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
that's why I have been using firefox for the past few days


[06/14/2021 11:18 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
but I just did withdraw from an IB valut and redeployed to the alUSD valut without issues


[06/14/2021 11:18 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
so it's spexcific to the sUSD vault


[06/14/2021 11:19 AM] crypto_navi#7883
Sorry if it's been posted already, but fyi, there's a 500 error from the zapper API trying to zap into the yvBoost-Eth v2 Vault on the yearn.finance site. Here's the request URL (minus my address) : `https://api.zapper.fi/v1/zap-in/pickle/transaction?api_key=f589c526-31ae-4f74-b055-9441c9eeed5a&slippagePercentage=0.01&gasPrice=15000000000&poolAddress=0xced67a187b923f0e5ebcc77c7f2f7da20099e378&sellTokenAddress=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000&sellAmount=1000000000000000000&ownerAddress=`


[06/14/2021 11:20 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
I think zapper had an issue with the contracts with Polygon and they exploited the bug themselves


[06/14/2021 11:20 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
they might have stopped the api for safety ?


[06/14/2021 11:20 AM] ONI#6888
yvboost-eth zap is disabled

Hi, I got a message that I need to migrate my ETH to a v2 vault. I did it but now I can’t find the v2vault! Can you help me find my ETH? I’m using the MetaMask app on iOS.


[06/14/2021 9:34 PM] vany#0365
Do you not see it on metamask or yearn.finance?


[06/14/2021 11:53 PM] DerinJapan#8325
No, just a message to migrate or withdraw. If I click those now shows a balance of zero 😱


[06/15/2021 12:30 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
It has worked now: the error disappeared and the expeted gas fees went back to more reasonalbe ones


[06/15/2021 12:31 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
did you fix anything on the frontend or backend?


[06/15/2021 12:31 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
do you know what happened yesterday with the sUSD vault?


[06/15/2021 2:39 AM] ONI#6888
No sure honestly, could be something with zapper api


[06/15/2021 4:12 AM] DerinJapan#8325
All good!  I was able to log in on yearn.fi and find the v2 vault. 😬


[06/15/2021 4:20 AM] ONI#6888
do you still not see it?


[06/15/2021 4:20 AM] ONI#6888
you should only see the new eth vault on yearn.finance. Unless you still have a balance on the old eth v2 vault, then it will show you a migration banner.


[06/15/2021 4:41 PM] Jackten#9086
It appears I've instantly lost 28% of my investment after depositing to the yvBOOST vault.  Can someone help me understand what happened?


[06/15/2021 4:44 PM] Jackten#9086
Is it just a display error?


[06/15/2021 4:45 PM] Jackten#9086
Did I get sandwiched?


[06/15/2021 4:50 PM] Jackten#9086
The slippage was set to 1% so I don't understand where all the value went


[06/15/2021 4:53 PM] vany#0365
which one did you deposit into and with what token?


[06/15/2021 4:57 PM] vany#0365
yvboost trades at a discount on sushi but if you depsoit via the yvecrv contract it always swaps it 1:1. so if its ever under peg its better to buy from sushi than to deposit into the contract


[06/15/2021 5:39 PM] Matt W#6096
In the backscratcher pslp yvBoost farm under earned I am showing a pickle balance earned and it shows a 29% APY however my staked balance has not changed where can I see the APY rewards other than the pickle?


[06/15/2021 6:22 PM] Jackten#9086
I deposited Dai into the yvBOOST  on yearn.fi


[06/15/2021 6:28 PM] Jackten#9086
This is the transaction:
- Redacted-

Does that mean I deposited to the wrong contact?


[06/15/2021 6:38 PM] Jackten#9086
The only thing I can think of that would explain so a large loss is that there wasn't liquidity on one of the exchange pairs, but then I don't know why the transaction didn't fail for having too much slippage


[06/15/2021 7:02 PM] Karuzel#8918

[06/15/2021 7:10 PM] vany#0365
the zap picks between market buying yvecrv or deposing crv and receiving yvecrv 1:1. the tx shows the zap deposited into the yvecrv contract to get 1:1 yvecrv. the price decrease you see is because yvecrv is trading at a discount on sushi


[06/15/2021 7:12 PM] vany#0365
it looks like it picked that route due to the size of the zap


[06/15/2021 7:27 PM] Jackten#9086
Damn.. so the yvecrv is trading at a 28% discount on Sushi?

But if I withdraw would I still get that 1:1 conversion coming back, regaining the lost value?

Thank you for your insight

Also can you confirm if that's you in my DMs


[06/15/2021 7:30 PM] vany#0365
correct. it fluxuates pretty hard actually but ranges from 5%-30% discounts sometimes. but the current zap is not routed to buy yvboost from sushi

You need to reproduce and fix this so that not more funds are lost.

What UI were you using, yearn.finance?


[06/16/2021 3:11 AM] kx9x#3778
Maybe a check for mainnet can be added


[06/16/2021 3:12 AM] kx9x#3778
Make sure to always double check what you are signing though, I think metamask or whatever wallet showing matic being spent should have been a fair warning

We dont have a date yet for when the older eth v2 vault would stop working (or if it will), but we do have a new eth v2 vault. It's an updated vault version so it has many updates which make it better overall than the older eth v2 vault.

anyone can fork Yearn, but that doesnt mean it's related or supported by Yearn. this one could be a scam


[06/16/2021 1:15 PM] e-gons#5016
I recently made a small deposit into the YFI (v2) vault. Now, I see a different balance for yvYFI on yearn.finance and in the "Platforms-->Yearn" section of Zapper.fi compared with Etherscan and my wallet (Argent). Etherscan and my wallet show the correct amount. Yearn and Zapper are showing a higher amount. It appears that my small deposit was double-counted on year.finance. I am offered the ability to withdraw the double-counted amount from the YFI (v2) vault. Will one of the Yearn admin's please DM me to get to the bottom of this? Cheers


[06/16/2021 1:16 PM] j.#6352

Nope. The amount displayed is the actual deposited + recent deposit. Just the recent deposit was double-counted. These aren't the actual numbers but say I had 1 yvYFI before the recent deposit. I deposited 0.5. Now yearn.finance and zapper.fi (in the platforms section) are showing 2.0 yvYFI instead of 1.5.


[06/16/2021 1:24 PM] j.#6352
can you confirm that what you're seeing is yvYFI and not YFI?


[06/16/2021 1:27 PM] e-gons#5016
Confirmed I am seeing yvYFI and not YFI. To be fair it's hard to tell on Zapper which is which as both are referred to as YFI (v2). Happy to share etherscan txn details to help problem solve in DM.


[06/16/2021 1:29 PM] j.#6352
Ok yes let's do that. i have yvYFI myself so i can check for you


[06/16/2021 4:58 PM] qqq#7268
I have another question: is there a place I could get a list of the yEarn smart contracts? the docs only point to a smart-contract that you can use to get addresses somehow, but obviously this is not convenient
wait, even the SC doesn't work, because it's only meant for Vaults, I think.

crvALUSD on yearn.finance shows 5.78% yield, it ignores the ALCX yield I think


[06/17/2021 2:54 AM] Marco | Matter Labs#0243
and on yearn.fi 15.74%


[06/17/2021 3:45 AM] qqq#7268
hmm, I have another question then; I asked about yhe yEarn smart contracts. on your docs, there is a separate section for yVaults and yEarn, but I get the feeling they are the same.


[06/17/2021 3:45 AM] qqq#7268
correct or wrong?

Hi, I had eth in the eth vault 2 and I can't see it anymore yet it still shows up on zapper. Is something going on as part of the new eth vault they opened?

Is a $40 transaction fee migrating from the old ETHv2 to the new normal?


[06/17/2021 9:21 AM] arberx#3367
Sounds decent. You could wait a bit though during single digit gas


[06/17/2021 9:21 AM] arberx#3367
To do it


[06/17/2021 9:35 AM] gunter#7871
Would a withdrawal have been relatively similar cost? 33 token transfers?


[06/17/2021 9:36 AM] RecBeat_#3979

[06/17/2021 9:49 AM] gunter#7871

Hmm ok just confused why it needed to do all those transfers instead of just giving me the new YVWETH


[06/17/2021 3:07 PM] gunter#7871
After looking into it some more it sounds like it removed it from the vault strategy and not the vault balance? That's odd because it told me the old ETHv2 was inactive so shouldn't it all just be available?


[06/17/2021 5:00 PM] 2weiX#7165

I now have crvEURS LP token, but yearn doesnt show them as available

I have 5000 eursCRV (0x194ebd173f6cdace046c53eacce9b953f28411d1) in my wallet but on yearn.finance they do not show.

Funny enough: the TOKEN has the ticker *eursCRV*, on yearn.finance the thing is called *crvEURS* would it be possible that I am simply confusing them (or, also, that yearn didnt bother to adhere to the curve.fi taxonomy)?

[06/19/2021 9:00 AM] ONI#6888
?


[06/19/2021 9:01 AM] ArzrA#0305
on v1 I just got all the rewards at once pretty much once daily... now in the v2 vaults it keeps on becoming more over time when I refresh the page so I assume the rewards are streamed over some period of time?!


[06/19/2021 9:02 AM] ArzrA#0305
my "deposited" amount keeps on slowly increasing if this is more clear 🙂


[06/19/2021 9:23 AM] ONI#6888
vaults call harvest at the least once a week, but usually more often. There is no set schedule. You can check trackavault.com to see your profits. If you see your profit increase that is when harvest has been called


[06/19/2021 10:36 AM] jeromeku#0098
Hi all — I zapped into the yvBoost vault with $5000 USDC but only received ~2455 yvBoost tokens, worth ~$3850, in return.  Why is there a $1200 discrepancy?


[06/19/2021 11:27 AM] j.#6352
My guess is the zap bought CRV and deposited it in the yveCRV vault and then into the yvBOOST vault instead of buying yvBOOST directly


[06/19/2021 12:16 PM] jeromeku#0098
Thanks -- but this still doesn't explain $1200 discrepancy -- shouldn't I receive $5000 worth of yvBoost tokens in return?


[06/19/2021 12:17 PM] j.#6352
In that case, no because yvBOOST trades at a discount to CRV on Sushiswap. CRV to yvBOOST is not 1:1. yvBOOST is compounding yveCRV.


[06/19/2021 12:19 PM] jeromeku#0098
Thanks for the clarification.  Does that mean that if I withdraw my yvBoost for USDC right now, I'll receive roughly $5000 (i.e., what I put in a couple hours ago)?


[06/19/2021 12:20 PM] j.#6352
No


[06/19/2021 12:21 PM] jeromeku#0098
? So I'm facing an immediate $1200 loss when I deposited $5000 of USDC into the yvBoost vault?


[06/19/2021 12:22 PM] j.#6352
If you can confirm on etherscan that your transaction did what i described, then yes


[06/19/2021 12:29 PM] jeromeku#0098
I think so: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xebbb5e0c09895d8da5468bc4dd36815a77acc05376e42b1523279016b824941b.  How can I recover the $1200 then?


[06/19/2021 12:33 PM] j.#6352
You can't. That's not how it works


[06/19/2021 12:34 PM] jeromeku#0098
How could I have avoided this?  By exchanging my USDC for yvBoost directly?


[06/19/2021 12:34 PM] j.#6352
Yes on Sushiswap


[06/19/2021 12:35 PM] j.#6352
I just checked. I'm quoted 3230.91 yvBOOST for 5000 USDC


[06/19/2021 12:37 PM] jeromeku#0098
Is this something I should contact Zapper about then?  I think it's ridiculous that I lost $1200 by zapping instead of just exchanging


[06/19/2021 12:39 PM] j.#6352
Yea i think so. Zaps are being improved but no idea on time

Hey, I have a question regarding  the yvBOOST vault


[06/19/2021 2:33 PM] JoFoSho#0829
let's say I zap in 100$ worth of a token


[06/19/2021 2:33 PM] JoFoSho#0829
a week later I want to withdraw it


[06/19/2021 2:34 PM] JoFoSho#0829
if I choose to withdraw it in the form of ether do I get 100$ worth of ether or whatever the token is worth at that moment?


[06/19/2021 2:38 PM] JoFoSho#0829
also can I add eth into the boost vaults?


[06/19/2021 2:40 PM] j.#6352
I wouldnt recommend zapping in the yvBOOST vault with anything other than yveCRV. see the conversation above to see why.
It would be cheaper to buy yvBOOST on Sushiswap currently


[06/19/2021 2:46 PM] JoFoSho#0829
right


[06/19/2021 2:49 PM] JoFoSho#0829
so if I buy yvboost on sushiswap I can deposit those into the vault?


[06/19/2021 2:52 PM] j.#6352
yvBOOST is the vault token


[06/19/2021 2:54 PM] JoFoSho#0829
um, what does that mean?


[06/19/2021 2:58 PM] j.#6352
depositing in vaults will give you vault tokens in return which represents the value you deposited


[06/19/2021 2:58 PM] j.#6352
See https://docs.yearn.finance/yearn-finance/yvaults/vault-tokens


[06/19/2021 3:00 PM] JoFoSho#0829
ohhhhhh


[06/19/2021 3:02 PM] JoFoSho#0829
how do we profit from the vaults then? is it when I withdraw the underlying tokens?


[06/19/2021 3:03 PM] j.#6352
Vaults have strategies that earn yield. This yield is what increases the value of vault tokens over time. So when you withdraw fully, you should get your initial deposit plus any yield earned


[06/19/2021 7:26 PM] SweetFeet#9262

Just want to know if there is a solution for this error, everytime I try to withdraw from the SUSD valut on v2 I receive this error, i have reloaded , connected and disconnected my wallet and tried to do the transaction on other devices. Not sure why and this only happens on this vault.

It’s not a bug, a whale withdrew like 20% of the entire supply last saturday taking all the buffer funds and even taking an IL loss ( around 0.2%). Withdraw by default allows losses no greater than 0.01% but with the current state of the pool the slippage is quite bigger than that even for small withdraws, therefore the default withdraws throw an inception

Hello, Its been 4 days since I tried to migrate to the new ETH Vault, the transaction was approved but the migration its not complete. I still have  yvWETH in my wallet... anyone having the same problem? whats is going on?

[06/21/2021 9:12 AM] ONI#6888
This is just to approve spending the vault token now you actually have to migrate. Just try it again and it will work


[06/21/2021 9:42 AM] RecBeat_#3979
thanks


[06/21/2021 10:04 AM] swansonbenson#7475
what does this mean... will we just need to wait for the buffer funds to be replenished?


[06/21/2021 12:15 PM] crabsinger#0001
I ran out of gas withdrawing from USDC v2 vault with a limit of  1.1m gas. Is that normal that withdraws need that or a higher gas limit?


[06/21/2021 12:21 PM] crabsinger#0001
Answering my own question: looking at the contract and other withdrawals, I see a limit of 2m often used and an example tx with gas used of 1,247,081 (61.41%). So yes, need more gas.


[06/21/2021 1:15 PM] Javalasers#8212
any idea why deposit gas limits have shot up? I'm seeing 14236085 when I try to deposit into crvSTETH, which at current gwei for gas (~30) and current ETH price (~$1993) works out to over $800. this seems like a bug given it's perhaps 20X previous deposit gas in USD, and current gwei for gas is not particularly high(?)


[06/21/2021 1:15 PM] ONI#6888
this should be an error is there a red error text on this transaction?


[06/21/2021 1:16 PM] ONI#6888
it should price gas limit correctly, did your trx not do that?


[06/21/2021 1:16 PM] Javalasers#8212
no transaction; luckily metamask warned me I had insufficient ETH in the wallet and wouldn't let me start the transaction 🙂


[06/21/2021 1:16 PM] ONI#6888
for now yes best to wait and try again soon.


[06/21/2021 1:16 PM] ONI#6888
yah that is an error


[06/21/2021 1:17 PM] Javalasers#8212
any workaround? I cleared my cookies like a caveman. 😛 no joy


[06/21/2021 1:17 PM] ONI#6888
try cntl+shift+r


[06/21/2021 1:17 PM] Javalasers#8212
did that as well


[06/21/2021 1:17 PM] ONI#6888
via metamask?


[06/21/2021 1:18 PM] ONI#6888
This is for a deposit?


[06/21/2021 1:18 PM] Javalasers#8212
regular deposit, not withdrawal


[06/21/2021 1:18 PM] Javalasers#8212
yes, using metamask


[06/21/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
do you have enough eth in your wallet to cover a normal trx?


[06/21/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
like greater than 50$


[06/21/2021 1:19 PM] Javalasers#8212
yep


[06/21/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
can you open up the dev console and see if it shows an error when you try to deposit


[06/21/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
right click webpage inspect


[06/21/2021 1:19 PM] Javalasers#8212
dev console in chrome or metamask, sorry?


[06/21/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
chrome


[06/21/2021 1:20 PM] ONI#6888
refresh the page


[06/21/2021 1:20 PM] ONI#6888
open chrome dev console, deposit, look at console


[06/21/2021 1:21 PM] Javalasers#8212
no error appears when I click deposit


[06/21/2021 1:21 PM] ONI#6888
but a metamask pop-up happens?


[06/21/2021 1:22 PM] ONI#6888
have your tried a different browser or incognito mode?


[06/21/2021 1:22 PM] Javalasers#8212
yes metamask pop-up happens, just showing a very high gas limit


[06/21/2021 1:22 PM] ONI#6888
can I get a picture of the trx it shows


[06/21/2021 1:22 PM] ONI#6888
or what is the gaslimit set to


[06/21/2021 1:23 PM] Javalasers#8212
there is an error on page load (not when I press deposit). don't want to dox myself but start of URL is https://api.yearn.tools/user/0x


[06/21/2021 1:23 PM] Javalasers#8212
gas limit in tx is 14236085 as I mentioned above


[06/21/2021 1:25 PM] ONI#6888
does the error msg say anything or just a url?


[06/21/2021 1:26 PM] ONI#6888
try at mirror.yearn.finance maybe


[06/21/2021 1:31 PM] Javalasers#8212

[06/21/2021 1:38 PM] ONI#6888
We might not support that wallet will it let you try via generic web 3 or wallet connect maybe?


[06/21/2021 1:41 PM] Lazuli#9648
How do I use generic web 3? I have LINK deposited from this wallet that I connected through injection via metamask, but something changed. I don't need it now just noticed it wasn't connecting and if I'll be able to connect eventually or have to do it a different way


[06/21/2021 2:33 PM] ONI#6888
try to clear you cookies for our site and try again


[06/21/2021 2:41 PM] Javalasers#8212
I figured it out! I had been in this pool previously, and I had a small erc20 allowance still remaining from my previous trips in and out (I tend not to accept infinite allowances). Saw this small remaining allowance at revoke.cash. The yearn site was not showing the "approve" affordance presumably since I had >0 allowance, but in order for this transaction to work I'd need to approve a much higher spend of crvSTETH tokens from my wallet. To keep things simple, I revoked the allowance down to exactly zero using revoke.cash. Then I returned to yearn and it showed the "approve" step before deposit. I approved a high-enough allowance for the deposit I wanted to make, and then the deposit went through without issue after that.


[06/21/2021 2:43 PM] Javalasers#8212
So two bug reports I'd submit based on this experience: 1. would be really helpful if yearn explicitly checked erc20 allowance against proposed deposit amount and popped up the affordance for "approve" if an additional allowance is needed. [Today it seems like the check is simply "is allowance >0?"]. 2. It's still very, very strange that the failure mode if allowance is too low is to show a transaction with a crazy-high gas fee. This just seems like a straight-up bug. I replicated this bug by setting an allowance slightly below the desired deposit amount first, BTW, so it's hopefully fully repeatable for yearn devs as well.


[06/21/2021 2:44 PM] Javalasers#8212
Very happy to have my situation sorted, and I hope the bug report helps prevent confusion for other folks who are cautious with infinite allowances in the future!


[06/21/2021 2:45 PM] ONI#6888
Yes that makes alot of sense, allowances will do that.


[06/21/2021 2:49 PM] ONI#6888
thanks for the feedback fwd'd to the web team


[06/21/2021 3:30 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes, yearn will provide a buffer for people to withdraw without any problem from any website until deposits grow up naturally

if you want to go all the way back to eth you must harvest & exit -> go to Jars page and withdraw -> go to sushi pool and withdraw 100% then sell yvboost for eth

I had 2.51 ETH in the yearn ETH V2 vault, and without doing anything I now have 2.482 yvWETH in my metamask.  It would seem that my ETH has been migrated to a new vault for me, but 2.51 ETH still shows as Deposited in the old ETH V2 vault.  Anyone knows what's going on?  Also, is ETH / yvWETH 1:1? .... because it seems like a very expensive migration if so.


[06/23/2021 5:24 AM] j.#6352
ETH =/= yvWETH https://docs.yearn.finance/yearn-finance/yvaults/vault-tokens


[06/23/2021 5:39 AM] dee_swaby#1456
ok, I think I've succesfully migrated now as the yellow warning sign above the vault is gone.  But the vault still looks the same... just says ETH and V2 with 0.06% APY.  Is this right?


[06/23/2021 5:40 AM] j.#6352
should be. it's the same vault but with some upgrades. you can check its strategies on yearn.watch if you want to nerd out on more data


[06/23/2021 5:41 AM] dee_swaby#1456
ok cool, thanks.  I'll have a look


[06/23/2021 5:45 AM] dee_swaby#1456
how often do the upgrades occur?  Being forced to migrate eats away at yields with gas fees

If slippage is the problem, you can zap out through Zapper.fi instead. Yearn's Zapper integration is set to 1% slippage by default. You can change this on Zapper.fi. Another workaround would be to withdraw normally, then withdraw on Curve


[06/23/2021 7:36 AM] venture#0786

I need some help. I'm new to Yearn, and I'm trying to familiarize myself with everything. I knew I'd take some hits with gas fees as I learned, but I just paid $60 for absolutely nothing. No vault created, no veCRV, or USDC recognized. What's the catch?


[06/23/2021 8:47 AM] j.#6352
I'm guessing you zapped in. check https://app.pickle.finance. Connect your wallet and you should see your pSLP there


[06/23/2021 8:47 AM] j.#6352
Which vault did you use?


[06/23/2021 8:48 AM] rüv#1113
it doesn't seem


[06/23/2021 8:49 AM] j.#6352
If you don't have pSLP, then you're probably just pooling on Sushiswap's yvBOOST/ETH pair. you can check this on https://app.sushi.com/yield. Otherwise, im sure it's in https://app.pickle.finance/ and you havent navigated around enough

It does. But I have no balance on pickle. I tried to create a USDC vault on yborrow, but it picked up no balances from my wallet...but charged me a crazy gas fee.


[06/23/2021 9:11 AM] j.#6352
oh this is completely different then. i think you might be looking for https://yborrow.finance


[06/23/2021 9:16 AM] yaygirl#0106
I went to both sites. I put my CRV in the vault on yearn. I didn't lose my yveCRV. It just went back to my wallet. When I went to yborrow, it charged me the gas fee, but no vault, and it didn't recognize any balances.


[06/23/2021 9:17 AM] j.#6352

hi folks, I have a question about the old weth vault. About 17 days ago, I used my vault as collateral on abracadabra. I borrowed very conservatively, I'm not even close to any immediate risk of liquidation, BUT it seems like yearn is no longer taking new deposits into that vault? And migrating deposits to a new vault? Is my collateral safe? Will I be required to withdraw in order to migrate at some point in the near future?


[06/23/2021 11:44 AM] ONI#6888
You would need to check with abracadabra but they might migrate it for you not 100% sure on this, best to ask them if you need to manually migrate.


[06/23/2021 11:45 AM] ONI#6888
the older eth/weth vault is still working for now, we just recommend people to migrate to the newer version.

i deposited into USDN and EURS vaults yesterday. I'm using the feeltheyearn app to track  earnings. I noticed that USDN earnings are increasing in value (after 24 hours), but EUROs hasnt yet. Does EURS harvest or accrue at a different time interval than USDN? Not sure if I should be concerned or not.

hey admin - wondering if i connected a wallet and moved USDC to a vault why it sitll shows up as asset in wallet and as available in vault?


[06/23/2021 10:56 PM] arberx#3367
Did you do two transactions?


[06/23/2021 10:57 PM] blibby#1998
not that i'm aware of, what do you mean?


[06/23/2021 10:58 PM] arberx#3367
Eth contract interactions require two transactions


[06/23/2021 10:59 PM] arberx#3367
1. Allow the contract to spend 2. Actually send the funds


[06/23/2021 10:59 PM] arberx#3367
You probably only approved


[06/23/2021 11:00 PM] blibby#1998

[06/23/2021 11:07 PM] arberx#3367
Okay then you should try to deposit again at yearn.finance


[06/23/2021 11:07 PM] arberx#3367
I’m pretty sure you only did the approval


[06/23/2021 11:08 PM] blibby#1998
oh


[06/23/2021 11:08 PM] blibby#1998
how do i deposit?


[06/23/2021 11:10 PM] blibby#1998
so i pay gas fees twice


[06/23/2021 11:10 PM] blibby#1998
?


[06/23/2021 11:43 PM] vany#0365
every time you use an erc-20 token and its interacting with a new contract it requires an approval tx before actually moving your funds, so yes you have to pay  two gas fees


[06/24/2021 12:05 AM] ONI#6888
Your good no worries 👍


[06/24/2021 12:07 AM] ONI#6888
Yes they increase at different times, and no reason to worry. All vaults are working as intended. Harvests can be as fast as every day or as slow every week

[06/24/2021 11:29 AM] evets#1112
Hi, I am curious, what is the difference between depositing into the new yVault: crvTricrypto and depositing into the Curve pool directly?


[06/24/2021 11:31 AM] arberx#3367
More curve rewards


[06/24/2021 11:32 AM] arberx#3367
Yearn locks up a bunch of curve for max rewards


[06/24/2021 11:32 AM] evets#1112
so ultimately the same thing modulo more curve rewards if we go through the yearn vault versus curve directly?


[06/24/2021 11:32 AM] arberx#3367
Yes


[06/24/2021 11:32 AM] arberx#3367
And auto compounding


[06/24/2021 11:32 AM] evets#1112
got it, ty


[06/24/2021 11:48 AM] evets#1112
One more question. When you withdraw from the tricrypto vault, it looks like you can withdraw in a single asset, not just the crvTricrypto asset. I'd imagine that if you withdraw in say, ETH, you won't have the compounded awards that you otherwise would if you withdraw in crvTricrypto and then go exchange that asset on Curve for the underlying funds? Or am I mistaken there?


[06/24/2021 11:51 AM] arberx#3367
The withdrawing into any asset is just a yearn thing


[06/24/2021 11:51 AM] arberx#3367
You can zap in and out to any asset


[06/24/2021 11:52 AM] arberx#3367
Yearn will market buy/sell your vault rewards/principle for what you specify


[06/24/2021 11:52 AM] evets#1112
When you withdraw into a non crv LP token, does it add the rewards in?


[06/24/2021 11:52 AM] evets#1112
I see.


[06/24/2021 12:23 PM] Gurupa01#2522
I figured it out. I had to clear my browsing data from google chrome. WOW. Took me only 3 days and i had even read this on a Reddit thread. Love seeing my ETH back on there!

Hello there, i cannot see my balance to deposit on the CrvTricrypto vault. I have unstake it on curve. And i see the balance on MM wallet, and wallet is connected. What could be the issue?


[06/24/2021 5:45 PM] Gilly#2698
It also asks me to swith MM to mainnet but it already is.


[06/24/2021 6:20 PM] evets#1112
So after I deposit into the tricrypto vault, where can I go to see how my assets are performing? if anywhere?


[06/24/2021 7:03 PM] Gilly#2698
It connects to my wallet but i get this message all the time:

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.

Hey friends, pretty new to defi and i just tried to deposit some USDT into the crvTriCrypto vault through yearn.finance. the second tx failed with an error 'SafeERC20: low-level call failed' and now im left with some yvCurve-triCrypto tokens in my wallet im not sure what to do with. Any advice here? 😅


[06/25/2021 8:52 AM] j.#6352
Weird. If you have yvTOKEN, that means you have a deposit in a vault. So it looks like you should be good.

both transactions were made when i deposited into the vault on yearn.finance, im not too sure what its trying to do under the hood


[06/25/2021 9:02 AM] j.#6352
it looks like a duplicate. so to me, it looks like you wanted to deposit twice. not sure about what the error means though

Hi,
The two EURS vault strategies have not harvested anything in 3 days (probably same issue Mala reported above).
I see their keeper address was updated recently to the Yearn Deployer contract one (tx below). 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fdf22c4e80f78edfed828a3cb976cc4103288f57cdcfba24a0461b73d981a75
Is that ok ? Should it not be a keeper address instead ?

Don't think there is one link in there that is accurately modeling ROI on the triCrypto pool. It's just an opaque view. This could be very much improved. You can't tell how performance is for that pool at all right now.


[06/25/2021 11:13 AM] j.#6352
It could be because of how new the vault is. Also, those are made by the community. Should be a matter of time until it gets added in

or you can do 27 with 10000000000000000000 as the input:

[06/27/2021 1:45 PM] kx9x#3778
but there is also no one with exactly 10 vault shares according to the holders


[06/27/2021 1:45 PM] kx9x#3778
so I would try 26, withdraw all


[06/27/2021 1:47 PM] kx9x#3778
or go to here https://etherscan.io/token/0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c#readContract:
15. balanceOf
Put in your address and then copy paste that number into the withdraw function with the matchShares parameter, #27


[06/27/2021 1:47 PM] kx9x#3778
which is basically how 26. withdraw works internally

Hey, how can I simulate how much of one asset I would get if i withdraw the LP tokens from tricrypto pool?


[06/28/2021 4:05 AM] Din#7271
also, how does it allow me to deposit USDC to the crvEURS pool? isn't it only EUR pool?


[06/28/2021 4:22 AM] j.#6352
Zapper is integrated


[06/28/2021 4:28 AM] Din#7271
What do you mean? where does it convert the USDC i deposited to EUR?


[06/28/2021 4:29 AM] j.#6352
zapper.fi contracts find routes to swap tokens if necessary


[06/28/2021 10:49 AM] mightypenguin#1126
If I exchange with Zapper how long until you can claim the Exchange weekly XP?


[06/28/2021 12:55 PM] kelvin1#2092
Is the APY listed for each vault gross or net of fees?


[06/28/2021 1:33 PM] j.#6352
net. hover over the number to find out more. hover over the 'growth' label on top for details

Im having an issues depositing on yearn with ledger/metamask.  I can depost link on the earn.  but when i try to do yvboost with ETh i press deposit and nothing happens


[06/28/2021 5:24 PM] vany#0365
due to a routing error we have disabled zapping into yvboost. with yvboost trading at a discount its a good idea to go to sushi.com and trade for it instead, if you are looking to own yvboost

You can do this on curve.fi go to the triCrypto pool withdrawal tab and put in how much you want to withdrawal and it will show you slippage

I wasn't speaking about slippage, I wanted to see how much of one asset I would withdraw if I withdraw now? Assume I have 50 tricrypto LP tokens.

I asked about this earlier but haven't been able to figure it out yet, responses from both XDefi and here said to clear cookies. I've tried to clear cookies and everything else, tried in it Chrome instead of Brave, and I only get the same message. I go to other dapps and it connects automatically. I've deposited into Yearn from this wallet before with Metamask injection, but I haven't been able to connect again for a while.

Great thing about wallets, you can transfer them


[06/30/2021 12:51 AM] arberx#3367
So if you simply make a metamask wallet with your private key (which you should never ever share!) you can connect with that


[06/30/2021 12:52 AM] Lazuli#9648
Use Xdefi private key to import in metamask?


[06/30/2021 12:53 AM] arberx#3367
Yeah I mean be careful but it’s a solution


[06/30/2021 12:53 AM] arberx#3367
Remember never share that key with anyone


[06/30/2021 12:54 AM] arberx#3367
Please do your research before you attempt it though


[06/30/2021 12:55 AM] arberx#3367
Or maybe ask in a xdefi discord


[06/30/2021 12:55 AM] arberx#3367
To see if they have any suggestions


[06/30/2021 12:55 AM] arberx#3367
On why it’s not connecting


[06/30/2021 1:04 AM] Lazuli#9648
Ok thanks I'll ask them if they would suggest importing into metamask. Xdefi has multiple chains in the same wallet besides ethereum so it may not be compatible but I'll see what they say.

Remove from pickle farm. Withdraw from jar. Go to sushi and remove from pool. Deposit the yvecrv into yvboost and then reverse the steps using yvboost back into pickle

if it has some of the deposit token sitting in the vault which you can check on etherscan then it has funds free

is my understanding

This doesn't appear to work anymore. I unstaked on yearn and the pickle migrate as well as the yearn step 2 appear to be broken. Not sure how to get from v1 backscratcher yvecrv/eth to yvboost/eth


[07/04/2021 2:33 AM] vany#0365
Not sure what part is broken but best to use pickle.finance to withdraw all the way then swap to yvboost if you want to go to yvboost/eth slp


[07/04/2021 2:55 AM] Mozzy#0093
Step 2 on yearn is broken. I clicked migrate a bunch of times. When my metamask does rarely pop open it has the error "exception thrown in contract". I also can't harvest and withdraw from pickle either. It's current pSLP so it's untradable and I can't remove liquidity on sushi. Also the migration on pickle is broken (perhaps because I did step 1 on yearn) and I get a failed tx.


[07/04/2021 2:56 AM] kx9x#3778
go to pickle.finance, check farms and click "SHow your Farms"


[07/04/2021 2:56 AM] kx9x#3778
if you see it there, then you need to harvest and exit or unstake


[07/04/2021 2:57 AM] kx9x#3778

anyone know how to change the Yearn UI from the old to the new 1.2.3. version? I had it for a bit but then it reverted back to the blue layout. Friend had the same issue and was told to "synchronize your wallet provider node to YFI host". Any help on how to do this?


[07/06/2021 12:54 PM] j.#6352
> synchronize your wallet provider node to YFI host
This is a typical scammer line


[07/06/2021 12:55 PM] j.#6352
yearn.finance is the only *official* url of Yearn


[07/06/2021 12:58 PM] Marcus Aurelius#0640
i figured so. so the official yearn interface is still the predominantly blue layout?


[07/06/2021 12:58 PM] j.#6352
yes


[07/06/2021 12:58 PM] j.#6352

[07/06/2021 12:58 PM] j.#6352
you might be looking for yearn.fi

the white one


[07/06/2021 12:59 PM] Marcus Aurelius#0640
ok is there any difference between the two


[07/06/2021 12:59 PM] j.#6352
but it's maintained by a different person


[07/06/2021 12:59 PM] Marcus Aurelius#0640
ah ok


[07/06/2021 12:59 PM] j.#6352
just the UI. contracts are still the same of course


[07/06/2021 1:00 PM] Marcus Aurelius#0640
ok. what spawned the creation of yearn.fi run by a different person?


[07/06/2021 1:00 PM] j.#6352
ape.tax is another one. i's say it's the experimental staging site before pushing live to yearn.finance


[07/06/2021 1:00 PM] j.#6352
no idea


[07/06/2021 1:00 PM] j.#6352

I had no trouble adding liquidity (ETH and USDC) to several Yearn V2 vaults a couple of months ago but now I can't seem to add or withdraw USDC to/from any of them.  I'm using Metamask paired with a Trezor wallet.  I've tried connecting directly to the Trezor but I have the same problem so it does not seem specific to Metamask. I also tried a several computer/browser combos with no luck. No matter what amount of USDC I try to deposit or withdraw the "contract interaction" on MM only shows 0 ETH, not the correct amount of USDC so I have to reject the transaction since I don't want to pay gas for what I assume is an empty transaction. The same zero transaction happens when I try to withdraw ETH.  

As you can see from the screenshot when I try to withdraw USDC from the USDC V2 vault the MM window shows 0 ETH instead of 500 USDC for the transaction amount.  

Any help you can give me would be much appreciated!

Did you not read the replies to your post on Reddit?


[07/07/2021 9:43 AM] j.#6352
You even acknowledged one of the comments with a reply


[07/07/2021 9:49 AM] DeanF#9764
Yes, I did.  I was told that this was the place for the most expert help and I wanted to see if anyone knew for sure what fix for the issue is before wasting a bunch of money on an empty transaction since gas fees are little higher now.


[07/07/2021 9:49 AM] j.#6352
I suggest you read through the comments again


[07/07/2021 1:53 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Nothing to fix there, you’re sending a call to a contract function hence there is not need of sending any ETH, that’s why it says “ 0 ETH”

💯 👍 

[07/07/2021 1:54 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Same to deposit in any vault except the wETH where you can deposit raw ETH and it should appear.

if the zap is down you should be able to withdraw the crvFRAX token then go to curve and withdraw the stable you want

[07/10/2021 4:48 PM] j.#6352
This is a Metamask thing. That field only shows ETH if there is any ETH transfer from your address. You are withdrawing USDC, which is a contract interaction, not an ETH transfer.

Hi, I have successfully deposited ETH into "yvBOOST-ETH" (v2) vault using yearn.finance website. I can see positive vault balance. However there is another input and button next to it labeled "Approve". What does it do? Should I use it to complete the process?


[07/10/2021 4:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok how do I withdraw then? I click withdraw and that should be it right? Buy I keep getting that error


[07/10/2021 4:56 PM] pawelpokrywka.eth#9030
I have compared smart contract data of using this "Approve" button on yearn.finance website to using "Approve and Stake" on pickle.finance. It appears they do the same thing. So I assume "Approve" is just a shortcut to perform the task without leaving Yearn.finance. Could someone confirm?


[07/10/2021 4:59 PM] pawelpokrywka.eth#9030
Do you have enough ETH on your account to pay for gas for withdrawal transaction? I suspect Metamask would display "not enough funds" error, but maybe in this case the error is somehow hidden.


[07/10/2021 5:00 PM] Deleted User#0000

try withdrawing from etherscan if you are still thinking it is a yearn thing


[07/10/2021 5:34 PM] kx9x#3778
to me it also looks like metamask just isn't actually transmitting your TX out


[07/10/2021 5:34 PM] kx9x#3778
otherwise you'd see a failure on chain and you'd lose some ETH due to gas


[07/10/2021 5:35 PM] kx9x#3778
and we'd see errors on the yvUSDC contract


[07/10/2021 5:35 PM] kx9x#3778
are your sure your address doesn't have any pending txs with low gas or something?


[07/10/2021 5:35 PM] j.#6352

interesting, wonder if it is a ledger thing


[07/10/2021 6:22 PM] kx9x#3778
if the TX is not leaving metamask, then I don't think there is much Yearn can do at that point since at that point the website already directed metamask which TX needed to be signed and then after that it seems like your TX isn't broadcasting to the network, which should be a metamask concern


[07/10/2021 6:23 PM] kx9x#3778
you can try yearn.fi instead, which is a community alt frontend run by Andre and Anton


[07/10/2021 6:23 PM] kx9x#3778

[07/14/2021 7:09 AM] mallie#3740
I googled it and found the following
"Metamask alert transaction error exception thrown in Contract Code
Generally speaking, "Exception is thrown in contract code" means exactly what it says - something in the contract blew up. We can advise you in this case to contact the owners of the contract, and developers to post in our forum and/or on the Ethereum stack exchange to seek help"


[07/14/2021 7:10 AM] mallie#3740
Ok thanks. Just saw your earlier reply.

Hello.


[07/14/2021 12:11 PM] minoru#4143
I have one question.


[07/14/2021 12:23 PM] minoru#4143
I did deposit eth to yvboost-eth  vault.


[07/14/2021 12:23 PM] minoru#4143
And now I want to withdraw it.


[07/14/2021 12:23 PM] minoru#4143
But have no idea how to do this?


[07/14/2021 12:24 PM] minoru#4143
Give me some advice, please.

[07/14/2021 12:24 PM] j.#6352
Do the reverse of the vault description. All of the details are listed there


[07/14/2021 12:26 PM] minoru#4143
I did withdraw from pickle.


[07/14/2021 12:27 PM] minoru#4143
So I returned back pSLP tokens.


[07/14/2021 12:27 PM] minoru#4143
But how could I return back my ETH from pSLP tokens?


[07/14/2021 12:28 PM] j.#6352
Since you withdrew from Pickle, I'll assume you have SLP now, and not pSLP


[07/14/2021 12:28 PM] j.#6352
you can use Zapper.fi or Zerion.io to exit to ETH


[07/14/2021 12:29 PM] j.#6352
or if you want to do it manually, go to Sushiswap to withdraw ETH and yvBOOST, then sell the yvBOOST for ETH


[07/14/2021 12:30 PM] minoru#4143

check etherscan


[07/14/2021 12:31 PM] j.#6352
metamask only displays tokens you add


[07/14/2021 12:31 PM] j.#6352
or zapper


[07/14/2021 12:31 PM] j.#6352
or zerion


[07/14/2021 12:31 PM] minoru#4143
Okay.


[07/14/2021 12:31 PM] minoru#4143
Let me check Zapper.fi first.


[07/14/2021 12:31 PM] minoru#4143
After trying, I will ping you with result.


[07/14/2021 12:31 PM] minoru#4143

Hello 🙂

How does one measure the performance for Lending (via Earn)?
I provided LINK for cyLINK, but I'm not sure how to track results.

It doesn't appear in the EARN page.

Moreover, the LINK vaults seem to exclude where I've deposited:

Of course, these screenshots are for the **Invest** section. Not the **Lend** section.
If we look at the **Lend** section, the assets are rightfully shown, but I see no way to track performance:

hey guys, is there a recent state of the vaults or other info on what's getting updated soon? I'm launching contracts using the tokens but see yvDAI is getting updated and am worried others will be soon too which will be a pain during launch


[07/15/2021 2:25 AM] pr1ntz#5696
I'm seeing several people here struggling with withdrawals from the sUSD vault. I'm having the same problem. When I try to withdraw and exception is thrown in the contract code. What is the problem here?

generally if a vault is lower than 3.5 we are updating it, and we would ideally like all vaults to be on 4.3, but this wont happen very soon for the newer ones


[07/15/2021 3:29 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
@ONI quick question, we need to migrate from v1 to v2 for our users using API, should we do a withdrawal and then quickly do a deposit? or there is a "migrate" API call we can use to do that


[07/15/2021 3:29 AM] Wallace Yan#0757
@ONI and also, if doing a withdraw and then deposit, the withdraw fee is still waived at this point?

Can you dm me?

Hey guys , So a new decentralized insurance protocol by the number of BUMPER , Liquidity Provision Kicked off yesterday , seems like a big hit. It became yUSDC vault V2 8th biggest TVL contributor in a single day. More then 5 million in deposits in less then 10 minutes since it's launch. Trying to solve the problem of price Fluctuations . Have a look https://app.bumper.fi/app/deposit , what do you guys think???

no prob in my case, but if anyone uses yearn because it was recommended as the easiest DeFi application, they might have switched vaults and paid (high) gas costs for no reason

yah that makes sense

Hello noob question here, as I encountered an issue while using yearn.finance for the first time. Summary of the issue: I deposited nearly 1 ETH into yearn, but now I cannot seem to see it. Detailed steps: 1. Connected yearn to my Metamask wallet 2. Opened up yvBoost-ETH wallet, changed dropdown to say ETH 3. Deposited and then approved deposit of 0.982 ETH.

fork and export to CSV if you have dune pro, those are the only deployers I know (there are probably more). Ancient contracts from early 2020 are from Andre but maybe not all are 100% related with yearn https://duneanalytics.com/queries/83306

asking me to migrate**


[07/17/2021 9:47 PM] kx9x#3778
are you sure you didn't just confirm the approve TX and then not actually migrate?


[07/17/2021 10:05 PM] blockunle#6550
Possible. This migration is a two function on chain? I only got one notification/transaction on meta. Would you recommend doing it again?


[07/17/2021 10:10 PM] kx9x#3778
You have to approve the migrator to spend your vault token


[07/17/2021 10:10 PM] kx9x#3778
And then run the migrate function


[07/17/2021 10:10 PM] kx9x#3778

[07/19/2021 12:07 AM] Nishant#3974
Has anyone noticed something wrong with the yearn portal ? 
I am trying to withdraw from one of the vaults, however each transaction always auto assigns 
a ridiculous gas limit. Ex: `14222156` . Obviously I can change it back to a reasonable amount, but I have
never encountered this before, so wondered if this was a new bug introduced.


[07/19/2021 12:19 AM] vany#0365
that typically is the wallet telling you the tx will fail


[07/19/2021 12:19 AM] vany#0365
could be an approval issue or a tx issue. you can try to withdraw via yearn.fi or zapper.fi and see if the wallet gives you the same issue


[07/19/2021 12:39 AM] Nishant#3974
If i understand the flow correctly, wouldn't the yearn site be providing the wallet would the transaction parameters ? Afaik, metamask doesn't usually set the gas limit.


[07/19/2021 12:39 AM] Nishant#3974
I tried yearn.fi and got the same issue @vany


[07/19/2021 12:39 AM] Nishant#3974
If it helps, it was the USDC vault.


[07/19/2021 12:42 AM] Nishant#3974
Zapper.fi doesn't have the same issue though


[07/19/2021 12:49 AM] vany#0365
MM is set up to max out gas limit on a TX as a way to show it will fail


[07/19/2021 12:59 AM] Nishant#3974
Thanks @vany , wasn't aware of that. Also pretty bad UX, but in any case now I know the reason.

The major holder of yearn TrueUSD has recently withdrawn 2.2M of tokens, which was about over 90% of the total supply

Looks like all v1 funds will come back to the vaults, therefore it can’t be cheaper to finally withdraw


[07/19/2021 10:16 AM] ONI#6888
Yes, best to wait till we announce this has happened before withdrawing so you are not hit with a withdrawal fee


[07/19/2021 10:17 AM] moreno#2026

my funds are gone from the front-end of yearn, can see them on zapper but not on the yearn site itself, any guidance on this issue?

Try hard refreshing the page and making sure your correct wallet is connected


[07/21/2021 6:14 AM] SuperMilkDaddy#6661
Beginner question: I contributed to the AAVE pool in curve.fi (aDAI+aUSDC+aUSDT) a while back. I just noticed on yearn.finance that it recognizes my contribution by showing the same amount under "Available to Deposit" for the crvAAVE vault. Can I really deposit this or will it affect my original curve.fi aave pool? 

My wallet shows this amount listed as `a3CRV` FYI. Again, just trying to learn more so any clarification/help is greatly appreciated!


[07/21/2021 6:28 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
You can deposit the a3crv tokens in the vault to start farming CRV.


[07/21/2021 7:08 AM] ONI#6888
^ yes you can and probably should deposit it to yearn. You are currently not staking your a3CRV thus not earning any CRV as rewards. All your earning as of now is the best pool swap fees which is usually under 1%.


[07/21/2021 3:25 PM] Trowa (👑, 👑)#8608
Noob question - i zapped 122 USDC into the yvBoost - ETH vault about 20 hours ago and i can see the transaction completed in etherscan but the UI on yearn does not reflect the deposit amount. Any clue why? 0x12596be41c511821c1e831f2c6ea1226390af4235c5937174c847858b6a1f5f1

after zap you still need to stake at pickle


[07/21/2021 4:09 PM] Trowa (👑, 👑)#8608
right but i should still have something noting the initial deposit amount on yearn i would think


[07/21/2021 4:42 PM] vany#0365
we only show one balance and the directions tell you to stake. best for balance to show when you have finished all the steps

thanks - doing that now


[07/21/2021 8:05 PM] SuperMilkDaddy#6661
Thanks, @Richard Feynmann and @ONI ! So, if I'm understanding correctly, my initial deposit into the AAVE curve.fi pool allows me to collect rewards on curve.fi *and* allows me to deposit a3CRV into yearn.finance, which collect additional rewards? Sounds like a good deal!

Would it have been any different had I just directly deposited into yearn.finance crvAAVE instead? Or am I really benefiting from both as mentioned above? I really need to better understand the relationship between yearn and curve.


[07/21/2021 8:10 PM] vany#0365
its basically the same thing, if you did it on yearn it just would be batched as one transaction instead of you doing the manual steps


[07/21/2021 8:10 PM] vany#0365
but you still get the same results with a slight difference in gas costs


[07/21/2021 8:13 PM] SuperMilkDaddy#6661
Ah, okay. So in essence I can ignore the curve.yi step and just directly contributed via yearn.finance. I made the contribution to curve.fi (which seems to be collecting some rewards according to the curve pool, if I'm not mistaken), but just recently noticed that I had this a3CRV coin that wasn't put to use according to yearn.finance crvAAVE asset.


[07/21/2021 8:22 PM] SuperMilkDaddy#6661
Another question about yearn.finance... Let's say I'm interested in the `crvTricrypto` vault and I only have `ETH` to deposit. `ETH` would be my "underlying asset", correct? And after investing into the `crvTricrypto` vault for some time and I later wish to widthdraw from the vault, it states that "withdrawals return the vault's underlying token or zap out into one fo the five supported tokens." Does this mean that I would get `ETH` returned to me?

My guess behind the scenes is that I'll have some `crvTricrypto` LP tokens while invested into the vault for some time, and behind the scenes those LP tokens will earn some returns, which will ultimately be converted back to my "underlying asset" (`ETH` in this example). Does that sound right?


[07/21/2021 8:33 PM] vany#0365
to earn full rewards you need to deposit into the pool and then stake it to earn curve. you can stake on your own or you can deposit into yearn who will stake it for you and provide boosted rewards vs minimum rewards


[07/21/2021 8:36 PM] vany#0365
when you deposit into a pool you no longer hold just eth, you hold eth/wbtc/usdt in equal parts, no longer just eth. so you will earn pool fees and curve rewards but your value is based on all 3 tokens and not just eth.


[07/21/2021 8:36 PM] SuperMilkDaddy#6661
Seems like depositing directly via yearn.finance is the easiest route with minimal complexity and (probably) cheaper gas fees associated. Nice! Wish I had known about this!


[07/21/2021 8:36 PM] vany#0365
yes it can save some gas by batching it into one tx


[07/21/2021 9:02 PM] SuperMilkDaddy#6661
Very helpful! So, after depositing into `crvTricrypto` via Yearn, do I need to do anything else? It sounds like Yearn does all the staking for me on my behalf, so I just sit back and hope for good returns? Do you generally just deposit directly via Yearn? I understand there is a management fee with Yearn but probably worth it.


[07/21/2021 9:04 PM] vany#0365
once its in there is nothing you need to do. its just important to know there is IL risk (impermanent loss). also the apy you see is after yearn fees and we provide boosted rewards with the locked curve

[07/23/2021 12:40 AM] CEEJ#4988
How do I get them over?  If I remove from the pickle jar, I recieve SLP in my wallet. It doesn't appear that any Farm on Pickle allows me to directly stake SLP.


[07/23/2021 12:42 AM] vany#0365
Once you have pSLP you have to go to the farm page and you then stake there


[07/23/2021 12:46 AM] CEEJ#4988
Found it, thanks man. Didn't realize I had pSLP.  Working now.


[07/23/2021 12:48 AM] CEEJ#4988
Assuming one day I want to go all the way back to ETH....whats the workflow look like there?  If I Harvest and Exit, I assume the pSLP goes back to my wallet.  And then I can pull the SLP from the Pickle Jar.  Once I have SLP, I'm a little lost as how to get that liquidity back in ETH.


[07/23/2021 12:58 AM] arberx#3367

[07/23/2021 1:50 PM] j.#6352
If youre asking about the pools/pairs, they're all the same. If youre asking about the mechanics of yvBOOST-ETH with Pickle, that's completely different


[07/23/2021 1:51 PM] j.#6352
You should find the yvBOOST-ETH pool in the Yield tab in Sushiswap

@j. - What are the underlying assets?


[07/23/2021 3:26 PM] j.#6352
unstake on pickle if you staked, then withdraw to get your SLP back. From here, you can either zap out to whatever token you want from zapper.fi or zerion.io, or do it manually by going to sushiswap to withdraw to get yvBOOST and ETH


[07/23/2021 3:26 PM] j.#6352
of what?


[07/23/2021 3:47 PM] doger#9213
yvboost


[07/23/2021 3:47 PM] j.#6352
underlying is yvecrv


[07/23/2021 3:48 PM] doger#9213
oh ok so basically crv rewards


[07/23/2021 3:48 PM] doger#9213
prob better palces to put crv than this at 25%


[07/23/2021 3:48 PM] doger#9213
Doesnt CVX pay like 50%


[07/23/2021 3:50 PM] j.#6352
yup. autocompounding 3crv claims


[07/23/2021 3:51 PM] j.#6352
buying yvecrv is recommended over locking crv 1:1 as yvecrv is cheaper to buy

pretty sure. we were getting 25% in the yvboost pool

What was the answer?  My question aboved stemmed from the same thing.


[07/23/2021 10:11 PM] kx9x#3778
vault tokens maintain a price per share


[07/23/2021 10:11 PM] kx9x#3778
when you withdraw, you get back what you put in plus any appreciation from that price per share going up


[07/23/2021 10:12 PM] kx9x#3778
so if you deposited 10 ETH at a price per share of 1.1, you'd get 9.091 vault tokens as your shares


[07/23/2021 10:12 PM] kx9x#3778
if you withdraw later at a price per share of 1.2, you'd get 9.091 * 1.2 = 10.909 eth back


[07/23/2021 10:15 PM] Choice#0279
Gotcha.  Thanks for the explanation

1. used yearn yvBoost with 1eth and receieved 19 yvboost-eth, 2. depostied same into the Vault. 3. 19 backscratcher pSLP yvBOOST on Pickle Interface staked. 4. Sushi Swap yvboost-weth farm there is ZERO Balacne. 5. QUESTION: I understood the Vault allows for staking on Pickle Farm and Sushi Farm, is this correct? 6. if so why can not i not see a balance on sushi Farm of my staked tokens as it says in the Yearn Platfrom the Zap product was supposed to take my 1 eth and stake it also on Sushi Farm???? 7. Thiis my first use so forgive my ignorance


[07/25/2021 2:26 PM] j.#6352
Your tokens are not in Sushiswap. They are in Pickle. Depositing in yvBOOST-ETH on the Yearn website will do what the description says. So, you should see your tokens/deposit in Pickle. Go to app.pickle.finance


[07/25/2021 2:50 PM] AvgJoe#0408
thank you for your reply, as I said in point number 3 i see 19tokens in Pckle farm, the yearn vault description pt number 2 i read into it as I would see the staking also on sushi, but I suppose that is part of the transaction process to get to pickle that it passes through sushi swap.


[07/25/2021 2:55 PM] j.#6352

go to https://app.pickle.finance/farms and harvest and exit.

then go to the Jars page and withdraw

then go to https://app.sushi.com/pool and withdraw

Hi All,

Have been doing research to learn more about Yearn/Curve over the past few days but have a few questions that I haven't been able to pinpoint answers to related to yvBOOST.

Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction of understanding these?

In summary, I understand Yearn harvests 3Crv LP Tokens weekly, but don't understand how they are then "swapped for more yveCRV-DAO (either via market-buy or mint, depending on which is most efficient at time of harvest)" as is stated in the 'State of the Vaults' document.

1) Where are 3Crv LP Tokens able to be swapped for yveCRV? Am assuming this would be a process of depositing 3Crv back into the LP, claiming DAI/USDC/USDT, then trading those for WETH/CRV and then yveCRV (only liquidity pools that seem to exist for yveCRV)?
2) If yveCRV is minted, what happens to the 3Crv tokens? Assuming they get deposited back into the LP for DAI/USDC/USDT then traded for CRV which is then locked for veCRV to serve as the underlying asset of the minted yveCRV?
3) Once these yveCRV tokens are obtained via swapping/minting and deposited back into the vault, do they get distributed equally among the vault participants, so that the vault participants amount of yveCRV in the vault goes up over time (hence investing 100 yveCRV at 20% APY over a year would result in 120 yveCRV at year end)?
4) If yveCRV tokens are withdrawn from the vault, is it correct to say that they no longer accrue value in any way aside from the value of the underlying veCRV tokens they represent? In other words, yveCRV tokens that are not locked in a vault do not earn 3Crv rewards, given these 3Crv rewards are only distributed to yveCRV token holders who have their tokens locked in the vault?

If this isn't the right place for these types of questions, would appreciate anyone letting me know the appropriate place for them!


[07/25/2021 11:21 PM] ONI#6888
yvBoost vault just claims weekly rewards 3crv, swaps for crv, and deposits to the yveCRV vault. Increase your balance of yveCRV.


[07/25/2021 11:25 PM] ONI#6888
Am assuming this would be a process of depositing 3Crv back into the LP. 3crv is a lp token


[07/25/2021 11:25 PM] ONI#6888
so you just withdrawal to the stable you want


[07/25/2021 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks @ONI.

So correct to say anyone who withdraws yveCRV from the vault will not be gaining rewards that come from 3Crv?


[07/25/2021 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because rewards are paid back to token holders who have yveCRV locked in the vault?


[07/25/2021 11:27 PM] ONI#6888
you cannot withdrawal from yveCRV


[07/25/2021 11:27 PM] ONI#6888
since your locking crv to veCRV


[07/25/2021 11:27 PM] ONI#6888
you can **sell** your yveCRV or the more liquid asset yvBOOST


[07/25/2021 11:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I understand. If I withdraw from the yvBOOST vault, I'm not withdrawing yveCRV, I'm actually withdrawing yvBOOST?


[07/25/2021 11:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hence why says on the vault page "Withdraw yvBOOST denominated to yveCRV"


[07/25/2021 11:30 PM] ONI#6888
Ok so here is how it works


[07/25/2021 11:31 PM] ONI#6888
h/t @wavey


[07/25/2021 11:31 PM] ONI#6888
yveCRV takes 3crv gained and chooses either: 
1. buy yvboost from market
2. buy CRV and deposit to backscratcher (aka yveCRV yVault)


[07/25/2021 11:32 PM] ONI#6888
if #1 is chosen, the sequence goes:

- unwrap 3crv rewards to usdc
- sell usdc for yvBOOST (thru weth pair)
- withdraw yvBOOST from vault for yveCRV


[07/25/2021 11:38 PM] ONI#6888

Thanks. That clarified a fair bit but thrown for a loop on 'withdraw yvBOOST from vault for yveCRV' as final step of option 1.

Shouldn't the yvBOOST that is bought be deposited into the vault?


[07/25/2021 11:49 PM] wavey#9439
the vault's `want` is yveCRV, not yvBOOST 🙂


[07/25/2021 11:50 PM] wavey#9439
i.e. the vault only accepts yveCRV ... cannot deposit yvBOOST which are actually the vault shares.


[07/25/2021 11:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
If yveCRV cannot be withdrawn from the vault, how can it be deposited?


[07/25/2021 11:52 PM] wavey#9439
I was responding to your question about why not deposit yvBOOST into the vault.


[07/25/2021 11:53 PM] ONI#6888
CRV cannot be unstaked from the yveCRV vault


[07/25/2021 11:53 PM] wavey#9439
yveCRV can be withdrawn from yvBOOST, yes


[07/25/2021 11:53 PM] ONI#6888
yvBoost is not yveCRV vault


[07/25/2021 11:53 PM] ONI#6888
crv locks to veCRV


[07/25/2021 11:53 PM] ONI#6888
for yearn vaults


[07/25/2021 11:54 PM] ONI#6888
you deposit crv to yveCRV yVault, then you can deposit that vault token to yvBOOST


[07/25/2021 11:54 PM] ONI#6888
yveCRV yVault lets you get weekly 3crv, yvBOOST autoclaims and compounds them back into yveCRV


[07/25/2021 11:55 PM] ONI#6888
so if you just hold yveCRV you can claim your weekly 3crv and build up 3crv.


[07/25/2021 11:55 PM] ONI#6888
but you cannot withdrawal from yveCRV (only sell it on the market, even if that price is lower than what the share price should be). You can withdrawal yveCRV from yvBOOST.


[07/26/2021 2:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks @ONI and @wavey, that is really helpful.

Would that imply then that, all else being equal, the value of yveCRV and yvBOOST tokens would increase over time as the value locked in the vaults continues to compound?


[07/26/2021 2:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Idea being the same 1 token represents 20% more veCRV a year later assuming APY is 20%?


[07/26/2021 2:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or perhaps, in other words, the goal of these two vaults is to continuously accrue as much veCRV as possible, with the APY representing the amount of veCRV that the vaults will acquire per year?


[07/26/2021 2:59 AM] ONI#6888
yvBoost will increase weekly with harvests. yveCRV increases from the 10% of farmed crv from yearn vaults that is locked in it.


[07/26/2021 3:02 AM] ONI#6888
yvBOOST APY: the increase in yveCRV you gain from weekly CRV rewards. Based on weekly harvest annualized.


[07/26/2021 3:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks @ONI. To confirm, is it correct that the APY here indicates that I would not get more tokens but that the value of those tokens would increase?


[07/26/2021 3:17 AM] ONI#6888
which `tokens` are you talking about?

*assuming I hold them separately


[07/26/2021 3:21 AM] ONI#6888
the APY is % you gain deposit token over a year.

both will increase in value

[07/26/2021 3:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Think I understand now


[07/26/2021 3:22 AM] ONI#6888
yveCRV is if you want 3crv, yvBOOST is if you want to compound that reward into more locked crv


[07/26/2021 3:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
yvBOOST -> I can convert this back to yveCRV and get a greater amount of yveCRV out than I first put in based on APY

yveCRV -> I cannot convert this back to CRV however the value of my yveCRV should increase because Yearn is depositing 10% of all CRV earned through the protocol into the vault. This also gives me weekly 3Crv rewards that I can harvest.

When I click on the vault, and select all funds to withdraw, it seems to want to send it as YETH, but I don't think that will work if I send to an ETH wallet.   Does any one have step by step on how to convert back to ETH, and then withdraw from vault?  thanks

Hello. I was checking out Yearn's crvSTETH vault and I noticed its APY is only 4.73%. I did the math (which can obviously be wrong) on the APY I would get by just holding crvSTETH, which included stETH's staking APY and Curve stETH pool's base and rewards APY (CRV and LDO), and it should come to 9.56%. Shouldn't the two strategies have similar APYs?


[07/26/2021 9:32 PM] vany#0365
on https://yearn.finance you should be able to open the vault you are in  and on the withdraw side, open a dropdown and select ETH. when you withdraw it will put the ETH back into your wallet


[07/27/2021 5:22 AM] Garry#9858
Good afternoon, tell me, the sUSD pool, when withdrawing from it in another asset, gives the error " Zap Failed. This means there is not enough liquidity for this token or Zapper may be down." If you withdraw to sUSD, it puts a large commission for withdrawal. What's it?


[07/27/2021 6:16 AM] j.#6352
Are you asking about the 'large commission'? Withdrawing an amount larger than what's available will have to grab from funds in active strats

Hi @vany , I see you've answered previous questions about `crvTricrypto`. After seeing that Curve have now launched tricrypto2 pool. just wanted to know if there's a plan for:
-  the vault to automatically migrate underlying tokens to v2 once-off, or
- it's not going to happen, we need to withdraw manually and wait for a new vault (if as a user we have a pool preference)
- the vault to automatically migrate between both pools (v1-v2) as an strategy, or
- something else?
Thanks a lot!

The return is so small. 1.58 SNX in 2  months?

  Do you think return will go up a bunch of SNX price goes up a bunch? Or is the Yearn Vault  pretty much dead for a decent return?

they just represent your share in the vault


[07/30/2021 4:15 PM] kx9x#3778
at withdrawal time, you exchange these back for SNX

[07/30/2021 4:15 PM] kx9x#3778
you can actually use these as collateral to mint USDP


[07/30/2021 4:15 PM] discordtime#9786
Richard -  can you elaborate on what you mean by this? Do you mean , you will recognize a return until after 1 year?


[07/30/2021 4:15 PM] kx9x#3778
and then you can farm using the USDP or swap toa nother stable and farm


[07/30/2021 4:16 PM] kx9x#3778
so you will still be yielding with the SNX vault but also be able to farm with the borrowed stables on top of it


[07/30/2021 4:16 PM] kx9x#3778
just need to make sure you keep your loan health well as SNX value changes


[07/30/2021 4:16 PM] kx9x#3778
I am trying to figure out why the vault hasn't moved in like a month


[07/30/2021 4:18 PM] discordtime#9786
Thank you. Yeah seems odd to me. It had like a 67% APY ... but seems it went under 1%.


[07/30/2021 4:22 PM] kx9x#3778
for some weeks it was yielding 0, now it should be back to business


[07/30/2021 4:22 PM] kx9x#3778
last harvest was 2 days ago and the price per share did bump up a little


[07/30/2021 4:26 PM] kx9x#3778
the problem is that since SNX price was crushed so much, the fees had to go into maintaining the lending ratio rather than towards yield


[07/30/2021 4:26 PM] kx9x#3778
since SNX is finally rising, the susd minting strategy should perform better


[07/30/2021 4:29 PM] kx9x#3778
the strategists also added universe staking as a strat not long ago


[07/30/2021 4:29 PM] kx9x#3778
currently at a 5% ratio for the funds, might scale up if that yields well


[07/30/2021 4:29 PM] kx9x#3778
so the vault is in a better place than 2 weeks ago for sure


[07/30/2021 8:56 PM] discordtime#9786
Thanks a bunch


[07/30/2021 8:58 PM] discordtime#9786
Do you think that website you sent me showed me an accurate full return for the whole 2 months? 

Even if the last two weeks have been bad it seems like I would have earned more than 1.58 SNX on 500 SNX over 2 months .

Just trying to figure out what I might be missing?


[07/30/2021 8:59 PM] discordtime#9786
Also is there a website that will tell you the "strategy"that's  employed to generate the return or is that private?

Trying to figure out the strategy this fault uses to generate return .

Much thanks


[07/30/2021 8:59 PM] discordtime#9786
Thanks for all the answers


[07/30/2021 9:58 PM] ONI#6888
Staked SNX doesnt unlock for a year so those rewards are not counted in the vault apy, but are counted on SNX's staking site


[07/30/2021 9:59 PM] ONI#6888
For staked SNX yes, but the vault also farms with its debt that is created from staking, so for now that is providing the return on the vault via the sUSD vault.

I am having trouble zapping into the yvBoost - ETH vault


[07/30/2021 10:27 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
I have connected my Metamask wallet, and have Zapper open and connected as well


[07/30/2021 10:27 PM] ONI#6888
your using zapper.fi for the zap?


[07/30/2021 10:28 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
It allows me to see my ETH balance in yearn.finance/vaults but when I click Deposit nothing happens


[07/30/2021 10:28 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
I have zapper.fi open and connected to my wallet.  Should I be using the zapper interface to deposit into the Yearn vault?


[07/30/2021 10:29 PM] ONI#6888
the yvboost-eth is a zap into pickle's farm, it is not a yearn vault


[07/30/2021 10:29 PM] ONI#6888
Yes I would try to use zapper.fi interface completely on that one


[07/30/2021 10:29 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
So do I need to connect my wallet on pickly ?


[07/30/2021 10:29 PM] ONI#6888
no


[07/30/2021 10:29 PM] ONI#6888
zapper.fi


[07/30/2021 10:29 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
Okay, I couldn't seem to find the yvboost-eth on zapper


[07/30/2021 10:30 PM] ONI#6888
Yearn.Finance limits slippage on all zaps to 1% so if slippage is more it wont go through


[07/30/2021 10:30 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
I see, that may be what is happening.  It worked one time but the gas fee was aggressive so I canceled it


[07/30/2021 10:30 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
Where on zapper.fi should I be looking?


[07/30/2021 10:32 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
If the deposit failed because slippage was more than the allowed 1% would it notify me in some way, or just do nothing?


[07/30/2021 10:36 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069
Is there a resource you could point me towards on how to use zapper with yearn?


[07/30/2021 10:36 PM] ONI#6888

yes zap into pickle farm


[07/30/2021 10:42 PM] ONI#6888
which uses a yearn vault yvBOOST, and ETH deposited into sushiswap


[07/30/2021 10:42 PM] ONI#6888
to farm sushi

probably a problem with zapper.fi can you try it again on yearn and open up the console


[07/30/2021 10:47 PM] Carter💰🎮💰#0069

hi how can i interact with the ibeur/eth staking fosset for ibff?


[08/01/2021 4:08 AM] ONI#6888
I dont think a UI for this has been released yet


[08/01/2021 8:47 AM] Amin#9133
There seems to be a problem with the recognition of depositable assets. Yesterday i tried to deposit crvFrax but the yearn.finance interface would not recognize the crvFrax in my wallet. Today the same thing but with 3crv. I have 3crv in my wallet. Wallet is connected but yearn.finance shows available balance for deposit 0. I did soft refresh, hard refresh, compared contract address for underlying assets and everything seems right, except i can't deposit using the interface. I can zap in using usdc or others but at 1% slippage settings that's just ludicrously expensive especially considering that i already have 3crv available


[08/01/2021 8:55 AM] Amin#9133
I am also unable to see or withdraw my crvPBTC or crvRETH yearn vault holdings. Same thing vault tokens are in my wallet but do not show as withdrawable asset on yearn.finance. They do show in trackavault and zapper and able to withdraw from there but prefer using yearn interface directly. Any help is appreciated


[08/01/2021 10:53 AM] GC23997#6415
Same problem there, tried clearing cashe and restarting, is there any other UI


[08/01/2021 1:57 PM] ONI#6888

Is there any way to get the historical performance of the vaults / coins ?


[08/02/2021 8:11 AM] Jihoon#3260
I want to stake CRV in vault. 

1. Stake CRV in yveCRV vault  : can get yveCRV and 15 % apy in 3CRV.

2. Stake yveCRV from 1. in yvboost vault : can get 15% and auto compounded. 

3. If i want to return my asset, i can withdraw from yvboost.

Is this right?


[08/02/2021 8:27 AM] j.#6352
Looks correct, but check the prices of yveCRV and yvBOOST on Sushiswap. It's usually cheaper to buy yveCRV or yvBOOST than to deposit CRV 1:1


[08/02/2021 8:28 AM] ONI#6888
You can withdrawal yveCRV from yvBOOST, but you have to sell yveCRV on the market, can't withdrawal from the vault.


[08/02/2021 8:38 AM] Jihoon#3260
I did no know that! Then , If i buy yveCRV directly, i can only use yvboost vault. Because yveCRV vault need CRV. Is this right?


[08/02/2021 8:40 AM] ONI#6888
or you can buy yvBOOST on sushi


[08/02/2021 8:42 AM] Jihoon#3260
If i buy yvboost, can i use yvboost vault? because it needs yveCRVs


[08/02/2021 8:55 AM] Jihoon#3260
And i want to use both yveCRV(15% apy) vault and yvboost vault(15% apy). In this,  do I have to buy 'CRV' and can i get 30% apy?


[08/02/2021 8:56 AM] ONI#6888
no you get 15%


[08/02/2021 8:56 AM] ONI#6888
you can either buy crv or buy yvboost on sushiswap


[08/02/2021 8:56 AM] ONI#6888
usually its cheaper to buy yvboost on sushiswap


[08/02/2021 8:56 AM] ONI#6888
or you can buy it via a dex aggregator like matcha.xyz


[08/02/2021 9:00 AM] j.#6352
By buying yvBOOST, you *should* get the gains from yveCRV as this is compounded in the yvBOOST vault. No need to buy CRV. Buy the yvBOOST tokens directly


[08/02/2021 9:02 AM] j.#6352
Here are the prices for yveCRV and yvBOOST:

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yvboost


[08/02/2021 9:07 AM] Jihoon#3260
Why get 15% ? I stake CRV in yvecrv vault + stake yvecrv(from yvecrv vault by staking) in yvboost vault at the same time. Cant 15 + 15  ?


[08/02/2021 9:07 AM] Jihoon#3260
Thank you


[08/02/2021 9:10 AM] j.#6352
15% for either. I've been told this:
> difference is:
> - automates weekly claiming of 3crv
> - automates the selling of 3crv for more yveCRV


[08/02/2021 9:17 AM] Jihoon#3260
Ah I mean 15% either, too. I miss understood your word as only 15%. thank you!
Then, Which do you prefer between 'buying crv, get 15% for either' or 'buying yveCRV or yvboost directly and get only one 15%, not either' ?


[08/02/2021 9:18 AM] j.#6352
I'd personally pick yvBOOST so that I won't have to manually claim 3crv rewards each time with yveCRV


[08/02/2021 9:23 AM] Jihoon#3260

says that v1 vaults are sunsetted. is this true for yTUSD too? The withdrawal fee is still over 300 bucks atm


[08/02/2021 9:48 AM] j.#6352
Wasnt this just answered in #🏦vaults?


[08/02/2021 9:55 AM] moreno#2026
nope it wasn't, yes there is a new vault crvTUSD .
yet the funds in the yTUSD vault are still invested, there is 0 available for withdrawal. A withdrawal transaction triggers the strategy to withdraw funds from curve.


[08/02/2021 9:58 AM] moreno#2026
the announcement says vaults have been 'divested from the strategies'. is this true for yTUSD?

Do you see it?


[08/02/2021 12:28 PM] Citra Zing#0212
hi there, I'm trying to wrap my head around how yearn works. However, after reviewing the support documents, I thought I'd ask here. I recently deposited some DAI to the yearn vault. Once I deposit is there a way to see the growth on the interest?


[08/02/2021 12:28 PM] j.#6352
See #🔗links for dashboards and calculators


[08/02/2021 12:31 PM] Citra Zing#0212
@j. thank you! ok so i might not see anything yet if i deposited in the past couple of days


[08/02/2021 12:31 PM] j.#6352
yup


[08/02/2021 12:32 PM] j.#6352
!faq harvest frequency

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[08/02/2021 12:33 PM] Citra Zing#0212
thank you!

real easy for people to just copy your server nickname and number, which is why I just use my discord name for my server nickname


[08/02/2021 2:40 PM] kx9x#3778
so they can at least not copy my exact name or something that looks correct


[08/02/2021 2:54 PM] vany#0365
number not so much. can only customize that if you pay for nitro


[08/02/2021 2:54 PM] vany#0365
but still better to DM us first by clicking names on sidebar


[08/02/2021 2:57 PM] kx9x#3778
still easy tbh. takes like $5 and you can use that to scam thousands


[08/02/2021 3:04 PM] vany#0365
i have not come across a scammer using nitro yet but i agree its not hard


[08/02/2021 3:28 PM] LionHeart#0637
Where do i go to migrate yfi v1 vault to v2?


[08/02/2021 3:38 PM] LionHeart#0637
nvm. I was on yearn.fi. I went to yearn.finance and now see the migrate option

its too short apparently 😦


[08/03/2021 12:26 AM] d352cg2#7175
So how long does it take to migrate from v1 to v2?


[08/03/2021 12:30 AM] j.#6352
Should be as soon as your transaction is confirmed


[08/03/2021 12:31 AM] d352cg2#7175
K, I am not sure if the transaction is formed right.  Just has a fee


[08/03/2021 12:31 AM] d352cg2#7175
But it has confirmed


[08/03/2021 12:34 AM] d352cg2#7175
Still not migrated


[08/03/2021 12:38 AM] d352cg2#7175
Would a transaction or something like that help


[08/03/2021 12:38 AM] d352cg2#7175
?


[08/03/2021 12:38 AM] d352cg2#7175
Or is there a better place to ask questions?


[08/03/2021 12:38 AM] j.#6352
can you send me the etherscan link to the transaction so i can take a look?


[08/03/2021 12:39 AM] d352cg2#7175
DM or general chat?


[08/03/2021 12:40 AM] j.#6352
This is just the approval transaction. You'll have to do another transaction which does the actual transfer of tokens


[08/03/2021 12:41 AM] d352cg2#7175
So do the same again?


[08/03/2021 12:41 AM] j.#6352
yup


[08/03/2021 12:41 AM] d352cg2#7175
It still says ETH0


[08/03/2021 12:41 AM] j.#6352
it should be a similar action to when you deposited in the vault, approval then deposit


[08/03/2021 12:41 AM] j.#6352
Metamask?


[08/03/2021 12:41 AM] d352cg2#7175
Ledger


[08/03/2021 12:42 AM] j.#6352
I don't use Ledger, but if it works similar to Metamask, it only displays ETH value when you transfer ETH from your address. This transaction youre doing is transferring vault tokens


[08/03/2021 12:43 AM] d352cg2#7175
Ya it is doing a contract, just spent a fair amount on fees with nothing happening so far, but will try again


[08/03/2021 12:44 AM] d352cg2#7175
To be clear, not on this exactly.  I tried several times to deposit in V2 and it would not work.  Was able to in V1, but now not sure the Migrate will work.  Will keep trying though


[08/03/2021 12:45 AM] j.#6352
Make sure contract interaction is enabled in Ledger. I remember reading somewhere that that's a thing in Ledgers


[08/03/2021 12:45 AM] d352cg2#7175
Yup it is. I will double check the setting is still on. Thanks


[08/03/2021 12:45 AM] j.#6352
I also recommend interfacing with Metamask


[08/03/2021 12:45 AM] d352cg2#7175
Failing this, I will move some funds that way.


[08/03/2021 12:47 AM] d352cg2#7175
It worked and instantly that try.  Who knows, it is done. Thanks again

[08/03/2021 2:16 AM] hedgehog#6420
hi. got approved for 5$ but trying to deposit wanted thousands in gas


[08/03/2021 2:16 AM] hedgehog#6420
using metamask and yearn.finance


[08/03/2021 2:17 AM] ONI#6888
Which vault?


[08/03/2021 2:17 AM] hedgehog#6420
tried a couple


[08/03/2021 2:17 AM] ONI#6888
This means error trx wont go through usually


[08/03/2021 2:17 AM] ONI#6888
is it red?


[08/03/2021 2:18 AM] ONI#6888
do you have enough eth in your wallet?


[08/03/2021 2:18 AM] hedgehog#6420
the dia vault asking for 14236085 gas


[08/03/2021 2:20 AM] hedgehog#6420
thats 14million


[08/03/2021 2:20 AM] ONI#6888
Yes


[08/03/2021 2:20 AM] ONI#6888
^


[08/03/2021 2:20 AM] ONI#6888
you might need at least 50$ worth of eth, > 100$ worth is best


[08/03/2021 2:21 AM] hedgehog#6420
1600$ seems a bit much


[08/03/2021 2:21 AM] ONI#6888
no that is an error


[08/03/2021 2:21 AM] ONI#6888
do you have over 100$ of eth in your wallet


[08/03/2021 2:21 AM] hedgehog#6420
thats what i thought


[08/03/2021 2:21 AM] ONI#6888
you can cancel that trx


[08/03/2021 2:21 AM] hedgehog#6420
surely


[08/03/2021 2:22 AM] hedgehog#6420
but why would it populate that value wrong?


[08/03/2021 2:22 AM] ONI#6888
just ignore it


[08/03/2021 2:22 AM] ONI#6888
metamask error codes suck


[08/03/2021 2:22 AM] hedgehog#6420
i must specify some gas limit


[08/03/2021 2:22 AM] ONI#6888
If you have over 100$ in eth in your wallet


[08/03/2021 2:22 AM] hedgehog#6420
like 100 000


[08/03/2021 2:22 AM] ONI#6888
then I would disconnect


[08/03/2021 2:23 AM] ONI#6888
clear your cookies


[08/03/2021 2:23 AM] hedgehog#6420
ahh thanks


[08/03/2021 2:23 AM] ONI#6888
hit cntl+shfit+r


[08/03/2021 2:23 AM] hedgehog#6420
right i've been switching networks


[08/03/2021 2:23 AM] ONI#6888
wait why?


[08/03/2021 2:23 AM] hedgehog#6420
what u haven't tried matic??


[08/03/2021 2:24 AM] ONI#6888
I mean what does that have to do with yearn


[08/03/2021 2:24 AM] hedgehog#6420
idk cookies?


[08/03/2021 2:24 AM] ONI#6888
switching networks doesnt matter, so long as you on eth


[08/03/2021 2:24 AM] ONI#6888
when your connect to yearn.finance


[08/03/2021 2:24 AM] ONI#6888
so I would do what I suggested above and retry


[08/03/2021 2:25 AM] ONI#6888
again you need enough eth in your wallet to be able to send the trx or it will give you an error


[08/03/2021 2:25 AM] ONI#6888
so if you have 20$ eth and you try to withdrawal it wont let you


[08/03/2021 2:25 AM] hedgehog#6420
ill try that thanks


[08/03/2021 2:25 AM] ONI#6888
if you do that on yearn.finance and it doesnt work then try yearn.fi


[08/03/2021 2:26 AM] ONI#6888
if it still doesnt work it could be an authorization error, ie you said this yearn vault can spend (deposit) 500$, and you're trying to deposit 1000$. After doing everything I said above if it still doesnt work it could be this.


[08/03/2021 7:38 PM] inthetrees#9226
Hi all. i am trying to zap on yearn for the Boost pool with USDC. It says either zap is down or not enough liquidity?  Trying to figure out which it is

Hi, I want to mint the NFTs but waiting for cheaper gas. Is there a deadline to redeem them?


[08/03/2021 11:11 PM] ONI#6888
you can try on zapper.fi


[08/03/2021 11:11 PM] ONI#6888
on yearn we limit all zaps to 1% slippage so that could be the problem

@MOGEE can you refresh the page with cntl+shift+r, reconnect your wallet and try again

I successfully extracted thank you


[08/04/2021 12:25 PM] Merkletree#7275
I was wondering the same thing and found this from official Synthetix blog "SNX Staking Rewards cannot be transferred for one year

SNX staking rewards (not sUSD fees) have an escrow period of one year before they can be vested. This just means that they are locked and can’t be transferred during that time.
However, you can stake your escrowed SNX staking rewards, allowing you to mint more sUSD and increase your yield."  So indeed it does look like there's "zero" yield, then allofasudden on month 12 they unlock and are recognized in the pool. Seems the Yearn vault should have 1) a warning that yield is delayed/lockedup, and 2) some kind of vesting gauge or unlock meter to show how long before next rewards


[08/05/2021 3:33 AM] jblzs#8270
On yearn.fi for my vaults I'm in I see one green number and one white number. When I go to withdraw I can only withdraw the white number, which is the lower of the two. Can someone explain this to me? I'm still having trouble understanding how the rewards are distributed

[08/05/2021 1:27 PM] Akai Sedo#0339

[08/05/2021 10:37 PM] ONI#6888
it might be showing vault shares and amount of deposit token. Just withdrawal like normal its working correctly

So, i deposited 8 snx to yearn some time ago through the browser extension in trust wallet. Now i want to pull it out but the internal browser was removed and when i try to remove it through chrome i only get a pop up saying my 'wallet is connecting' it goes away and i get an 'unknown error has occurred' minutes later. has anyone found a way to fix this?

Hi. After depositing USDT on vault, I can only see my money in the dashboard section. Impossible to withdraw. Any suggestions?  Thanks


[08/08/2021 7:01 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
They might be displaying wrong data, check yearn.finance/vaults for accurate info


[08/08/2021 7:02 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Because you’re trying to deposit eth in another vault is not the eth vault. Try to do it directly with zapper.fi


[08/08/2021 7:03 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Go to yearn.finance/vaults, connect the vault and It should detect your deposit. You can withdraw there if you want


[08/08/2021 9:51 AM] Jocelyn#3025
hi, I can't seem to connect my dapper wallet to yearn. I'm trying to remove my ETH from the vault

may i know what are the step that would allow me to connect and perform the removal?


[08/08/2021 11:30 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
How did you connected the wallet to deposit? If dapper is not an option, you’ll have to use one that is an option

@ here , looking to deposit into the SNX vault v2 but it charge me 2k+ fees in gas, is it right or why is the estimate (meta mask) so off?% Everything seem to go into gas when using metamask so it throws insuficient fund cause it think it doesn'T have SNX


[08/09/2021 1:13 AM] Snipeforce#3086

Hi.  I tried to withdraw from ETH2 rather than migrate.  I used the fast gas option 4x and it failed every time.  Can someone let me know what is going on?  I've got plenty of gas.  I do the transaction for the appropriate gwei, but they keep failing "out of gas"


[08/09/2021 1:50 AM] ONI#6888
is this on yearn.finance?


[08/09/2021 1:50 AM] ONI#6888
What wallet are you using? Are you on mobile or desktop?


[08/09/2021 1:51 AM] Danny C | Ready Player#6777
i've tried yearn.finance and yearn.fi


[08/09/2021 1:51 AM] ONI#6888
did it give a red error on metamask when drafting the transaction?


[08/09/2021 1:52 AM] ONI#6888
you mean connect directly to ledger?


[08/09/2021 1:52 AM] ONI#6888
Its best to use ledger with metamask, I would try that as it generally works better.


[08/09/2021 1:52 AM] ONI#6888
I see


[08/09/2021 1:53 AM] Danny C | Ready Player#6777
sounds good.  I'll try that now. Just making sure there's not something wrong over there


[08/09/2021 1:53 AM] ONI#6888
I havent heard anything it could be wallet connect is outputing the right gas limit since the eth update or something


[08/09/2021 1:53 AM] ONI#6888
havent heard anyone else say they could withdrawal from the eth vault


[08/09/2021 1:53 AM] ONI#6888
but I will check on it


[08/09/2021 1:53 AM] Danny C | Ready Player#6777
ok cool.  Thanks.  Appreciate that.


[08/09/2021 3:45 AM] Jocelyn#3025
it was an option when i deposited my coins last year. But now that option has disappeared

Hi. how long does it take for the SNX deposit to become visible?


[08/09/2021 5:34 AM] ONI#6888
Is should be instant after your deposit trx goes through


[08/09/2021 5:34 AM] ONI#6888
try to refresh with cntl+shift+r


[08/09/2021 5:35 AM] txrx0101#3497
nope


[08/09/2021 5:35 AM] txrx0101#3497
I see transaction is approved, fees have been paid too but I dont see balance


[08/09/2021 5:36 AM] txrx0101#3497
and strange enough it still shows me balance available for staking allthough that is already approved to be staked


[08/09/2021 5:46 AM] txrx0101#3497
can someone from yearn team please look into this?


[08/09/2021 5:46 AM] ONI#6888
Hey so to deposit into a yVault it takes two trxs


[08/09/2021 5:46 AM] ONI#6888
one to approve the vault to spend the deposit token, and one to actually deposit


[08/09/2021 5:46 AM] ONI#6888
likely you only did the first transaction and have yet to deposit


[08/09/2021 5:47 AM] txrx0101#3497
I see approvals for spend limit


[08/09/2021 5:47 AM] ONI#6888
if the trx on etherscan says approval or something similar you didn't deposit


[08/09/2021 5:47 AM] ONI#6888
you can dm me the trx and I can tell you for sure. Also I, nor any of the admins, will dm you first


[08/09/2021 5:48 AM] txrx0101#3497
so currently it shows me that I still have balance to stake so you mean I should stake again?


[08/09/2021 5:48 AM] ONI#6888
yes just try again

Yes @vany , they were Woofi'ed then I transfered them back to YFI.

I have some questions about SNX vault.
1. What are the rewards? Is it compounded with SNX?
2. SNX staking rewards are locked for 1 year. So, does 50% APY not include staking rewards? If included, is the SNX we withdraw from SNX that others have deposited and received after the lock period?
3. Can't withdraw SNX for 1 year? (due to staking rewards)


[08/10/2021 10:33 AM] ONI#6888
1. The rewards are from staked snx and are vested snx for a year.
2. no the 50% apy does not include the staking rewards, its just due to a curve pool imbalance we were able to capitalize on. 
3. Yes if you want the staked rewards you need to wait a year.
All current rewards are from the SNX debt that is deposited into our yvSUSD vault

So hacker setup a scam contract?


[08/10/2021 11:35 AM] j.#6352

We are trying to see if it was site related with yearn, which websites did you visit when you did the approval?


[08/10/2021 11:39 AM] j.#6352
and this is not a seed phrase phishing thing right?

[08/10/2021 11:39 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
I doubt it, he would have drained the whole wallet

[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] Hyru#2473
Im pretty sure I have no malware


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] Rеmy#8909
its like when they used to inject a different address in receiver


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] j.#6352
yea check your wallet history


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] Rеmy#8909
similar stuff


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] Hyru#2473
this imac is brand new. and did nothing special.


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] Jihoon#3260
3. Then, Does this mean that if I withdraw before the end of the year, I don't get any staking rewards and only yvsUSD rewards? Or is it impossible to withdraw for 1 year at all?


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] Rеmy#8909
they inject different approval address


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes, check your Internet explorer for what website you visited when you did the approval


[08/10/2021 11:40 AM] 0xB00B5#2575
check your browser history for t his date Aug-06-2021 02:48:53 PM +UTC)

[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Rеmy#8909
maybe a malicious website injects wrong approvals


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Hyru#2473
yes metamask


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Rеmy#8909

[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Rеmy#8909
we have seen this before no ?


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Rеmy#8909
a phishing yearn website


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Probably, we want to know which website to warn people


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] j.#6352
there was a guy who lost money through a javascript exploit on metamask


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Rеmy#8909
it was posted here


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Rеmy#8909
last week


[08/10/2021 11:41 AM] Rеmy#8909

[08/10/2021 11:42 AM] Rеmy#8909
it has all the same things but fake approvals


[08/10/2021 11:42 AM] j.#6352
im also gonna guess you did this on yearn.finance?


[08/10/2021 11:42 AM] j.#6352
if not, then that should be your lead


[08/10/2021 11:43 AM] Hyru#2473
ofc on yearn.finance


[08/10/2021 11:43 AM] Rеmy#8909
yea well i saw a yearn.finAnce with the a being weird


[08/10/2021 11:43 AM] Rеmy#8909
its pretty hard to notice if you dont check twice


[08/10/2021 11:43 AM] Rеmy#8909
idk


[08/10/2021 11:43 AM] j.#6352
then i have no other guesses

[08/10/2021 12:35 PM] Jihoon#3260
You mean 1 Year staking = 50% apy from sUSD vault + SNX staking reward. Right?


[08/10/2021 12:35 PM] ONI#6888
the yearly staking isnt count in apy till a year from now because it hasnt been realized


[08/10/2021 12:35 PM] dudesahn#2338
this is when it happened


[08/10/2021 12:36 PM] ONI#6888
we only count realized historical yield from the past week, compounded weekly annualized


[08/10/2021 12:36 PM] Hyru#2473
well clearly the aave website is not it


[08/10/2021 12:36 PM] Hyru#2473

how do you know?


[08/10/2021 12:38 PM] Hyru#2473
transferred my funds from matic to eth


[08/10/2021 12:38 PM] ONI#6888
because you transfered your funds out of your wallet later?


[08/10/2021 12:39 PM] Hyru#2473
if my private key was compromised my wallet would be wiped cleaner.


[08/10/2021 12:39 PM] Hyru#2473
it was just the approval for this token


[08/10/2021 12:39 PM] arberx#3367
Yeah why would the attacker use only the approved funds

When staking in SNX vault, can I receive the airdrop given to SNX stakers?


[08/11/2021 2:51 AM] ONI#6888
Yes it is usually sold for more snx, instead of given to your account but we do handle them on a case by case basis


[08/11/2021 2:54 AM] Jihoon#3260
That is good.


[08/11/2021 6:30 AM] yakun#0023
When I tried to withdraw my crvDUSD deposit to USDT, the withdrawal failed and I received the following message: “Zap Failed. This means there is not enough liquidity for this token or Zapper may be down.” What shall I do?


[08/11/2021 6:32 AM] ONI#6888
It probably means that slippage on that zap was more than 1%, I would try again on zapper.fi and increase slippage if you are ok with higher slippage


[08/11/2021 7:56 AM] martec#3803
Hi, I can't withdraw from the crvLink vault. UI doesn't seem to work. Both Zaps and normal withdrawals don't react to klick. Using Brave Browser with Metamask on Desktop.


[08/11/2021 7:57 AM] martec#3803
Not feeling confident enough to directly interact with the Contract since there is multiple withdrawal options there.

Hello, I would like to make a deposit on https://yearn.finance/vaults/0xdCD90C7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770B4325 (crvSTETH) but I currently have steth. Has the "zap" thing been removed ?
Also tried https://yearn.fi/invest/0xdCD90C7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770B4325 where I can choose to deposit steth (zap enabled?) but it fails with the following error : "Returned error: execution reverted: Error Swapping Tokens 1"


[08/12/2021 6:29 AM] j.#6352
This could be due to slippage. Yearn's Zapper.fi integration has 1% slippage by default. to get past this, you can try it directly on Zapper.fi or manually by depositing in Curve first then in Yearn


[08/12/2021 6:32 AM] DavBE#5681
Thanks. What token do I need ? curSTETH ? Can't find it on Zapper.fi


[08/12/2021 6:34 AM] j.#6352
Click the *Pool* tab on the left menu. Type "yearn" in the search box under *Explore Opportunities*. Click the one and only result. You should see crvSTETH (v2) fourth on the list


[08/12/2021 6:35 AM] DavBE#5681
Got "Error swapping tokens."


[08/12/2021 6:35 AM] DavBE#5681
Slippage tolerance is 3%


[08/12/2021 6:35 AM] j.#6352
go with Curve first then

i'm trying to stake USDC in yvBOOST-ETH v2. i've already approved the USDC spend and the pSLP spend. however, im now running into this when i try to deposit the USDC into the vault. 

what's going on here? the gas seems exceptionally high, but there's also that large ALERT transaction error exception.

[08/12/2021 10:48 AM] DavBE#5681
Do I have to "approve" every time I want to deposit ?


[08/12/2021 10:49 AM] ONI#6888
I think on yearn it approves for the amount your sending, zapper might let you infinite approve that coin


[08/12/2021 10:50 AM] DavBE#5681
oh i see, it's the "Infinite allowance" in the options

Hi there, I'm currently trying to stake crvSTETH into the yearn pool from my argent wallet and am having troubles. It seems the wallet connect bridge between yearn and argent keep failing so I cannot successfully confirm the transaction in my argent app. Is there anything I can do on my end to make the wallet connect bridge more stable or do I just have to wait for updates from yearn/argent on this?


[08/12/2021 1:39 PM] bumblehuzz#1024
Hello, I attempted to deposit stETH into the Yearn crvSTETH vault via WalletConnect/Argent yesterday. The pre-authorization transaction on Argent was completed, but I didn't see anything about the actual transaction on Yearn.

When I try to deposit again, a new pre-authorization transaction is initialized on Argent which would require me to pay duplicate gas costs.

Any idea what happened with my initial transaction and how/whether I can move forward with it? Thank you for any help you can offer!

What does the approval transaction mean?


[08/15/2021 9:34 AM] j.#6352
it's probably just the approval transaction. you'll have to do the actual deposit after that


[08/15/2021 9:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
When I deposit nothing happens


[08/15/2021 9:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like when i click it nothing happens 😦


[08/15/2021 9:35 AM] j.#6352
When you interact with contracts that involve transfer of tokens, you need to send an approval transaction to allow that to happen, and only after that can you deposit


[08/15/2021 9:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
There are two deposit buttons, the first one to make avaliable Eth  deposit


[08/15/2021 9:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
And the second to deposit from vault

@Unknown i had a similar problem with the UI just not responding to the _actual_ deposit (already well past the approval process). the yearn website w the yvboost trade is very fickle. consistent advice here is to just use sushiswap and then do everything manually.

Pickle Farm. using the zap on the Yearn website will get bring your deposit into the Pickle Jar. The Pickle Farm is the last step, if you want PICKLE yield

Yes trackavault in #🔗links is accurate and uses our APIs. I think you are looking at yvToken balance vs USD balance which is different amounts. Trackavault is built to show the data in an easily viewable form, so that is the best place to view yield gained on our vaults.

{Reactions}
yea 

[08/20/2021 12:47 PM] DrEvil#0372
Newbie to Yearn here, so apologies in advance.

for a typical stablecoin strategy I would do something like the following:

1.  Deposit on the Curve website into one of the usd pools e.g. gUSD

2.  I will receive the crvGUSD token in my metamask, which allows me to collect rewards from the curve website.

3.  Deposit the crvGUSD from metamask to the yearn crvGUSD vault, which means I will no longer receive rewards from the Curve website, as I have passed earning rights along to the yearn crvGUSD vault, so I will receive the compounding apy from the yearn crvGUSD vault only at this point.

Is that about it or is it possible to layer more rewards into this?

I know if I just did everything on the Curve website I would get the crvGUSD rewards and would stake any crv earned in the gauge.

Looking for the best returns on stablecoins ideally.

Thanks and sorry if this is not posted in the right channel :-]


[08/20/2021 12:56 PM] j.#6352
This looks correct


[08/20/2021 12:58 PM] DrEvil#0372
Thanks!

So is it maybe better (using the gUSD example) to zap USDT into the yearn crvGUSD vault and not bother with the Curve.finance website at all?


[08/20/2021 1:00 PM] j.#6352
Yes. This would reduce your transaction count from a maximum of four to a maximum of two. Gas spent might be similar


[08/20/2021 1:02 PM] DrEvil#0372
So I would then just have the yearn gUSD balance compounding up to increase by crvGUSD token holdings over time.  There is nothing else that comes out of the yearn pool that I can layer up into a boost pool or something?

Sorry for the noob questions


[08/20/2021 1:09 PM] j.#6352
Nope. No need to do anything else. You may find other platforms that allow you to deposit your Yearn vault tokens to farm or borrow against but i dont know much about that. There's abracadabra and unit, if you want to check out some

Trying to withdrawal from SNX vault and getting "Transaction Error. Exception thrown in contract code." with a high suggested gas fee. I've seen several people post this issue over the past month or two, but I don't see any solution. I can withdrawal 100 SNX, but anything over that amount and I get the error, despite having more in the vault. What should I do? Thanks @Yearn Admin

Have similar issue on borrowing against Sushi collateral: Yean.fi/lend not increasing the borrow limit after depositing Sushi (collateral on).


[08/22/2021 8:54 AM] g2b3#7961
Total Supply at top of page recognizes the Sushi, and the Borrow Limit Used reflects for 70% LTV.  However when attempting to select an asset to borrow, the blue Borrow Limit Used dropdown shows a significantly different value than that at top of portfolio,  which indicates it's not including Sushi as collateral.


[08/22/2021 8:57 AM] g2b3#7961
Is this a known issue for Sushi collateral not being supported?


[08/22/2021 9:57 AM] bayls#2580

[08/22/2021 9:58 AM] bayls#2580
Should I not put staked eth into that vault? can I put eth directly? Strange that 1 staked eth didnt work


[08/22/2021 10:05 AM] j.#6352
This is only an approval transaction. You'll have to do another one to do the actual deposit


[08/22/2021 10:05 AM] j.#6352
like giving permission to the contract to take your tokens


[08/22/2021 10:47 AM] bayls#2580
thx you for your response. Do I need to pay gas twice everytime or only this time as its first time deposting steth into yearn vault


[08/22/2021 10:49 AM] j.#6352
Approvals are for the first time only. you can then deposit as many times as you want


[08/22/2021 10:50 AM] j.#6352
note that this is commonly by default and that you can set your own approval limit/amount if you want


[08/22/2021 11:18 AM] bayls#2580

[08/22/2021 11:21 AM] j.#6352
Could be a slippage or Zapper.fi-specific issue. Two things to try: 1. Do your deposit on Zapper.fi. Click the *Pool* tab, type *yearn* in the search box under *Explore Opportunities*, then look for crvstETH. If that still doesnt work, you'll have to deposit in the Curve pool first, then deposit the Curve LP tokens in Yearn


[08/22/2021 5:53 PM] bayls#2580
Hi yHelper would when I go to the pool on curve to I look for Steth-eth and do I sell my staked eth my regular eth not sure what to do.


[08/22/2021 5:53 PM] bayls#2580
just want to keep it simple reason I chose yearn is because its simple


[08/22/2021 7:28 PM] vany#0365
https://curve.fi/steth/deposit you can deposit here and then come back to yearn and deposit the pool token, if the zap is not working


[08/23/2021 2:57 AM] Gutle#5796
Hi, I have the same issue but I'm trying to deposit some ETH


[08/23/2021 2:58 AM] Gutle#5796
to get yvWETH v2, not sure where I can do this on zapper.fi


[08/23/2021 3:27 AM] vany#0365
You are trying to deposit eth into the eth vault? That should not cause a slippage issue. Maybe try from yearn.fi if it’s not working on yearn.finance


[08/23/2021 4:04 AM] Gutle#5796
Yep into ETH vault. I tried it on yearn.fi now and got this error "Returned error: execution reverted: Err: High Slippage"


[08/23/2021 4:05 AM] Gutle#5796
I set slippage 3% too


[08/23/2021 4:21 AM] vany#0365
Will pass along to the team that should not happen


[08/23/2021 4:23 AM] Gutle#5796
Thanks vany


[08/23/2021 7:07 AM] g2b3#7961
Is Sushi supported as collateral for borrowing on Yearn.fi/lend?


[08/23/2021 9:06 AM] bayls#2580
Vany if I just want to deposit 1 staked eth on curve and then deposit that curvesteth on yearn what do I click. the UI is not clear at all. Do I need to do half eth half of 1 staked eth? do I just click deposit and stake or just deposit?


[08/23/2021 9:11 AM] j.#6352
You can deposit either. if you have stETH, you can deposit just that. You want to *Deposit*, **not** *Deposit and Stake*


[08/23/2021 9:12 AM] j.#6352
after that, you can deposit your Curve LP (crvstETH) in Yearn


[08/23/2021 9:48 AM] Gutle#5796
HI, ETH vault still has error. I just tried also on zapper.fi ETH for WETH (V2) and still error there too.


[08/23/2021 10:02 AM] j.#6352

Hi guys. I while ago I deposited a bunch of eth into the yCRV/WETH vault.  i recently did a withdraw but received like a 10th of the ETH i deposited. wondering if i messed something up, or forgot something.

im sitting with a bunch of yvBOOST which may be related?

seems like i lost alot. like 100eth


[08/23/2021 4:33 PM] arberx#3367
Yes you lost a bunch. Look at the price of yvecrv compared to curve


[08/23/2021 4:34 PM] arberx#3367
We don’t recommend that vault unless you know what you’re doing


[08/23/2021 4:34 PM] arberx#3367
You basically converted your crv to yvcrv, which accrues fees and locks your crv


[08/23/2021 4:35 PM] arberx#3367
However market discounts the price given the process is irreversible

[08/26/2021 12:19 PM] j.#6352
On the website, you can only see up to the second decimal (x.xx) so if your deposit is less than those digits, you may not see it correctly. Also yield has been low, even 0% for a while. Check your deposit's performance on other platforms like Zapper.fi, Zerion.io, and others in #🔗links

Migrate or Die

Yearn v1 vaults have served everyone as a reliable source of yield for almost a year, but now the time has come to say goodbye.

All old vaults have been harvested one last time and divested from the strategies. 

You can migrate to v2 at any time without fees.

Is the Yearn Net apy  also displaying the original lido apr? or you should add 50% of your stETH /ETH position on the curve pool to the yearn net APY?


[08/27/2021 5:25 PM] vany#0365
should be calculated in the POOL APY

You need ETH to do any and all transactions on Ethereum. WETH is tokenized ETH. Check that you have enough ETH to pay for the transaction fee

[08/28/2021 12:28 PM] j.#6352
Hmm then you should be able to confirm the transaction anyway. You don't need WETH to migrate. You'll only be paying for gas


[08/28/2021 12:33 PM] blue26#3685
This says I need to move 0.09 ETH, yes?  I need to know how to do that.  When I press the buttons given to me "confirm" stays gray

When you click *Migrate*, nothing happens?

I don't understand how performance fees work


[08/28/2021 8:43 PM] vany#0365
lets say the gross apy is 10%. yearn gets 20% of that. so yearn gets 2% of earnings and you get 8%


[08/28/2021 8:54 PM] FluffCorgi#8111

Why is the yaLink vault dead?


[08/28/2021 9:53 PM] arberx#3367
It’s not


[08/28/2021 9:53 PM] arberx#3367
Just not yielding much


[08/28/2021 10:22 PM] vany#0365
there is a new LINK vault in our v2 vaults thats earning 9.5%

HI. Is there a way to check and see what I have staked right now on yearn by checking my wallet address? i am having troubling finding it on the website


[08/29/2021 3:11 AM] j.#6352
Check your wallet address on Etherscan for tokens with a *yv-*or *y-* prefix. You can also connect your wallet to Zapper.fi or Zerion.io


[08/29/2021 3:11 AM] Stefan_flight#3901
thanks!

[08/29/2021 12:00 PM] Stefan_flight#3901
does staking at yearn utilize BPT tokens? I am trying to see if the ones i have are issued for the staked coin I have at yearn or another platform. thanks!


[08/29/2021 12:01 PM] arberx#3367
Blackpool token?


[08/29/2021 12:02 PM] arberx#3367
No I don’t think any strat farms that


[08/29/2021 12:02 PM] Stefan_flight#3901
Balancer Pool Token I believe


[08/29/2021 12:02 PM] Stefan_flight#3901
BPT 3 is what i have


[08/29/2021 12:02 PM] arberx#3367
Oh


[08/29/2021 12:02 PM] arberx#3367
I don’t think so


[08/29/2021 12:02 PM] arberx#3367
But maybe


[08/29/2021 12:02 PM] arberx#3367
One strat might.

Strategy


[08/30/2021 1:34 AM] ONI#6888
no our old staking pools for farming YFI used them for like 2 weeks, we dont use it anymore


[08/30/2021 1:35 AM] ONI#6888
Even if strategies use Balancer you wont see it as a token, you would only be holding yvTokens ie vault tokens. Everything else is abstracted away.


[08/30/2021 1:55 PM] ayybee#0185
are the LNIK and SUSHI v2 vaults new? or just temp earning more than normal? whats happening there?


[08/30/2021 1:56 PM] ONI#6888

Can I ask if yearn.vision is working correctly? The data in the price charts seems to have stopped at 24 Aug 15:30 (i assume my timezone). The price charts dont seem to go past that date


[08/30/2021 11:01 PM] arberx#3367

[08/30/2021 11:01 PM] arberx#3367
We’re looking into it


[08/30/2021 11:45 PM] gulatinavneet#7335
Hey team,
I have a question regarding the performance fee. If I were to withdraw 100 USDC of the 1000 USDC deposited in the yearn vault, when will the performance fee be deducted? Will it be deducted proportionally from the 100 USDC I am withdrawing or is it deducted proportionally from the remaining amount in the vault?


[08/30/2021 11:54 PM] arberx#3367
The fees are deducted every harvest, amortized over the year (not all at once). So it’s already deducted, proportionately to your deposit, not when you withdraw.


[08/30/2021 11:55 PM] gulatinavneet#7335
Sure thanks @arberx


[08/31/2021 7:24 AM] twosevenkid#8806
Aave vault not detecting aave balance in wallet? Clicked Max, coming back as NaN

[09/01/2021 7:26 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Are you sure you have connected the wallet with aave tokens ( native aave, not staked aave)


[09/01/2021 8:42 AM] Acktarius#8882
Hi, I deposit on crvSTETH, transaction went through  using Metamask but nothing appears on the vault on yearn website ?? #?


[09/01/2021 8:50 AM] j.#6352
You probably have only done the approval transaction. You'll have to do another one for the actual deposit


[09/01/2021 8:51 AM] Acktarius#8882
I had two transactions done in the end on my metamask (and on etherscan) so I would guess for one is the deposit and second one the approval ?


[09/01/2021 8:53 AM] j.#6352
Hmm. Can you check your address on Zapper.fi or Zerion.io or Trackavault.com if your deposit is visible there?


[09/01/2021 8:57 AM] Acktarius#8882
No, it’s not showing on those


[09/01/2021 8:57 AM] j.#6352
Ok can you send me an Etherscan link to one of the two txs you did?


[09/01/2021 8:58 AM] j.#6352

Hi yAll! 😉


[09/03/2021 7:23 AM] hodlbrodl_UST#1870
I have one question: i zapped in with eth to crv3crypto vault some days ago. I tried to refund (directly and per eth) just for testing, but when i click the refund button it does not work. Is there a lock period or something like this?


[09/03/2021 7:24 AM] j.#6352
No lock period. When you say "it does not work", does that mean nothing happens at all? Metamask doesnt pop up?


[09/03/2021 7:28 AM] hodlbrodl_UST#1870
i used my ledger. nothing popped up. the withdray button is black with blue edge, it has click feedback but nothing happens


[09/03/2021 7:28 AM] j.#6352
Try to use your Ledger through Metamask


[09/03/2021 7:29 AM] j.#6352
Using Ledger directly hasnt worked 100% from reports by other users


[09/03/2021 7:30 AM] j.#6352
An alternative: you can do this on zapper.fi too. you can try that to see if it works better


[09/03/2021 7:30 AM] hodlbrodl_UST#1870
ah ok, i will try. I dont want to withdraw yet, i would not sign the transaction. but i want to know it is working. 😉


[09/03/2021 7:30 AM] j.#6352
yea i wouldnt recommend it right now either with gas at 200 gwei

excuse my language


[09/03/2021 3:17 PM] j.#6352
whats the apy now?


[09/03/2021 3:17 PM] Sith#8091
but I can take this yvSNX token to another vault say a curve-yvSNX or I have to withdraw my SNX first to get it


[09/03/2021 3:17 PM] Sith#8091
30%


[09/03/2021 3:17 PM] j.#6352
not bad


[09/03/2021 3:18 PM] Sith#8091
its actually rlly good for just the SNX vault


[09/03/2021 3:18 PM] Sith#8091
its been like 2% tho


[09/03/2021 3:18 PM] Sith#8091
forever it opened at 80%.  ive been in since the SNX vault dropped


[09/03/2021 3:18 PM] j.#6352
maybe because of the one year lock thing?


[09/03/2021 3:18 PM] j.#6352
i didnt look into that too much about how it works


[09/03/2021 3:19 PM] Sith#8091
so I asked a mod about this a month or two ago lol


[09/03/2021 3:19 PM] Sith#8091
literally told me there wasnt a lock


[09/03/2021 3:19 PM] Sith#8091
think there is


[09/03/2021 3:19 PM] j.#6352
not in the vault


[09/03/2021 3:19 PM] Sith#8091
so whats the one year lock thing to your understanding


[09/03/2021 3:19 PM] j.#6352
but on Synthetix itself yea


[09/03/2021 3:19 PM] Sith#8091
oh its a mechanics of SNX staking itself


[09/03/2021 3:20 PM] j.#6352
From what i remember you wont get the one year lock rewards if you withdraw before that one year


[09/03/2021 3:20 PM] j.#6352
yup


[09/03/2021 3:20 PM] j.#6352
so it's not about the vault


[09/03/2021 3:20 PM] Sith#8091
so in reality I probably dont see rewards until after 1 year


[09/03/2021 3:20 PM] Sith#8091
good convo


[09/03/2021 3:20 PM] Sith#8091
not doing it

[09/03/2021 5:33 PM] Sith#8091
@j. hey man hate to bother you again but Im still a little uncertain what the reward would be at the end of the year for the vault I guess what the staking APY is?. What different strategies there are that you listed above ^ and if the SNX rewards are only received at the end of the year. Also, lastly does the reward get distributed based on percentage of share based on the ppl still in the vault from the whole year. I would imagine it goes like this.  1000 ppl are in the vault


[09/03/2021 5:36 PM] Sith#8091
half leave before the rewards are released leaving 500. between the 500 % of vault  have in you are of say the staked supply at the 1 year mark will be distributed evenly.  If I was 5% of the supply to start and 10% of the supply when rewards are released theoritically I would receive 10% bc the half that left rewards are distributed to those that stayed in its entirety


[09/03/2021 5:39 PM] j.#6352
If you leave before the one year is up, you do not get rewards


[09/03/2021 5:39 PM] j.#6352
But im not sure how to visualize what you're describing specifically


[09/03/2021 5:40 PM] Sith#8091
you answered an important question that I think I realized anyways


[09/03/2021 5:40 PM] j.#6352
since i dont know how the SNX weekly rewards work


[09/03/2021 5:40 PM] Sith#8091
well i have been recieving weekly awards


[09/03/2021 5:40 PM] Sith#8091
but what is the yearly reward. Id like to know what amount of money id be missing out on


[09/03/2021 5:41 PM] Sith#8091
opportunity cost


[09/03/2021 5:41 PM] j.#6352
hmm


[09/03/2021 5:41 PM] Sith#8091
if its based on SNX I would assume its staking


[09/03/2021 5:41 PM] Sith#8091
geniunely think its not worth me leaving it in there


[09/03/2021 5:41 PM] j.#6352
you'll have to compare doing the SNX strategy yourself against the 65% split of the vault strategy - fees


[09/03/2021 5:42 PM] Sith#8091
we split fees 65% with yearn?


[09/03/2021 5:42 PM] Sith#8091
for managing>


[09/03/2021 5:42 PM] j.#6352
no. 65% of the SNX vault deposits are allocated for SNX staking and the rest in Universe


[09/03/2021 5:43 PM] j.#6352
you can see this in the yearn.watch link i sent earlier


[09/03/2021 5:43 PM] Sith#8091
I looked at it just didnt really understand it


[09/03/2021 5:44 PM] j.#6352
You can click the 'allocation' tab to see the distribution of vault funds into strategies and you can click on the 'strategies' tab to see the strategies used by the vault


[09/03/2021 5:45 PM] j.#6352
the strategy names describe what a given strategy does

Without owning any ib3CRV LP, is there any way to see how what the exchange rate to yvCRV-IB is? (for depositing them into the crvIB v2 Yearn vault: https://yearn.fi/invest/0x27b7b1ad7288079A66d12350c828D3C00A6F07d7 ?)


[09/04/2021 6:27 AM] elk#0645

Hi, what can be the issue while I am trying to withdraw all the ETH from ETH vault, but yearn creating the transaction in Metamask with 0 eth to transfer.  I still see a proper balance of yvWETH in my account. Anyone have that problem before?


[09/04/2021 9:52 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
In the contract of the vault you can see the variable pricePerShare that is ib3crv LP/yvCRV-IB. Right now it’s 1.0654125 https://etherscan.io/address/0x27b7b1ad7288079A66d12350c828D3C00A6F07d7#readContract

💯 🙏 

[09/04/2021 9:54 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
It’s not a problem. When you want to withdraw the transaction you send is a call to the function withdraw of the vault contract, you don’t send any ETH. Once mined you burn the yvWETH shares and the contract gives you the equivalent amount in ETH


[09/04/2021 10:30 AM] yaroslav.nosa#8376
Thanks, now its clear, anyway frightening for newbies without tips in ui


[09/04/2021 11:29 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
It’s a general behavior when you interact with basically any dapp, you almost never send/receive ETH and it’s shown in MetaMask window but interact via calls to public functions of the contract


[09/04/2021 11:32 AM] yaroslav.nosa#8376
Ok, lets leave out amount in transaction, isn't contract execution synchronous? So if transaction is mined, there should be account balance change? How it could be executed later?


[09/04/2021 11:40 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes, there is a change in the database. ETH left the contract and goes to your address, what I mean is that the ETH amount that appears in the MetaMask window is only ETH sent to the address you’re interacting with. To call withdraw you don’t need to send any eth to the contract hence it shows as 0 ETH in MetaMask

Hello! I have a little issue. Im trying to deposit DAI for yvBOOST, I already approved the DAI spend for it, but I didn't had enough ETH to pay for the contract interaction so I rejected it to add extra funds. After the extra ETH funds arrived, I tried to complete the transaction and pay for the contract interaction, but I´m asked again for the DAI spend approval. Why is this happening? what I did wrong?


[09/06/2021 2:38 PM] j.#6352
was the approval transaction confirmed?

[09/08/2021 12:30 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
the deposit limit was hit, unless someone withdraw or it's increased you can't ape


[09/08/2021 5:12 PM] akshaynexus#3840
will look into upping the deposit limit once i can alloc it better for more yield.


[09/08/2021 5:13 PM] akshaynexus#3840
atm utilization is low cause of the subgraph issues tarot has from what i see so currently testing different allocation amounts until its optimized for good yield


[09/08/2021 5:39 PM] Gravis#1242
alrite, Ill keep my eye on it.  Thank you


[09/08/2021 11:32 PM] Gravis#1242
thank you!   new vault, in.  Very bullish on tarot.   Was the best lending rates i could find on ftm, although variable.   This is great.  We are wafting for yearn over here btw, welcome anytime


[09/09/2021 1:30 AM] contempt(sam)#1069
I'm not sure why I can't find an answer for this but, does creating a vault usually take 300-400$ in eth gas?


[09/09/2021 2:01 AM] vany#0365
creating or joining? joining depends on the vault and if you are zapping or not. if you are depositing the vault token (Deposit USDC into USDC vault) it should be under $100


[09/09/2021 2:02 AM] vany#0365
you can always click on the vault name and check recent transactions with the vault to see how much other people paid

hi, I hate to bother you with this, Vault CrvEURS - I have used zapper to send in USDC (3 months ago) and I removed it today and received fewer USDC than I put in, the APY was on average +10% (according to yearn.finance dashboard my stack should have grown by ~4% ), any idea what happened?


[09/12/2021 12:13 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Slippage probably, or eurs <-> usdc exchange rate


[09/12/2021 2:18 PM] vany#0365
The euro is down vs the dollar over that time period


[09/12/2021 2:20 PM] vany#0365
So you basically bough the euro at $1.22 in June and now its only worth $1.18


[09/12/2021 2:21 PM] Armstrong🤖💵💵💰💰.#0469
hey guys, is there any way/tool/simulation to check the slippage when zapping (for example from naked DAI to crvGUSD) in yearn.finance UI before actual depositing/withdrawing?

The only way right now (for me before aping) is to visit Curve.fi, choose the GUSD pool, input all my DAI (only DAI, no other stables) => Curve will display the slippage in advance for me to consider


[09/12/2021 2:23 PM] j.#6352
I usually check both zapper and zerion for those

not sure which of these two youre looking for but i think it's the first one


[09/12/2021 3:07 PM] Armstrong🤖💵💵💰💰.#0469
hmm thx, I tried yesterday but my dollars were not in my wallet so zerion/zapper did not let me choose the currency I'd like to check (butttt I just got a work around by tracking the wallet of a random DAI whale holder, now i can check the slippage using millions of DAI that's not mine 😄 )

However, zerion/zapper does not update new vaults frequently (probably no zap available anyway, as I couldn't find curve-RSV, curve-alUSD or curve-MIM, and there is no zap for curve-FRAX either).
It also does not have a search for yvaults using the contract addresses (i have to go to yearn docs/yearn.watch to get the vault token name, copy paste into zerion to search).

So, let me know if I get this correct with doing manually. Let's say I wanna ape in yVault for Curve USDN using my DAI-only stack:

1. Go to https://curve.fi/usdn/deposit, choose all DAI ("Use maximum amount of coins available"), check if I'm happy with the slippage/bonus
2. Approve, Deposit, get the whateveritstokenname back
3. Go to https://yearn.finance/vaults/0x3B96d491f067912D18563d56858Ba7d6EC67a6fa, and then just Approve/Deposit into Yearn?

(Probably Furucombo can help automate all the 3 steps, but they got a hack before so :peeposhrug: :peeposhrug: :peeposhrug: )

[09/12/2021 3:12 PM] j.#6352
Yes those steps are correct, but why not zap in instead? 
I personally would do those steps manually myself like you listed as some zaps have failed some users recently. I just dont remember which direction and tokens. So the steps you listed are the best and most direct way of doing it


[09/12/2021 3:13 PM] j.#6352
plus approving DAI on the zap contract means you wont have to approve DAI again if you want to deposit in another vault

[09/12/2021 3:43 PM] Armstrong🤖💵💵💰💰.#0469
I hesitate to use yearn-native zap-in because i'd like to compare the specific slippages between vaults, and the UI only says it prevents >1% slippage (which means 0.9% will still go thru buuuutttt 0.9% is a lot if another vault is only 0.4% or smaller)

joinwido.com UI is useful when it calculates the time needed in a vault for breakeven including gas fee but not slippage (which is multiple times bigger than gas fee)


[09/12/2021 3:44 PM] Armstrong🤖💵💵💰💰.#0469

Hello guys! I have been staking some YFI/ETH o Sushiswap for the last few months. On my Metamask address I see some SLP tokens. I wanted to know how I can access or stake these SLPs?


[09/12/2021 4:41 PM] j.#6352
Go to app.sushi.com/farm to farm SUSHI with your YFI/ETH SLP


[09/12/2021 4:42 PM] oeconome#1896
OK thanks for that J! If I understand correctly this farming will convert the SLPs to SUSHI tokens after a little while?


[09/12/2021 4:44 PM] j.#6352
No it doesnt *convert* your SLP. Think of it as parking your SLP somewhere so that you earn SUSHI on top of any trading fees your SLP already earns


[09/12/2021 4:44 PM] oeconome#1896
OK so those SLPs can't be traded, I have them because I provide liquidity between 2 pairs and as long as I stake (farm) them, I get some Sushi tokens as a reward?


[09/12/2021 4:47 PM] oeconome#1896
But the farming pools in Sushi are with wETH, not ETH. I need to wrap my ether to access the farming function?


[09/12/2021 4:48 PM] j.#6352
If you already have the SLP you can just stake it in Sushi Farm


[09/12/2021 4:49 PM] j.#6352
no need to do anything else


[09/12/2021 4:51 PM] oeconome#1896
Ok thank you! How long before I can see some farmed Sushis into my Metamask?


[09/12/2021 4:53 PM] j.#6352
you wont see it in Metamask. You'll see it on Sushiswap or other dashboards that support Sushiswap like Zapper.fi and Zerion.io


[09/12/2021 4:53 PM] j.#6352
i also wouldnt recommend relying on Metamask to track your tokens and balances


[09/12/2021 4:55 PM] oeconome#1896
No I go on etherscan for that. So on Sushiswap I will have to claim my tokens once in a while?


[09/12/2021 4:55 PM] oeconome#1896
claim: stake?


[09/12/2021 4:57 PM] j.#6352
Yup. You'll have to claim/harvest your SUSHI rewards manually

Hi! Now i am writing integration with yearn(throught web3js). I use (yvWETH, yvUSDC, yvUDST) from https://docs.yearn.finance/yearn-finance/yvaults/vault-tokens for getting exchangeRate, but it can be the same almost all day and 1 hour increasing and i dont know when it will be. I calculate profit by diff between two exchangeRate and I dont want to wait increase period, how can I get it? Contracts have locketProfit method, maybe it will usefull fot it(but yvUSDC hasn't)?

P.S. You have a bug on https://docs.yearn.finance/yearn-finance/yvaults/vault-tokens  page -> table V2 yVault Tokens, -> row -> USDT WBTC yvUDST(input token is WBTC! instead USDT)

Hello, I was hoping to get some clarification on a Yearn vault withdrawal I did lastnight. I pulled out of the rETH vault and it looks like it gave me ETH 1:1 for my yvCurve-rETH balance instead of accounting for yield. I was expecting to get ~ 8.1 ETH, but got ~7.92 instead. Here's the Etherscan transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0ef0f0332c6abe90399af705d39346f2bc2300df81c21527ced48a6533783865

[09/14/2021 1:02 PM] j.#6352
It could be from slippage maybe? i just checked on curve.fi/reth. 8 reth = 7.917 eth


[09/14/2021 1:11 PM] ONI#6888
did you zap via our website yearn.finance or at zapper's site?


[09/14/2021 1:18 PM] Brandin138#7754
I withdrew using the Yearn.Fi website, I’ve used that in the past for stETH with no issues.


[09/14/2021 1:19 PM] ONI#6888
Looks like you had slippage on the withdrawal of more than 1% if im not mistaken, our website prevents this, but Yearn.fi is not run by the yearn team, but an independent developer


[09/14/2021 1:19 PM] Brandin138#7754
That was my initial thought, but the # of ETH I received was exactly the amount I received when I deposited 8 ETH to the vault in June, so that didn’t seem correct


[09/14/2021 1:24 PM] Brandin138#7754
Damn, ok thanks for checking.


[09/14/2021 1:25 PM] ONI#6888
I am still looking into it will let you know if I find something


[09/14/2021 1:26 PM] Brandin138#7754
Thanks. Just checked & Yearn.fi defaults to 1% slippage, I wouldn’t have intentionally changed that.

ok thanks


[09/14/2021 1:44 PM] ONI#6888
One thing that is obvious here is that the rETH curve pool is currently imbalanced.

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734811808401063966/887378321321623552/unknown.png


[09/14/2021 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
This is the source of the slippage


[09/14/2021 1:52 PM] ONI#6888
you zapped into the vault 80 days ago when the curve pool was balanced, yearn compounded and earned you yield, but on withdrawal you withdrew when the curve pool was imbalanced and had a 1% slippage on ETH withdrawals so this ate into the yield you gained and then some sadly. Presumably this is because people are moving lots of ETH to Arbitrum for farming, thus the eth pools on curve are imbalanced right now.


[09/14/2021 1:52 PM] kx9x#3778
yep, arbitrum took all the eth from curve


[09/14/2021 1:52 PM] kx9x#3778
so these pools are imbalanced since eth APY is so high they can afford the slippage now


[09/14/2021 1:53 PM] kx9x#3778
this might fix itself when the merge happens and these rETH tokens can finally be exchange for real eth + staking rewards


[09/14/2021 1:53 PM] ONI#6888
well it will probably be fixed after that eth comes back to mainnet (if it does)


[09/14/2021 1:53 PM] Brandin138#7754
Thanks for looking into this. Glad it was something like this & not a contract bug or something malicious.


[09/14/2021 1:54 PM] kx9x#3778
with 7 day withdrawal, gl with that. APY or arb opportunity needs to be very lucrative on mainnet


[09/14/2021 1:54 PM] ONI#6888
Yep sorry about that, also best to check the curve pool slippages before withdrawing both via manually and zap outs


[09/14/2021 1:54 PM] kx9x#3778
once the merge is in sight though, the free 2% people can get by pushing eth into these curve pools will look very, very nice


[09/14/2021 1:55 PM] kx9x#3778
I guess 1% now


[09/14/2021 1:58 PM] ONI#6888
yah makes sense


[09/14/2021 1:59 PM] kx9x#3778
I checked the pool before withdrawing from the same vault, so I ended up withdrawing the curve LP and then withdrawing to rETH


[09/14/2021 2:00 PM] kx9x#3778
got my free like 1-2% reth and now just need to wait it out. It sucks that the slippage can get through via the yearn.finance zap though. Sucks that it was almost exactly 1% too

The total cost of the metamask transaction was like 6.32ETH

check https://curve.fi/steth/withdraw too


[09/14/2021 3:48 PM] dackblake#0001
Like if the peg isn't 1-1 am I able to see how much it would give me?

[09/14/2021 3:49 PM] dackblake#0001
Makes sense why I get way less stETH


[09/14/2021 3:50 PM] dackblake#0001
Reserves are 65% and ETH is 35% so stETH more valuable


[09/14/2021 3:50 PM] j.#6352
yes because of arbitrum


[09/14/2021 3:50 PM] trestian#0001
yeah the crv pool is currently a bit unbalanced due to so much demand for native eth on l2s


[09/14/2021 3:50 PM] j.#6352
id recommend you exit to steth instad if you can and have to


[09/14/2021 3:51 PM] trestian#0001
good time to pick up steth at a discount yeah, unlikely the peg doesn't hold in the longer term


[09/14/2021 3:51 PM] dackblake#0001
I dont plan on exiting now just was curious why I got so much less crvSTETH lol


[09/14/2021 3:51 PM] dackblake#0001
Guess I'll need to leave it in for some time to breakeven


[09/14/2021 3:52 PM] j.#6352
1 yvcrvsteth = (pricepershare of yvcrvsteth) crvstETH


[09/14/2021 3:52 PM] j.#6352
yup


[09/14/2021 3:54 PM] dackblake#0001
Wait


[09/14/2021 3:55 PM] dackblake#0001
Actually shouldnt I be getting more crvSTETH for my ETH? The reserves of ETH are so low relative to stETH so wouldn't that make my ETH deposit more valuable?


[09/14/2021 3:56 PM] j.#6352
depositing ETH = good because the pool needs more of it


[09/14/2021 3:56 PM] dackblake#0001
Yeah so why did I get less crvSTETH


[09/14/2021 3:56 PM] j.#6352
because it's not 1=1

[09/14/2021 4:16 PM] dackblake#0001
So is this the exchange rate between yvcrvsteth and crvsteth?


[09/14/2021 4:16 PM] j.#6352
yes


[09/14/2021 4:16 PM] dackblake#0001
yvcrvsteth 6.2419 = 5.8156 crvsteth


[09/14/2021 4:16 PM] dackblake#0001

[09/14/2021 4:27 PM] dackblake#0001
@j. Here's another question but may not know. If I have ETH (bought it at $200per) and provide liquidity to a pool like crvSTETH, do I have to pay tax gains on the ETH or does my base just transfer over to the crvSTETH. If I transferred crvSTETH back to ETH it would just be more eth and it would be optimal if I didn't have to realize tax gains yet because I didnt sell the ETH for cash or stablcoin.


[09/14/2021 4:28 PM] j.#6352

Same question. My rewards accumulated for 2 weeks then I seemed to have lost the older rewards. Checked the contract directly for claim amount and what's on the UI is the same. Do rewards really expire after some time?

[09/16/2021 6:50 AM] j.#6352
Hi. What's the issue here? It looks ok to me. You just have to send your yvTOKENS to your Ledger address


[09/16/2021 6:50 AM] j.#6352
Is your Ledger address different from your Metamask?


[09/16/2021 6:51 AM] j.#6352
I recommend that you connect your Ledger to Metamask if you havent already. This way, you can interact with DeFi straight from your Ledger with the ease of Metamask


[09/16/2021 6:51 AM] nghia le#7473
Yes Another wallet. Different address


[09/16/2021 6:51 AM] j.#6352
Ok. Just send your yvTOKENS to your Ledger address like you would with any other token

!faq harvest frequency


[09/17/2021 8:10 AM] yfi-faq-bot#6095

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[09/17/2021 8:11 AM] j.#6352
but also, track your deposits on `trackavault.com`, `zapper.fi`, `zerion.io`, or try the new beta site `beta.yearn.finance`

[09/18/2021 1:32 PM] kx9x#3778
other people have less cost for withdrawal


[09/18/2021 1:32 PM] kx9x#3778
one explanation is that the vault has all of its funds deposited into strategies (i.e. nothing idle)


[09/18/2021 1:32 PM] kx9x#3778
so it is more gas intensive to pull from strats


[09/18/2021 1:32 PM] kx9x#3778
also metamask will always quote twice as much as you will actually pay due to EIP-1559 max fee


[09/18/2021 1:33 PM] kx9x#3778
if your max fee is twice as much as the base fee, that is


[09/18/2021 1:33 PM] kx9x#3778
so you can wait until someone deposits and withdraw more cheaply


[09/18/2021 1:34 PM] kx9x#3778
then you will withdraw from idle funds instead of dipping into the strategy


[09/18/2021 1:44 PM] Sooper_#1340

Someone posted this in Convex discord. Are we getting sandwiched on the yvBoost buys?

"every time they harvest rewards from the 3 bil tvl of yearn, they take the crv and convert it to yveboost.. but guess what happens...
a specific wallet frontruns it with a sandwich every single time
every single tx.
+50%
the price is $1.25
it pays $1.75-1.8 each time

hiya, there should be no issue transferring my yVault tokens between wallets (without un-staking first), right? thanks


[09/18/2021 6:45 PM] kx9x#3778
No. That guy is straight up lying


[09/18/2021 6:46 PM] kx9x#3778
he came here and got ass blasted by the team. That is just one sandwich. The idea that it happens each and every time is completely fabricated and he is trying to pump his CVX bags

This one time was a slip up. 99% of harvests these days are done via flashbots and the team is working on fixing the issue where a sandwich can slip through due to uncle blocks

[09/18/2021 6:47 PM] kx9x#3778
if he is still talking about that and lying that it happens every time then that is just really depressing on his part


[09/18/2021 6:48 PM] kx9x#3778
no problem. they are erc20


[09/18/2021 7:15 PM] L Ξ O#5152
cheers. i notice that the balance of the yVault token is equal to amount i had originally deposited. obviously i've accrued some yield since then. as the coin doesn't rebase, and there's no explicit reward claiming, how's the yield tracked exactly?

[09/20/2021 1:20 AM] ataros#7107
do yearn tokens have their interest paid via rebasement? or does the value of the token goes up?


[09/20/2021 1:27 AM] j.#6352
The latter

Yeah me too. Unable to connect with Wallet Connect. I get the same error.


[09/20/2021 9:57 AM] enricoin#5553
Hey, is there a way to know how many transactions are needed to use a vault? And an estimation of their price?


[09/20/2021 10:05 AM] j.#6352
Most of the time, two for vaults new to your wallet address: one for approval to spend/transfer tokens, one to actually deposit tokens


[09/20/2021 10:07 AM] j.#6352
tx cost will depend on what kind of deposit you're doing. if you're depositing the underlying token of a vault, it should be the cheapest it could be, maybe $25 or less for stablecoin vaults. If you're *zapping in* by depositing with a different token than the vault's native/underlying token, it will be more expensive because it will have to do extra actions to get your token swapped, moved, or whatever else, before being deposited in the vault


[09/20/2021 10:09 AM] j.#6352
You can always do a mock transaction by doing an action like approving a token, but not confirming the transaction on Metamask just to see the estimated gas cost


[09/20/2021 10:10 AM] enricoin#5553
Hey, thanks. Very helpful.

[09/20/2021 11:53 PM] j.#6352
Did you do both the approval and the actual deposit transactions or just the first one, the approval?

[09/20/2021 11:57 PM] j.#6352
Did you do one or two transactions?


[09/20/2021 11:57 PM] j.#6352
if one, that's just the first part, the approval. you'll have to do another one for the actual deposit


[09/20/2021 11:57 PM] phenom#9314

I wanted to repay my loan but Yearn.fi doesn't let me in with Wallet Connect.

So I tried through beta.yearn.finance but I'm encountering a different issue over there, the UI doesn't see my ibGBP balance, so I can't repay it there either.

I must wait till I have access to my PC tonight I guess. Usually Metamask works.


[09/21/2021 8:59 AM] j.#6352

Question regarding YFI vault:
https://yearn.finance/vaults/0xE14d13d8B3b85aF791b2AADD661cDBd5E6097Db1

The stated APY is 4.26%, but when I check the contract then I see that none of the YFI is actually being used in any protocol to generate yield. When I check yearn.watch then it seems it has been the case for quite a while (174 days since last report).
Does anyone know if there are any plans to implement a strategy for YFI to actually generate some yield?


[09/21/2021 3:21 PM] kx9x#3778
there is a new yfi vault on ape.tax


[09/21/2021 3:21 PM] kx9x#3778
it isn't in production quite yet


[09/21/2021 3:21 PM] kx9x#3778
but new strats being actively worked on


[09/21/2021 5:03 PM] SafeHarbors#3319
Hi guys, question. I staked sushi on Sushi, then deposited xSushi on yearn when it had xSUSHI in the drop down. (this may not have been correct to do.)

I received an error message: "Zap Failed. Transaction has been reverted by the EVM" with blockHash info, etc.

However, Yearn now shows the appropriate about of SUSHI in that vault and I no longer have xSUSHI in my wallet. 

In order to retrieve my original funds, do I need to swap this sushi back to xSUSHI?


[09/21/2021 5:04 PM] SafeHarbors#3319
And if SUSHI is now in my yearn vault, was the transaction actually successful? (maybe i clicked it twice)


[09/21/2021 5:07 PM] SafeHarbors#3319
when I go to sushi now, it says my address isn't in the bar anymore. Does that mean Yearn withdrew my sushi?


[09/21/2021 5:09 PM] SafeHarbors#3319
ok. i have withdrawn my sushi from yearn. i'm still not sure what the mechanics were behind that series of transactions


[09/21/2021 5:39 PM] Crolev#3404
Thanks for the info. Is there any approximate ETA on the new YFI vault?


[09/21/2021 7:34 PM] vany#0365
when you used xsushi to deposit into the sushi vault that zap would have removed the sushi from xsushi to deposit into the vault then the vault farms with the sushi


[09/21/2021 7:35 PM] vany#0365
zaps dont use your tokens you deposit, it takes the tokens you pick and swap them to the vault token and then deposits


[09/22/2021 1:28 AM] jiong#5502

Hi, I'm integrating yvault, how are management fee and performance fee charged? Are they charged upon deposit or withdraw? Or they're actually reflected in pricePerShare?


[09/22/2021 6:38 AM] Cage#4323
Also I'm writing forked mainnet script to test my integration, say I want to test how much I can earn by deposit 1 inch for 2 years, how can I update the strategy/vault status to reflect the earnings? thanks!

hi, new here and already searched but want to be sure before buying yvBOOST: can I unwrap my yvBOOST to yveCRV to claim the CRV Admin fees? Or can I only zap out via Sushi yvBOOST pool?


[09/23/2021 10:15 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
the yvBOOST vault automatically sells the admin fees, so if you unwrap it you won't be able to claim them retroactively. You'll claim your part in the next snapshot if you want to and still hold yveCRV


[09/23/2021 10:28 AM] jakobiakowe#3888
thanks.. yeah just wanted to know if i can unwrap from yvBOOST into yveCRV without going through sushi/zap


[09/23/2021 10:29 AM] jakobiakowe#3888
but for me the unwrapping is the 'only' value prop of yvBOOST other than that you have to rely on secondary sushi marketplace which can be disconnected from fundamental value of underlying yveCRV


[09/23/2021 12:43 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes, withdrawing from the vault you can do that without using sushi/zap


[09/23/2021 4:47 PM] kx9x#3778
unwrap to yvecrv does not get you any like "past admin fees" for yvboost your admin fees are harvested each Thursday on your behalf and used to make yvboost more valuable (i.e. now you can get more yvecrv for withdraw yvboost)


[09/23/2021 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah you can unwrap from the vault like Richard says


[09/25/2021 1:17 PM] VX#7009
Guys I think I'm miscalculating something. I'm calculating yvMIM*pricePerShare, but the amount of crvMIM I'd get looks off. It gives me a +1% crvMIM in less than 48 hours.

Am I doing anything wrong?

*Okay, I got it. Yearn UI shows the crvMIM amount, not the yvMIM amount.


[09/25/2021 1:43 PM] VX#7009
So there's no need to look at pricePerShare, the shown amounts update automatically.


[09/25/2021 1:52 PM] mlatsa#9080

@Shuvski after the first approval tx, was Metamask automatically called for you to confirm the second tx?


[09/26/2021 12:28 PM] Shuvski#6105
i dont think so


[09/26/2021 12:30 PM] j.#6352

[09/26/2021 12:31 PM] j.#6352

Yea it's both or either sometimes. Weird


[09/26/2021 12:35 PM] Shuvski#6105
not danger?


[09/26/2021 12:36 PM] j.#6352
Meanwhile, i recommend you do this manually through Curve and then Yearn. With the difference between ETH and stETH, you might be able to control or decide on your slippage


[09/26/2021 12:36 PM] arberx#3367
1 question: have you ever used a defi app before?


[09/26/2021 12:36 PM] arberx#3367

You might have missed your 40 gwei window. Monitor gas prices on gasnow.org


[09/26/2021 1:00 PM] j.#6352
You can also stagger the steps done (approve on curve, deposit on curve, approve on yearn, deposit on yearn) if you  want so you can control timing, but maybe more expensive overall


[09/26/2021 1:00 PM] j.#6352

I'm looking at the harvest section in yearn.vision, specifically at the maxReportDelay panel. Is this value coded in the contract?

So that whatever happens, the keeper MUST call the harvest within the shown delay?


[09/27/2021 2:28 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes and can be changed. It’s literally the definition of the variable, so yes it’ll harvested at least once unless it’s extended


[09/27/2021 8:03 PM] bh3180#8034

If you are unhappy with the apy of a vault I would recommend using bowswap.finance to swap to another higher yielding vault

yea 

[09/28/2021 3:20 AM] bh3180#8034
Just that they had a dramatic drop from 12% to 0%, so was surprising to see that from one day to the next. Been at 0% for days now, looked more like a UI issue than an APY issue. But that’s why I wanted to ask.


[09/28/2021 7:14 AM] ONI#6888
The curve voting gauges had a drop in the amount that was voted for them which is why the APY on those pools is now lower

Hello, I invested/zap‑in in yvCurve-EURS https://yearn.fi/invest/0x25212Df29073FfFA7A67399AcEfC2dd75a831A1A. but isn’t it supposed to be a stable coin ? yvCurve-EURS is losing value relative to the EURS stablecoin.


[09/29/2021 10:23 AM] j.#6352
The underlying token of the vault is a liquidity pool token (LP) for the EURS pool on Curve https://curve.fi/eurs


[09/29/2021 10:36 AM] Laël Cellier#4998
Ah yes. And one of the underlying tokens isn’t EURs but sEUR which lost it’s peg. The name on yearn.fi should be relabelled.


[09/29/2021 10:45 AM] j.#6352
The underlying is the Curve EURS pool token. The underlying of the Curve EURS token are EURS and sEUR. It is inferred from the name of the pool, EURS. This can be seen in the link i sent above


[09/29/2021 10:49 AM] Laël Cellier#4998
Ok and now when I try to deposit again, I’m getting `Error Returned error: execution reverted: Error Swapping Tokens 1` even before MetaMask shows up.

[09/29/2021 3:15 PM] Laël Cellier#4998
This wasn’t beta.


[09/29/2021 9:04 PM] VX#7009
Either you mint ibCHF on Yearn.fi by borrowing it, using your USDC as collateral;

 or you convert your USDC to sUSD, then you buy sCHF on Kwenta and swap it to ibCHF on Curve.

Hi guys, I am literally the only user in the newly launched Curve ibGBP vault (0x595a68a8c9D5C230001848B69b1947ee2A607164). I invested around $20k+ almost 5 days ago and it hasn't moved at all, which make sense I guess as the absolute value in the vault does not justify paying the gas for a harvests. I am wondering, in that case, how does it works in term of returns, am I still accruing the underlying rewards but with no compounding till the vault grow bigger? What if I withdraw my deposit, do I keep the rewards or lose it all?


[10/01/2021 12:32 PM] Pragmatic Monkey#1934
(I should have thought about that before putting some money in, but I was not expecting that we vault would not attract liquidity, it's a great one for UK residents)

Hi Aks, hope you are well! remember you from another discord. I have a question if you are still working the Ape.tax strategies? I noticed that a lot of funds are not allocated to a strategy in the yvFTM vault? I see 15M sitting in the vault and like 2mil assigned to the tarot strategy (which is last harvested 5 days ago)?


[10/02/2021 3:29 AM] ONI#6888
The vaults are working as intended and the team is aware of them. Nothing to worry about.

Hi, what is special about Curve EURS? why does it have a 20% apy for a stable coin pool?


[10/02/2021 6:34 AM] krisbit#1526
I have money in the DAI vault, and it shows when I go to the yearn.finance vaults. But when I add the yvDAI token to my wallet, it shows a 0 balance. Does anyone know why this might be?


[10/02/2021 6:46 AM] krisbit#1526
Just fyi, a guy in this discord @Unknown tried to scam me just now, asking for my wallet address and telling me he was a yearn dev who would "run a scan" on my wallet to fix my issue


[10/02/2021 7:15 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
People vote for it in the weekly gauge allocation of curve


[10/02/2021 7:16 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
There are several yvDAI tokens, maybe you’re adding the wrong one. See your address on etherscan and find the right contract address


[10/02/2021 7:34 AM] krisbit#1526
I didn't realize I could do that. Very convenient and easy. Thanks!


[10/02/2021 9:12 AM] Jor#1244
Hmm don't want to be rude, but 15mil sitting idle falls under working as intended? Hope you can give an insight on the content of the question 🙂 thanks in advance

[10/02/2021 9:51 AM] liptu#8490
thanks, who votes for the yearn vaults? is there a way to estimate the votes in the future? does it make sense that the eurs pool has a similar apy like dai, usdc pools in the future?


[10/02/2021 10:31 AM] ONI#6888
We vote to optimize our yield. You can see the future gauge weights at https://dao.curve.fi. Generally yield on vaults can change based on gauge weights so hard to make statements about which vaults will have the best apy


[10/02/2021 1:46 PM] rapha92#6776

Hi. Locking CRV 1:1 for yveCRV is not the most cost-effective (in USD) way to enter the yveCRV vault. While this still has an advantage of earning more weekly rewards than locking the same on Curve, buying yveCRV on Sushiswap is easier and cheaper in USD. yvBOOST even more so


[10/02/2021 11:07 PM] Pragmatic Monkey#1934
Yeah, what I wanted to do eventually was to get into the yvBOOST, but I was not able to zap-in from ETH because of too much slippage (and I thought the zap was looking to buy on Sushiswap), so I walked backward, bought CRV with ETH with the aim to lock the CRV into yveCRV and then deposit those intoe the yvBOOST... series of bad decisions, the worst is that at the start of this whole process, I was a LP in the ETH-yvBOOST pool. Anyway, I thought is was a mistake with the lock smart contract, but actually I think the issue is that it is a 1:1 lock and not a swap and the market value of yveCRV is below CRV likely due to the permanent lock. That was a $2.3k lesson 😫


[10/02/2021 11:09 PM] j.#6352
Ahhhh noooo. Youre right. With your LP, the easiest way would have been to zap out to yvBOOST on Zapper.fi or maybe Zerion.io. The second easiest way would be to exit the LP and buy yvBOOST with the 50% ETH you received


[10/02/2021 11:19 PM] Pragmatic Monkey#1934
Zaping out from Zapper was my first try, but it was not possible (I believe because of slippage), I was getting an error every time. So I did option 2) but then for some reasons ended up doing a succession of bad decision from there. Arghhhh. I guess this has to happen once in a while when you spend so many time in front of your crypto screen 🥲

the last eps related tx


[10/03/2021 3:25 AM] kx9x#3778
yvboost was previously bought off the open market using the USDT rewards from EPS


[10/03/2021 3:25 AM] kx9x#3778
and then days later that yvboost was unwrapped to yvecrv and donated to the yvboost vault


[10/03/2021 3:25 AM] kx9x#3778
so this directly benefited yvboost holders

that shouldn't even use a zap, weird


[10/04/2021 2:03 PM] kx9x#3778
you can also try yearn.fi or beta.yearn.finance for withdrawing


[10/04/2021 2:03 PM] kx9x#3778
yearn.fi is run by Andre and Anton


[10/04/2021 2:04 PM] kx9x#3778
beta.yearn.finance is the new version of the yearn website currently in beta


[10/04/2021 2:09 PM] kx9x#3778
or can even try the zapper site directly


[10/04/2021 3:29 PM] slayer_hellraiser#5093
Same error on https://yearn.fi/ and on beta site too

if you need to withdraw ASAP, you can also do so directly through etherscan if you are comfortable with that

Hmm, same error 
``Error: [object Object]``

aight, then this is due to your wallet

you should visit Ledger support if possible


[10/04/2021 3:41 PM] kx9x#3778

Correct


[10/05/2021 6:59 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
How long does yfi have to be staked? And how are the 300% in CRV rewards paid out ?


[10/05/2021 7:02 AM] j.#6352
There are no time locks on any deposit. where do you see 300%?


[10/05/2021 7:03 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
When you go to Yearn.Finance.com

[10/05/2021 7:04 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
It was 298% yesterday, today I guess 320%


[10/05/2021 7:05 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
It doesn't say what specific percentage each vault offers either. So how do I know where to stake with the best percentage?


[10/05/2021 7:06 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
And is the 320% apy on the amount you invest? Would that turn 1 million in to 3 million (for example)


[10/05/2021 7:08 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
Or is it an Apr or neither?.. nothing about it is very clear.. is it a fixed term rate of some sort?


[10/05/2021 7:10 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
And how much are the weekly fees normally and what part do they play in rewarding you for staking. Do other people pay fees on a certain platform and it is distributed + 320% to whatever vault you choose.. ?


[10/05/2021 7:11 AM] j.#6352
go to the vaults page. there should be a column labeled APY. you'll see this for all vaults available. also, i wouldnt recommend using mobile for anything DeFi, but you can also try the new UI on beta.yearn.finance. I think they've done some improvements for mobile displays


[10/05/2021 7:12 AM] j.#6352
not fixed. everything fluctuates constantly


[10/05/2021 7:12 AM] j.#6352
https://docs.yearn.finance/yearn-finance/yvaults/overview#yvault-fee-structure


[10/05/2021 7:13 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
Ok, I'll take a look, thanks


[10/05/2021 7:14 AM] j.#6352
:waifu:


[10/05/2021 7:43 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
But it still doesn't explain what the mobile web version is saying about 320% more in weekly fees. Is that a good thing I'm guessing and what does it apply to. Or does it mean nothing and it's empty hype?


[10/05/2021 7:43 AM] j.#6352
this is about the yveCRV vault


[10/05/2021 7:44 AM] j.#6352
https://hackmd.io/zQLVeWGOSk-NWelM0zuLNQ


[10/05/2021 7:46 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
The desktop version seems to have even less information. And instead of saying how much you could earn aside from some less exciting screenshot shots of 1-6% is saying how much fees will be imposed on your deposit and will not let you withdraw at a loss so your money will be stuck there until a harvest that is at minimum what you deposited after fees.. so I could stake my money for a few months and be happy just to get back my original deposit?

are we looking at the same website?


[10/05/2021 7:54 AM] j.#6352
this is more than enough information for me to make a decision


[10/05/2021 7:56 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
Yes, it says CRV pays out at a value of $1.00 but it's trading on Gemini for almost $3.. is that why it's saying an extra 320% in rewards, because the price is inflated right now?


[10/05/2021 7:57 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
The last time it was $1 00 though was in January


[10/05/2021 7:57 AM] j.#6352
https://curve.fi/


[10/05/2021 7:57 AM] j.#6352

[10/05/2021 7:58 AM] j.#6352
320% *more*


[10/05/2021 7:58 AM] j.#6352
0.07 x 3.20 = yveCRV APY


[10/05/2021 8:01 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
Nvm, I see 3crv is a separate coin. I only use the Gemini exchange, but I recently opened a trust wallet so I could deposit into a yearn vault, but I don't know what percentage it offers, it only gives the option to deposit or withdraw with no other information provided


[10/05/2021 8:02 AM] j.#6352
:waifu:


[10/05/2021 8:03 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
If I click on show more it shows me deposit & withdraw, if I click on the yfi symbol it takes me to an ether scan wallet with 48 billion worth of yfi

So on I was voting for MIM pool with me veCRV and received $spell rewards on bribe.crv.finance that I didn’t claim due to high gas. Then I changed my vote to USDN and got some rewards as well. Now I don’t see my $spell rewards on the bribe website anymore, is there a way I can claim them?

Do I have to change my vote back to MIM pool?


[10/05/2021 11:46 AM] kx9x#3778
you want to claim rewards for something you changed your vote on?


[10/05/2021 11:46 AM] kx9x#3778
sorry, I am having trouble understand this


[10/05/2021 11:46 AM] kx9x#3778
you voted on the MIM pool, saw rewards


[10/05/2021 11:46 AM] kx9x#3778
changed your vote from MIM to USDN


[10/05/2021 11:47 AM] kx9x#3778
and you still expect rewards for the MIM pool? I thought you only got rewards for pools that you vote for.


[10/05/2021 11:47 AM] kx9x#3778
are you talking about different weeks or something?


[10/05/2021 12:24 PM] martenJ#0334
yes, I voted for MIM, got rewards that I didn't claim yet, changed the vote to USDN got rewards for that one as well, but now my MIM/$SPELL rewards "disappeared" from the bribe website

Hi, i m not able to borrow from 3crv from Lend section.

i use metamask

i do not use hardware wallet.

and i have this error 

"Error: execution reverted: borrow is paused { "originalError": { "code": 3, "data": "0x08c379a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010626f72726f772069732070617573656400000000000000000000000000000000", "message": "execution reverted: borrow is paused" } }"

problem seems only occur to 3crv ...

as soon as i hit borrow, the error pops up.

if i choose other coins to borrow, the problem dont seem to occur... and i m directed to the metamask confirm button


[10/06/2021 3:26 AM] vany#0365

Hey Frens... Is there a good way to query the yvUSDC and yvDAI prices to pull into a google sheet? They don't seem to be listed on coingecko.


[10/06/2021 11:58 AM] Ross 💽#2221
also, in zapper, I see a quantity number and a price that match, even though it looks like the share price of USDC is actually 1.0769. Is that an issue in zapper or does the vault show the dollar amount and not the share amount?


[10/06/2021 12:00 PM] Ross 💽#2221
ah, I'll go ahead and answer my own question. I queried the contract and can confirm that zapper shows USD value and not shares


[10/06/2021 12:55 PM] kx9x#3778
you'd need to somehow call the yvUSDC and yvDAI contracts via google sheets and get their pricePerShare


[10/06/2021 12:57 PM] Ross 💽#2221
ok. that's what I figured. thanks!

Hi there, hoping you can help with a query. I wanted to deposit some Aave in the vaults and a transaction went through of "Approve Aave Spend" but the Aave is still in my wallet and not showing up as a withdrawal from Yearn. I've probably made a noob mistake but just wanted to check first if this is an error before paying more gas? Thanks


[10/08/2021 7:11 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
you need to approve first and then deposit, therefore you have to send to transactions


[10/08/2021 7:17 AM] Jamie#0250
Thanks Richard,  from having a look back through.. thought that might have been the case!

what is WFTM vault strategy and expected apy?


[10/08/2021 12:40 PM] j.#6352
You'll see both of these on the website very soon!


[10/08/2021 12:42 PM] YellowOwl#1789
great looking forward. 
where are strategies usually explained? I just want to see if it would be better than FTM staking itself, since my lock expired recently and wondering if i should relock or wait for yearn 🙂


[10/08/2021 12:44 PM] j.#6352
I usually check yearn.watch for this, but Fantom vaults have not yet been added. The strategy names should give you a good idea what each one does.


[10/08/2021 12:45 PM] vany#0365
They are on ape.tax

Apy will be lower currently but as we add more strategies with higher expected apr that should improve

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[10/08/2021 2:33 PM] LeZ#3132

Hello y'all. New yearn user here. I zapped in (correct use of that verbage?) some ETH to the yvBoost - ETH "asset" and it ended up fine in the pickle farm, but it's not displayed under "Holdings" in the yearn.finance interface. Holdings show 0.0. Is that expected?


[10/08/2021 2:49 PM] j.#6352
Yes. Go to pickle.finance to see your deposit


[10/08/2021 2:50 PM] Just Jake#9504
Great, thanks for confirming! In which case would the Holdings show any value for this vault?


[10/08/2021 2:51 PM] j.#6352
I think that's when you have the ETH/yvBOOST SLP on Sushiswap instead of pSLP which is on Pickle


[10/08/2021 3:04 PM] Just Jake#9504
Is it strange that I find this unintuitive? I thought that for this vault the SLP would eventually always be deposited on Pickle, the pSLP, so you will never have the ETH/yvBOOST LP on Sushiswap?


[10/08/2021 3:07 PM] j.#6352
Not sure. I might be wrong. It might never display anything ever since the end result of this zap will always be in pickle.finance.


[10/08/2021 3:11 PM] j.#6352
the v3 site https://beta.yearn.finance/#/labs should be better for that


[10/08/2021 3:14 PM] Just Jake#9504

Regarding Yearn Iron Bank on FTM ( https://beta.yearn.finance/#/ironbank ): put some funds there and activated them as collateral.

Wanted to borrow against it: borrowing transaction successfully mined, but it doesnt do anything? Still got no tokens (tried to borrow YFI) which I wanted to borrow and the borrow limit is unchanged too; tried twice, same result.


[10/09/2021 8:40 AM] Johnny F#4404
Possibly related: on CREAM, the max deposit limit for the token seems to have been met with my deposit. So not using ironbank on the yearn site, but trying to do the same thing on Cream fails as well. Though in that case, there's no successful borrowing transaction, it wont even let me borrow anything in the UI in the first place.
Could this be the same underlying issue, not handled by the Ironbank UI?


[10/09/2021 10:37 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
Do you guys have a channel to just talk about the price of the yearn token, updates on the project that would possibly increase the price of the token.. I've been trying to locate some type of community where that's what they care about and talk about, ways to increase interest, promote it, discuss the future of it and how those last few coins will be released and what happens when all are in circulation.. I feel like the official discord has no category dedicated to the token.. it's about literally everything else.. there are more people talking about the alt coins that have merged or were created from yearn..


[10/09/2021 10:39 AM] SharonIsQueen#7543
It's very annoying. I keep bringing up yearn.finance tokens in multiple channels and I am pretty much ignored..  maybe I need to find an off hinge fan club since the official discord is uninterested

Yes.
This might be a UI thing that yearn doesnt handle, but Cream does, see https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/734811808401063966/896361586934030356 for more info


[10/10/2021 3:49 AM] Johnny F#4404
The strategies it uses are Tarot lending and scream lending... when looking at the underlying protocol returns, i would expect a 50-80% APY for yvWFTM


[10/10/2021 4:01 AM] kx9x#3778
Only at full allocation. Scream has 20% of the vault. A new tarot strat is being worked on and that one you see has 0% allocated


[10/10/2021 4:01 AM] kx9x#3778
Geist due diligence might be done this weekend


[10/10/2021 4:07 AM] kx9x#3778
Weird, I was able to borrow YFI rather easily just now 🤷‍♂️


[10/10/2021 4:08 AM] kx9x#3778
What do you mean about max deposit limit? Are you trying to borrow more than you can safely do? Are you trying to borrow more than there is supply?


[10/10/2021 4:17 AM] kx9x#3778
If you are borrowing more than the supply, then that should be obvious why that doesn't work. The yearn UI should match cream behavior though and not let you even submit that TX


[10/10/2021 4:17 AM] kx9x#3778

Thank you so much. I minted MIM at abracadabra with yvWFTM. Is there any way how much I earned?


[10/10/2021 4:59 AM] Johnny F#4404
"Max deposit limit" as in it just wont accept my AAVE as collateral, because it seems there's too much AAVE above some Cream protocol limit already (only visible in Cream UI, yearn UI shows nothing about this)


[10/10/2021 5:00 AM] Johnny F#4404
That's a question for abracadabra, I dont know. At first, you probably are in the red, because minting MIM has one-time costs, so it will only be profitable over some time


[10/10/2021 5:27 AM] alfs#1812
what is on-time costs? sorry for many questions..🥲


[10/10/2021 5:38 AM] petroscyp80#9032
I know probaply has been answered but I ll ask anyway because I did not find it ! I entered ape.tax for about bit more than a week because I saw the strategies and I considered it to be the best thing right now in Fantom ! Every how long there is harvest to improve price share? Tarot price went down so how that affects ,if it affects the whole strategy since one of them is lending ! I still believe we are here early and rewards will come sooner than expected!


[10/10/2021 5:38 AM] petroscyp80#9032
I borrowed also from abracadabra

nice, now put that into tarot for like 63% apy


[10/10/2021 4:00 PM] petroscyp80#9032
Actually I used what I bought to swap mim with ftm and I again zap in ape.tax because of the high apy !


[10/10/2021 4:02 PM] petroscyp80#9032
I just have them there now sitting  and the interest tokens all as collateral in abracadabra


[10/10/2021 4:14 PM] petroscyp80#9032
Where can someone put into tarot ? In the tarot.to and in form of lending or farming ?


[10/10/2021 4:15 PM] kx9x#3778
just find the MIM pair with highest supply apy


[10/10/2021 4:16 PM] kx9x#3778
click it, click the lend tab, approve and supply


[10/10/2021 4:19 PM] petroscyp80#9032
I ll do this now ! I can borrow  more from abracadabra since I already have all colateral there and use mim also for tarot.to ! About ape.tax is better u think to leave my ftm there until everything sorts out ! I mean I get profit or waste of time ?


[10/10/2021 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
profit isn't high or anything yet. right now I just keep my ftm in the vault and borrow MIM and put into tarot


[10/10/2021 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
just know that you are leveraged on FTM right now, so make sure you watch FTM price


[10/10/2021 4:25 PM] petroscyp80#9032
Yes I know and try to be safe not borrowing too much but because I did not know the situation with ape.tax I thought getting more ftm and work more ape.tax would be better ! I ll get for now a small percentage of the rest of my allowed borrowing from abracadabra and hope everything would be ok until I see profit !


[10/10/2021 4:42 PM] petroscyp80#9032
I did that pressed lend tab in ftm-mim pair and approve and supply my borrowed mim at mim tab! Do I have to do something else ?


[10/10/2021 4:42 PM] kx9x#3778
nope, now you are earning


[10/10/2021 4:43 PM] kx9x#3778
only way to track your earnings is to just write down your supplied MIM


[10/10/2021 4:43 PM] kx9x#3778
you basically just auto compound


[10/10/2021 4:43 PM] kx9x#3778
so you will see your MIM supplied go up over time


[10/10/2021 4:46 PM] petroscyp80#9032
Wish I knew that before I put all ftm at ape.tax ? Is there a way to reverse what I did to divide in this two ape.tax and tarot.to or better just leave them as I did? What would u do in my place ?


[10/10/2021 5:08 PM] kx9x#3778
I would probably just get back to a 1x leveraged position but has ftm dropped since you bought it with borrowed MIM?


[10/10/2021 5:08 PM] kx9x#3778
Might just be fine to wait until ftm pumps a bit before repaying and getting back no leverage


[10/10/2021 5:09 PM] kx9x#3778
My position is all my ftm in the vault and borrowing mim to put into tarot


[10/10/2021 5:16 PM] petroscyp80#9032
I was buying ftm from 1.30 until 2 $ bit by bit ! My problem is that I exchange my mim to ftm using spirit swap and again put them as colateral to get more mim to turn into ftm ! Not sure how I can get out if I don’t see profit from this ! 🙄

Hi everyone, for the past three days I’ve been trying to withdraw from a yearn vault, but the usual plus and minus buttons next to my current deposits on the Vaults page aren’t there any longer? How do I withdraw?


[10/11/2021 5:46 AM] meech#9169
Hi all - I’m wondering if you can send yv tokens from one eth wallet to another. When you think connect to the yearn protocol will it still recognize your same assets ?


[10/11/2021 6:01 AM] meech#9169
And in a similar fashion, can you send say, half, your yv token to another wallet and thereby have half of the vault assets pertain to each wallet


[10/11/2021 7:51 AM] j.#6352
Yes. Vault tokens are ERC20 tokens


[10/11/2021 7:51 AM] j.#6352
Yes

Hi guys, i recently deposited USDT into the vault and 3 days later my deposited balance is zero. Do you guys know what might have happened?


[10/11/2021 2:08 PM] j.#6352
Make sure that you actually did the deposit and not just the approval deposit before it

No i actually did, I even got the yvUSDT and used it as collateral for borrowing MIM.


[10/11/2021 2:14 PM] kx9x#3778
you deposited it into abracabadra as collateral and expect to see it where?

you need to use abra to see your collateral. you sent your vault tokens to them and it makes total sense that your deposited balance would show as 0.

Noticing for yearn on ethereum you must deposit MIM-3LP3CRV token but for yearn on fantom it just mentions MIM. Does this mean with fantom I can just deposit mim? No extra step (and gas) of acquiring curve pool tokens? Or is this just a yearn UI issue


[10/11/2021 7:46 PM] kx9x#3778
for the ftm vault deposit MIM directly

yveCRV-ETH is a pool on Sushiswap so APY is from trading fees. Not sure if farming SUSHI in Onsen is still a thing, but that's more yield on top of fees. yveCRV yield is from weekly 3crv rewards claimed from Curve. yvBOOST-ETH is a pool on Sushiswap like yveCRV-ETH, but there's also additional yield from farming Sushi, autocompounding on Pickle Finance, and staking for PICKLE on Pickle Finance


[10/12/2021 12:45 AM] VictorW#3329
Thanks. And now i get all apy from the net_apy field except these 3 vaults. i found the data in vaults api, but the ui don't use it. I wonder why. Is it because the data is questionable or is there another way to get and calculate the apy the web ui shows


[10/12/2021 12:59 AM] j.#6352

@saltyfacu Hi! Do I get it right that YFI token on Fantom is just a bridged version of YFI token on ETH and no special emission of YFI token on Fantom was made?


[10/12/2021 11:50 AM] kx9x#3778
Special emission? This is just bridged. No extra supply.

I'm not seeing mine for POLYGON-A3CRV either.  Looks like so far only spell/unit people are claiming https://etherscan.io/tokentxns?a=0x7893bbb46613d7a4fbcc31dab4c9b823ffee1026.  If you want to see if you have rewards waiting you can use `claimable` method on contract directly https://etherscan.io/address/0x7893bbb46613d7a4fbcc31dab4c9b823ffee1026#readContract (you'll have to figure out what the gauge + reward token addresses are -- I'm not familiar with am pool).  Mine shows 0 which is a bit worrisome, I switched my vote ~20 min before expiry...hope I didn't miss it somehow.

[10/14/2021 2:56 AM] jacobm#0625
Ok think I figured this out -- someone has to call `_update_period` for the gauge/reward before rewards appear as claimable.  This happens either when reward is added for the next period or the 1st person to claim for that specific guage/reward.  I just blindly fired claim_rewards for POLYGON-A3CRV for myself and got the reward even though claimable was returning 0 for me.

@ONI Hello.
Do I get it right that the only treasury of your protocol is on Ethereum? Who is paying for bridging these tokens to other blockchains: users who claim them or Yearn?
To be more specific: if a user participates in liquidity provision to Yearn on Fantom and stakes his LP tokens, he is eligible to receive YFI tokens as rewards. So do I get it right that Yearn as a protocol bears the cost of minting these rewards on Ethereum and bridging them on Fantom?


[10/15/2021 11:24 AM] j.#6352
The vaults are on Fantom. Your question reads like Ethereum vaults are bridged to Fantom, which is not the case. There are no YFI staking and rewards currently


[10/15/2021 11:39 AM] ONI#6888
ugh for now no vaults are crosschain as J says, also there is no liquidity mining for YFI unless you contribute to yearn.


[10/15/2021 11:39 AM] ONI#6888
yearn doesnt have rewards we give our vault users so... yah. we farm yield from elsewhere only and compound it for our users.


[10/15/2021 11:54 AM] j.#6352

As @pbnather said in #✔v3-ui-feedback, if all of your yvWFTM is deposited in Abracadabra, you wont see your deposit in Yearn...because your tokens are in Abracadabra

[10/15/2021 12:31 PM] kx9x#3778
I think these questions are getting a bit off-topic for yearn's support channel as an FYI. We might not be best fit to help with reaper farm and abracadabra


[10/15/2021 12:31 PM] kx9x#3778
In any case, you always need to approve a smart contract to spend your ERC20 token such as MIM


[10/15/2021 12:32 PM] kx9x#3778
before it can actually spend it. That has been a standard in Ethereum (and its clones) smart contracts for a very long time now.


[10/15/2021 12:34 PM] kx9x#3778
The approve button you are seeing on the abracadabra dashboard is related to the bentobox and that approval has nothing to do with things you might do with your MIM. If you take your MIM to reaper, you will need an approval there. If you take it to tarot, you need another approval. If you put it into yearn's MIM vault for yvMIM, then that also needs its own approval.


[10/15/2021 12:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks for your help. Just wanted to know if I needed to select the approve. I understand you need to approve a ton. I received message from Metamask saying I was giving permission for them to spend MIM. I had never seen a message like that. Thanks again


[10/15/2021 11:28 PM] ONI#6888
You have to explicitly approve every erc20 for every new contract on eth.

I meant gas used not total fee


[10/16/2021 10:04 PM] vany#0365
it depends as well. will the zap need to trade or deposit anywhere? I'd suggest going to the contract on etherscan and look at recent "zap-in" transactions to see how much gas it uses

If you are trying to like manually set your gas limit, then be careful!

$885???

welcome to ethereum


[10/17/2021 3:24 AM] kx9x#3778
how much gas is that using?


[10/17/2021 3:29 AM] kx9x#3778
I am seeing like 35% gas used on some bowswap TXs


[10/17/2021 3:30 AM] kx9x#3778
yeah, it will be more like 0.07eth


[10/17/2021 3:30 AM] kx9x#3778
quite a lot


[10/17/2021 3:30 AM] kx9x#3778
so maybe like in the $200 range


[10/17/2021 3:30 AM] kx9x#3778
but no guarantee, depends on gas used


[10/17/2021 3:39 AM] BHo Show#3145
you know the custom token for yvCurve-LINK?

[10/17/2021 3:42 AM] kx9x#3778
I just googled yvCurve-LINK


[10/17/2021 3:48 AM] BHo Show#3145
ok thanks I thought I needed more info I guess not, do you happen to know why yearn.finance would show a larger holding than my metamask wallet for the same token or what bowswap is showing?  Is there a portion locked up I can't withdraw is that the reason?  and what's the time frame if so when you can remove that?


[10/17/2021 3:53 AM] kx9x#3778
Yearn finance is probably showing the underlying curve token amount and bowswap is probably showing the vault token amount, which are different


[10/17/2021 3:53 AM] kx9x#3778
You should be able to withdraw all. No locking up


[10/17/2021 3:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes im an idiot sorry


[10/17/2021 3:57 AM] BHo Show#3145
ok that's probably what it is but where can I locate more info on this so I know what value each one should be at to confirm the amounts are correct

1 yvCurve-Link = 1015764501718117121 / 10^18 = ~1.01576 crvLink


[10/17/2021 3:59 AM] kx9x#3778
so if you divide the number you see on yearn and the number on bowswap, it is probably that ratio

after signing a message i'm getting a swap failed from yvcurvelink to yvLINK token, any suggestions or things to look for ?

maybe a hardware wallet or metamask setting?

Hi, I deposited some usdc to the usdc vault on fantom beta 13 hours ago, the earned amount is still zero - when it updates?


[10/17/2021 4:42 AM] dweezil#0486
when trying to withdraw from the USDC vault, how much USDC do you typically need to be able to withdraw successfully?

does there need to be more sitting the vault than you're trying to withdraw?


[10/17/2021 4:55 AM] kx9x#3778
hi again, I think I helped you over at morpheus


[10/17/2021 4:56 AM] kx9x#3778
currently those vaults should harvest daily, but it is currently done by strategists rather than automation. you can keep your eyes peeled in the #🤖code-changes-log chat for a "daily ftm" change


[10/17/2021 4:57 AM] kx9x#3778
if it takes too long until the next one, I can ping the strategists to get them to trigger it


[10/17/2021 4:58 AM] kx9x#3778
not usually since withdraws can pull from the strategy but since there is a bug in the withdrawal of the levcomp strategy that was found today, you do actually have to withdraw from the funds sitting in the vault contract


[10/17/2021 4:58 AM] kx9x#3778
the strategists for that committee know about this and they understand the issue, not sure what their mitigation will be


[10/17/2021 4:58 AM] kx9x#3778
but they are all asleep now anyway


[10/17/2021 4:59 AM] kx9x#3778
for now your best best is to wait until someone deposits and then withdraw once there is enough for you. not ideal, but a workaround


[10/17/2021 4:59 AM] dweezil#0486
got it. i'll try later. thanks for your help


[10/17/2021 6:53 AM] Cao#2235
Thanks again man good to see you. So the strategists compound the usdc via scream and the deposits earn some yield right?  If the vault does what he does seeing or not seeing to earning figure now is not crucial.


[10/17/2021 2:47 PM] kx9x#3778
Yeah, there is yield from scream and cream.

Make sure that you did the actual deposit transaction, the second of two transactions you have to do when interacting with a new smart contract. The first is the approval transaction

Ah then nothing to worry about. having the vault tokens in your wallet means you have a deposit in Yearn


[10/18/2021 3:06 AM] <--70% down#1778
but balance is not showing when the click the wFTM withdrawal on vault page, is this a network problem or dapp issue?

Everyone with inquiries about *missing FTM vault deposits*, if you used Abracadabra, you will see your deposit in there, not in Yearn. This is not a Yearn issue.

I sent some eth to the wallet now but can't find how to swap it to the other tokens


[10/18/2021 6:24 AM] Revrart#3126
I guess I should have sent it to the vault directly. Anyway to transfer this internally instead of from the eth in yearn -> metamask ->vault in yearn?


[10/18/2021 6:24 AM] Revrart#3126
Gonna burn all my money in gas


[10/18/2021 6:31 AM] j.#6352
Your questions read as if your wallet is exclusively on Yearn. This is not the case. You can use this wallet on any dapp on Ethereum. With ETH in your Metamask wallet, you can use any of the Yearn vaults you're interested in


[10/18/2021 6:33 AM] Revrart#3126
I see, the tab was called wallet


[10/18/2021 6:34 AM] Revrart#3126

[10/18/2021 6:34 AM] Revrart#3126

You can borrow against some vault tokens, if you're interested in borrowing and lending. Try Unit or Abracadabra. https://unit.xyz/ https://abracadabra.money/


[10/18/2021 6:48 AM] Revrart#3126
Ok, it sounded in the faq that you could zap anything to the tokens used


[10/18/2021 7:40 AM] Revrart#3126

[10/18/2021 8:02 AM] j.#6352
Yes this is possible, but if you zap from your yvWETH into some other token, that would be the same as withdrawing and selling ETH for that other token


[10/18/2021 8:03 AM] j.#6352
This is an approval transaction, one of two transactions you need to do whenever you interact with a new smart contract. First is the approval. Second is the actual spend/deposit


[10/18/2021 8:04 AM] Revrart#3126
But I pressed the withdraw button. So it should withdraw?


[10/18/2021 8:04 AM] Revrart#3126
Or how do I get my ether back?


[10/18/2021 8:04 AM] j.#6352
Why are you withdrawing only hours after depositing?


[10/18/2021 8:05 AM] Revrart#3126

[10/18/2021 8:05 AM] j.#6352
Click withdraw.


[10/18/2021 8:05 AM] j.#6352
as i described above, you've only done the first part, the approval to spend.


[10/18/2021 8:05 AM] Revrart#3126

[10/18/2021 8:05 AM] Revrart#3126

[10/18/2021 8:09 AM] j.#6352
You can do this manually by withdrawing/zapping out, then depositing/zapping into the Curve cvxCRV vault. You can also check https://bowswap.finance if ETH vault to Curve cvxCRV vault is possible. Bowswap allows one click migration/swap of vault deposits


[10/18/2021 8:11 AM] Revrart#3126

If I don't want to burn them up with gas.


[10/18/2021 8:21 AM] j.#6352
Zapping your ETH into Curve cvxCRV will sell your ETH


[10/18/2021 8:21 AM] j.#6352

[10/18/2021 8:22 AM] Revrart#3126
I need to approve that in the vault?


[10/18/2021 8:22 AM] Revrart#3126
Now it is just doing nothing?


[10/18/2021 8:22 AM] j.#6352
If you've done the deposit, you dont need to do anything else


[10/18/2021 8:24 AM] Revrart#3126
Why did I need to approve the yvETH?


[10/18/2021 8:25 AM] Revrart#3126
(The approval I did when I pressed withdraw). Now in curve it says:


[10/18/2021 8:25 AM] j.#6352
Because you wanted to withdraw/zap out. This happens when your wallet address has not interacted with the zap out contract before

Ok. So the story. I wanted to get some curve or similar. I put ether in the vault so I could swap/zap into something else. Since "it was so easy". Then I understood that it was not possible without lending or borrowing with abracadabra or similar. So I deposited directly to Curve EURs and the contract did its magic

This sounds more complicated that necessary


[10/18/2021 8:32 AM] Revrart#3126
So two deposits from my wallet. One ETH->ETH (vault) and one ETH->Curve EURS


[10/18/2021 8:32 AM] Revrart#3126
Yes it feels complicated


[10/18/2021 8:32 AM] ONI#6888
What coin did you start with? What base asset do you want to hold? Eth stables btc? What do you want?


[10/18/2021 8:32 AM] j.#6352
You dont have to use the vaults if you'll be swapping to other tokens in the end


[10/18/2021 8:32 AM] Revrart#3126
I only have ETH


[10/18/2021 8:32 AM] Revrart#3126
And I wanted "in" on the yearn contracts with curve etc


[10/18/2021 8:33 AM] Revrart#3126
Some small investments


[10/18/2021 8:33 AM] ONI#6888
That doesn't make any sense. You want to deposit ur eth into the highest yielding curve eth vault?


[10/18/2021 8:33 AM] Revrart#3126
So I started with ETH and pressed deposit. Felt correct in my world


[10/18/2021 8:33 AM] ONI#6888
Yes and now your in the eth vault making yield


[10/18/2021 8:34 AM] Revrart#3126
Why not? What am I missing. I want to earn as much as possible?


[10/18/2021 8:34 AM] ONI#6888
It's making the highest risk-adjusted yield it can with your eth


[10/18/2021 8:34 AM] j.#6352
*Yearn: DeFi made easy*


[10/18/2021 8:34 AM] ONI#6888
Curve pools have more risks like slippage in and out


[10/18/2021 8:34 AM] Revrart#3126
Yes and that is fine. But if you compare the 25% Yearly with 2% I can put the risk with some money


[10/18/2021 8:34 AM] ONI#6888
But higher apy


[10/18/2021 8:34 AM] j.#6352
you really dont have to do anything else. it sounds like you want to do more actions than necessary


[10/18/2021 8:35 AM] ONI#6888
Ok then go to bowswap.finance and swap eth vault to curve steth or curve seth vault


[10/18/2021 8:35 AM] ONI#6888
For the highest apy on eth base we offer


[10/18/2021 8:35 AM] Revrart#3126
Hmm. Or should I just let it be as it is? I have two positions now. One "low" risk with ether and one high with curve


[10/18/2021 8:36 AM] Revrart#3126
My question is maybe. Can I leave it now and see what happens


[10/18/2021 8:36 AM] Revrart#3126

I will go back to the documentation now and read more. Apparently I do not get it all.

[10/18/2021 8:38 AM] j.#6352
Ser, you really dont need to do anything else. That's what the vaults are for.


[10/18/2021 8:38 AM] ONI#6888
You had eth, you deposited into the eth vault. Now you're earning yield.


[10/18/2021 8:38 AM] ONI#6888
Simple


[10/18/2021 8:39 AM] Revrart#3126
Yes, but that was not my first intention. And it was "to be so easy" with zap and swap and pickles. Sorry. So I don't want to end up in a bad place. Thanks for your help anyway


[10/18/2021 8:40 AM] ONI#6888
What was your intention?


[10/18/2021 8:40 AM] Revrart#3126
To use my ETH to finance some high APY vault


[10/18/2021 8:41 AM] ONI#6888
Then why did you deposit into the eth vault which shows 2.2% apy?


[10/18/2021 8:41 AM] Revrart#3126
And my misstake was that I thought the platform could swap the ether to whatever I decided next


[10/18/2021 8:41 AM] Revrart#3126
I did not understand I needed to swap it before I


[10/18/2021 8:41 AM] Revrart#3126
Is that hard to understand?


[10/18/2021 8:41 AM] j.#6352
You did this for Curve EURS


[10/18/2021 8:41 AM] ONI#6888
If you go to the vault page each vault has a apy


[10/18/2021 8:42 AM] Revrart#3126
Yes I did it with curve. But that was by depositing Curve and state ETH as my source


[10/18/2021 8:42 AM] ONI#6888
You can deposit the base token or any other token via 'zaps' but you have to do this in that vault not another vault.


[10/18/2021 8:42 AM] Revrart#3126
Yes I understand that now.


[10/18/2021 8:43 AM] Revrart#3126
I falsely thought that was possible between vaults


[10/18/2021 8:43 AM] Revrart#3126
So sorry for not undertstanding


[10/18/2021 8:43 AM] ONI#6888
Well if you want to change vaults use bowswap and it will close a bit but it's best if you want to be in a different vault


[10/18/2021 8:43 AM] ONI#6888
Bowswap.finance is for swapping between vaults


[10/18/2021 8:44 AM] Revrart#3126
Last time I did stuff with Ether it was on $4. It is a new world now. And I want to understand it. This feels really interesting. But the diversity of tools is huge


[10/18/2021 8:45 AM] j.#6352
It really is huge


[10/18/2021 8:45 AM] ONI#6888
But it will cost 50 to 150$ I think to zap to another vault.


[10/18/2021 8:45 AM] Revrart#3126
Yeah, I noticed that. And that is what I wanted to avoid. But again. Thanks for your time.


[10/18/2021 8:45 AM] ONI#6888
Also generally with eth fees where they are I would say only try to yield farm / use defi stuff if you have over 5k as fees are expensive sadly


[10/18/2021 8:46 AM] ONI#6888
Cannot avoid it on eth mainnet


[10/18/2021 8:46 AM] ONI#6888
Maybe on fantom, Polygon, or l2s

Hello there. I've failed to withdraw from the TUSD v1 pool. So here's my question. I click on the "Withdraw All" button on yearn.finance, it pops up Metamask saying that estimated gas fee is 0.06 ETH. And a maximum gas fee at 2x that. I'm fine with that. Is it save to proceed? What are the chances that the transaction will not succeed and I'll lose my ETH? kthx


[10/18/2021 9:12 AM] hellfried#0791
Now it says requires 0.08 ETH. lol


[10/18/2021 9:57 AM] j.#6352
As long as you have more than enough ETH to pay for gas, whatever the estimate is, the tx will confirm


[10/18/2021 9:58 AM] hellfried#0791
Cool. What’s more than enough? When it _doesn’t _ say Insufficient funds, is that when I have more than enough?

The yvTUSD vault is currently not withdrawing from the strategy as it only has 1 strategy and the utilization on it, that kashi pool, is at 100%. Sorry for the inconvenience. 

For now all you can do is wait if you would like to withdrawal from the vault, we are looking into if there is anything we can do at the moment, thanks for your patience.

Excuse me.  I can't see rewards on bribe.crv. I voted for polygon-a3CRV but the page of voting for polygon-a3CRV disappeared. where should i go to claim my rewards?


[10/21/2021 1:03 AM] kx9x#3778
you can’t claim in the same week you vote, so if you vote before you claim then your claim goes away

so you should always do
- claim
- vote

Hi guys. I sent my ETH to an ETH vault. In beta.yearn.finance it shows up at the top and totals but not in the ETH vault listed. I think it’s in a vault that isn’t listed. Can you help me find it?  Thanks! 🖖


[10/21/2021 4:11 AM] DerinJapan#8325
I should add I have two other vaults I’m using that show up separately and I can click through to those. Just the ETH vault is missing.

Hello! I have a question about the new FTM vaults - I deposited some FTM yesterday. The beta.yearn.finance site is not recognizing my MM wallet today. Any idea what's happening?


[10/21/2021 2:44 PM] j.#6352
As in your wallet wont connect? Your wallet address is not shown on the top right?


[10/21/2021 3:00 PM] Lien#4044
Sorry. This was my own fault. My Xdefi wallet was set for priority which caused the MM connection issue. All good now. Thanks for your reply.

Can you query the yearn vaults subgraph from the graph's playground?  Looking for a sample query to pull information about a specific vault.  Say the ETH one


[10/21/2021 10:53 PM] PrinceDragon#3779
Hi all, newbie question 😊
Let's say I deposit  in the steth vault,then goto Abra to deposit my yvcrv-steth and borrow MIM, a year later I repay the mim token and get my year Steth back.
Will I still earn any yield in this period with my yvcrvSteth?


[10/21/2021 10:53 PM] ONI#6888
Yes you will earn yield on the tokens in the vault


[10/21/2021 10:53 PM] PrinceDragon#3779
That was quick, ty


[10/21/2021 10:54 PM] ONI#6888
It's just they won't show in your wallet when you send them to Abra, but you will see them when you repay your loan

For eth mainnet you cannot use the official unless you have GRT tokens.


[10/21/2021 11:59 PM] guillesalazar#1963
As Dark mentioned. You need GRT tokens to query the ETH mainnet subgraph. It is 1 GRT ~=100k queries iirc.
For fantom you dont need tokens, you can query it using the playground or sending a request (using axios for example)

g'day all. Having an issue; metamask not being identified. I 'connect', it shows me a list of wallets and I choose metamask. It doesn't find it, instead directing me to download it. First time I have experienced this (on other sites it works fine). I've turned off all blockers etc.

I can't withdraw even small amounts from saCRV v2 except in the native token for which there seems to be no swap market. Is that the same reason why I can't withdraw? I thought Aave was a popular platform and the Vault has reasonable liquidity. Any help much appreciated...

I have been directed by Yearn support to use https://yearndapp.finance to resolve a vault withdrawal issue. Is this site a legitimate Yearn site? (The wallet connect for Coinbase asks for private keys!)

No one from Yearn will ever send you a private message. The only legitimate links to Yearn are https://yearn.finance, https://beta.yearn.finance, and https://yearn.fi

I recommend you do this manually instead if it doesnt allow you to do your withdrawal to another token


[10/23/2021 3:06 AM] Blahtum#6949
Can you explain how I do this please?


[10/23/2021 3:08 AM] j.#6352
Just withdraw to the underlying token https://beta.yearn.finance/#/vault/0xb4D1Be44BfF40ad6e506edf43156577a3f8672eC


[10/23/2021 3:09 AM] Blahtum#6949
But there are no markets swap from the underlying token. I cannot find anywhere that will swap from saCRV to any other token.


[10/23/2021 3:14 AM] j.#6352
This is why i suggest you do it manually: withdraw to underlying Curve LP token, withdraw from Curve to the underlying token, then swap to any token you want on any DEX


[10/23/2021 3:15 AM] j.#6352
You can try Zapper.fi or Zerion.io to check if your vault to token route is available


[10/23/2021 3:20 AM] kx9x#3778
https://curve.fi/saave/withdraw


[10/23/2021 3:20 AM] kx9x#3778
this is saCRV, right?


[10/23/2021 3:31 AM] Blahtum#6949
Yes but it comes from Curve sAave
v2 vault so the token I withdraw is yvCurve-sAave not straight sAave so i cannot withdraw from the sAave pool on Curve

[10/23/2021 3:37 AM] j.#6352
yvcrvsAAVE is the vault token. You having this means you have not withdrawn anything


[10/23/2021 3:38 AM] j.#6352
maybe you have only done the approval to spend transaction to allow the contract to take your vault tokens to give you back the underlying crvsaave

[10/23/2021 3:42 AM] Blahtum#6949
Well, I am pretty sure I have withdrawn yvcrvsAAVE because a) I have already approved the transaction, b) Yearn.finance says I have no more holdings in yvcrvsAAVE v2 vault and c) I have the right amount of yvcrvsAAVE tokens in my wallet!


[10/23/2021 3:44 AM] j.#6352
yvcrvsAAVE is the vault token. Note the prefix *yv*

OK, sorry for the wait and thank you for your patience. I think I have resolved it and now have the converted DAI available via your proposed manual route. I think the issue lies with Trust wallet / wallet connect and transaction lags. Thanks again Yearn team!

Hi the Fantom... is the gross week APR annualised? when I look at the share price of the FTM/FTM vault, it does not seem to change at all!
can you please explain?
https://ape.tax/the-fantom
the price per share is virtually unchanged since 2 weeks, which means just zero returns... what happens here?

Correct, your deposit in the crv steth vault allows yearn to earn the CRV rewards for that pool and harvests and compounds your gains 👍

I think the addition of lots of tvl into the vault now at 165m has dropped yields and maxed strategies, but the strategists are making a push this week to add more wftm strategies

What happen, if i deposit cyUSDC on curve (Fantom)? My collateral on Ironbank (USDC) will be reduced after depositing cy-Token?


[10/26/2021 12:01 AM] old_frog_#6669
🤔 yeah i believe because you wont have that collateral on ironbank


[10/26/2021 12:01 AM] old_frog_#6669
won't be able to borrow as much against it @Unknown


[10/26/2021 12:01 AM] 0xrok#8210
Ok thank you


[10/26/2021 12:34 AM] ONI#6888
It wont change what you had in the Ironbank. At IB you put in 1000 usdc (lets say) then you can borrow against that like dai or yfi up to as much as 70% loan to value (ltv) or 700$ worth of YFI. I think your question is if you deposit fantom IB tokens to another DeFi protocol will you still be able to see them in the fantom IB. The answer is no, since you technically no longer have ownership of them they are in curve. But that doesnt mean you cannot withdrawal from curve, your original IB tokens you put in + yield gained, you can. 

If you use native tokens or other protocol tokens in another protocol it wont show up in the original protocol as being in your wallet (because it's not!). Ie if you take ywETH and deposit it to alchemix it will __not__ show up on yearn at beta.yearn.finance.


[10/26/2021 12:44 AM] 0xrok#8210
Thank you very much. My question is if my loan to value decreases if I deposit cyUSDC at curve. Example: I deposit 1000 USDC at Ironbank and borrow 700 Dai for it. Now I deposit a part of the cyUSDC at curve. Now these tokens are no longer in my wallet and my loan to value should then also decrease? 
And what if I deposit all cyUSDC? Then I would have to be liquidated immediately at ironbank....


[10/26/2021 1:09 AM] ONI#6888
Yes it will decrease as its not longer in your wallet, so yes it would liquidate you and charge you I think 8% fee.

If you supply assets in iron bank on ETH , is there a tokenized version of it that you can farm somewhere ? Kind of like on aave when you supply you get aToken that can be put in a liquidity pool


[10/26/2021 2:27 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Gaia, I believe the intention of the Iron Bank is to borrow against your deposit (leverage) rather than creating a tokenized version of your deposit. So you can borrow one of the Iron Bank assets against the loan you have provided, then find a place to provide that as further liquidity. https://docs.yearn.finance/yearn-finance/yvaults/yvault-advantages#leverage has a little info, https://creamdotfinance.medium.com/introducing-the-iron-bank-bab9417c9a for some deeper reading into the Iron Bank.

I've been traveling, moved, got a new cpu and basically sort of forgot about it all....

Now I'm looking and I see that my Deposit Value in that pJar is about 30% less in $$$ amount, than if I had kept it as ETH. 

What gives. Did I do something wrong?

[10/26/2021 8:05 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
If you've been in it for a while you should see rewards come through on withdraw, so no you shouldn't "lose" any pickle. 
If you’d like to claim earned PICKLE 🥒 rewards or withdraw yvBOOST-ETH SLP, please, use the UI at app.pickle.finance/farms.

Hello. Probably a noob question but it would be great if someone can help out. I have already staked my ETH on Lido and I got some sitting stETH now. Not a lot, like 1.3 Eth.

Zapper.fi allows you to invest stETH in Curve StETH vault, but I wonder if I'll get the staking rewards on Lido separately to my wallet if I do this.

Also Yearn's APY is 3.4, which is lower than the 4.9 percent in Lido staking. What does the Yearn APY include? The Staking rewards and rewards from Curve as well?

Can someone let me know a bit more about what is going on? And let me know if it is worth to zap matt StETH into the vault it in my situation.

Thanks


[10/27/2021 11:03 AM] j.#6352
No you will not get staking rewards *separately in your wallet*. Zapper.fi's main thing is to simplify multi-step processes in using DeFi products. For the Curve stETH Yearn vault, coming from only 100% stETH, this means depositing stETH in the stETH pool in Curve, then depositing the resulting liquidity pool tokens in the Yearn vault. Zapper.fi can instead do this for you in one step/action.

Yearn's APY for the Curve stETH vault includes staking rewards but not in the way you might think. The LP tokens of the Curve stETH pool represents a ratio or balance of stETH and ETH. You can check this on Curve's website: https://curve.fi/steth. With composition currently at 42% ETH and 58% stETH, this means you're only really ~58% exposed to stETH. So very roughly, for the sake of example figures, 58% of 4.9% of staking rewards

Hello! I had CRV that I locked into the yveCRV vault. It looks like I have a little of that still, but the majority I put into a yveCRV/ETH LP on sushiswap. Then I did the stuff at pickle, and when yvBOOST came out, I zapped out and back in to that new version of the jar. My question is in regards to claiming an airdrop based on the underlying crv that I own.


[10/27/2021 6:51 PM] old_frog_#6669
Which airdrop are you referring to?


[10/27/2021 6:51 PM] ZrowGz#4358
EPS


[10/27/2021 6:51 PM] old_frog_#6669
That would be claimed independently for yourself on Binance Smart Chain


[10/27/2021 6:54 PM] ZrowGz#4358
It doesn't recognize that I'm eligible since I put the crv in the vault, the vault in the LP pool, the LP in the pickle.finance jar... I was asking over there, and the understanding was that since it goes into the vault, Yearn is the only one that can claim it then...

That EPS was harvested and airdropped into the vault, so the vault value appreciated when they harvested. There is no more EPS for you to claim in this case.

Does the vault still hold the EPS? or was it liquidated

This isn't the issue.  I haven't changed my vote in maybe 7-8 weeks I have been able to claim SPELL every week but this week a new reward for the same pool showed up and now I am only eligible for that.


[10/27/2021 9:33 PM] paulscreen#3942
I 100% haven't changed my vote.  I believe this is an issue caused by there being more than one gauge bribe for the same pool

you can probably call claim reward with 0xd8b712d29381748dB89c36BCa0138d7c75866ddF as gauge and 0x090185f2135308BaD17527004364eBcC2D37e5F6 as reward token

the tokens_for_bribe method returns the correct amount, but not claimable


[10/27/2021 10:12 PM] paulscreen#3942
looks like a bug in the contract.  last_user_claim is not returning the correct timestamp for me (it's giving a time 1 hour ago, but my last claim is just over 7 days ago).  I'm no solidity dev, but it looks like a but in the  _claim_reward function, setting the last_user_claim to the wrong value.


[10/27/2021 10:54 PM] paulscreen#3942
well whatever is the cause, I can see that not a single person has managed to claim any bribe since they unlocked today (whereas at this time every other week there is claim after claim tx in the contract history).  So something is broken.

Once you deposit funds into IronBank and get cy tokens and activate them as collateral but do not borrow - can you farm these tokens somewhere ? Do they continue to accumulate interest if they are taken out of ironbank ?

Hello! I still have yieldfarming.insure SAFE on my wallet. Is there anything else I can do with it? 😢


[10/28/2021 3:27 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Ok so I did a search and got some insights, but not a ton. Am curious about the new YFI vault, I got the "you should migrate" message, but I searched and saw some talks about a router that would just transfer my funds automagically? If so, why have the "you should migrate" message? (I realize I'm like... a month late on this change so apologies if I'm retreading on things) 



Total secondary question, it looks like gasnow.org is gone... but their API is still live? I'm guessing I shouldn't use that? What is the current go-to API for ETH gas prices?


[10/28/2021 3:43 PM] old_frog_#6669
Gasnow deprecated on Oct. 15 :rip:


[10/28/2021 3:43 PM] Waffleophagus#7802

[10/28/2021 4:21 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
does it have an API? I wrote a little tool that pings an API at a certain interval to send me push notifications when gas prices are at a set predefined range, and also tracks history.


[10/28/2021 4:22 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
oops, see "API docs" link on their page

[10/28/2021 4:24 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Ok, following up on the other question... I know what a router is for networking, but I have no idea what it would be in the context of a YFI vault. So the router, what does it do? Is there a writeup anywhere? Just curious. My share of the old YFI is really small fry compared, so having to withdraw/migrate (with current gas prices, hence why I'm tracking gas prices again) would be like 30% of my total investment which feels real bad.


[10/28/2021 4:27 PM] vany#0365
are you in the old yearn v2 vault?


[10/28/2021 4:27 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
I believe V2, but it still suggests I migrate

[10/28/2021 4:29 PM] vany#0365
so the vault code was updated and thats what the migration is for. since gas is so high the old vault has a router strategy that take old vault funds and just deposits them into the new vault for you. This should be around for a while but wont last forever.


[10/28/2021 4:30 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Ok so I have to authorize the migration from the V2 to what I assume is a V3 (or V2.1? whatever, numbers aren't important)


[10/28/2021 4:30 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
and it would be cheaper in theory than withdrawing it and depositing it again


[10/28/2021 4:30 PM] vany#0365
it would save some gas


[10/28/2021 4:30 PM] vany#0365
but if you are taking a 30% hit i would just wait till gas is back at like 20 gwei as the router strategy means you are still earning


[10/28/2021 4:31 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Gotcha. Is there a hard and fast end date on the router? I ask cause right now the migration cost would still be more than the lifetime of my earnings on that vault. I imagine that would change at a different time of day with gas fees.


[10/28/2021 4:31 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
Wanna wait till its a bit cheaper.


[10/28/2021 4:34 PM] kx9x#3778
it is probably well worth waiting for gas to be cheaper over the weekend than paying more now


[10/28/2021 4:34 PM] kx9x#3778
no hard and fast date. I think strategists will keep using the router as long as there is a chonky amount of yfi in the old vault


[10/28/2021 4:35 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
yea, probably update my little tool, I haven't wrapped my head around the new 1559 fee structure either, so do those two things then wait till its cheap and migrate, thanks for the explinations!


[10/28/2021 4:35 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
and the new API


[10/28/2021 4:37 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah just wait until base fee is like 50 or something


[10/28/2021 4:37 PM] kx9x#3778
metamask will quote you based on max fee, which is the max you will pay, but usually you will just end up paying the base (which is normally like half)


[10/28/2021 4:37 PM] kx9x#3778
and then gas estimates tend to be a bit over, so the quoted price might be way way higher than the actual you spend


[10/28/2021 4:38 PM] kx9x#3778
you can always look at the contract tx history and see what people ended up paying


[10/28/2021 4:38 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
so if I wait till base fee is like 50, chances are I'll be paying like 30? neat


[10/28/2021 4:39 PM] kx9x#3778
nah, base fee is the minimum


[10/28/2021 4:39 PM] kx9x#3778
max fee is... well the max


[10/28/2021 4:40 PM] kx9x#3778
so if base fee is 50 and metamask defaults you to a 100 max fee, chances are you will probably pay 50 unless usage spikes up and forces you up to 100


[10/28/2021 4:40 PM] kx9x#3778
you can always lower max fee to be more certain you won't pay much more than you want


[10/28/2021 4:41 PM] kx9x#3778
metamask kinda defaults high on max fee


[10/28/2021 4:41 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
gotcha, the API I'm looking at still has gas, that's just a "I'm paying extra to jump the line" stuff right?


[10/28/2021 4:41 PM] kx9x#3778
max fee is just insurance that if base fee increases, then your TX still can go through instead of getting dropped


[10/28/2021 4:42 PM] kx9x#3778
priority fee is the "pay extra to be first" part

[10/28/2021 4:42 PM] kx9x#3778
like right now if you want a 99% chance to be in the next block, you gotta give a 6 priority fee


[10/28/2021 4:43 PM] Waffleophagus#7802
is that a multiplier? ugh... I'll go google around and get an explainer on the new fee strcuture. I took a bit of a break from worrying about crypto for a few months (more like half a year)

It's a fork


[10/29/2021 1:24 PM] cola#5885
Hello, I withdrew some of my usdc , but it’s been 4 hours and 45 minutes and my transaction is still pending , I reset my meta mask account but it’s still pending


[10/29/2021 1:25 PM] j.#6352
did you change/edit the gas when you sent the transaction?


[10/29/2021 1:25 PM] cola#5885
I also sent 0 with to my address with a  80 000 gas limit and 360 Geri and it’s not working


[10/29/2021 1:26 PM] j.#6352
if it's low enough, it may confirm a bit too slow


[10/29/2021 1:28 PM] cola#5885
nope , and I don’t see it anymore on metamask , I think because I reset my account , I can only see it on etherscan


[10/29/2021 1:28 PM] j.#6352
What was your last transaction?


[10/29/2021 1:32 PM] cola#5885
I tried to cancel my transaction with a new transaction with custom nonce


[10/29/2021 1:32 PM] cola#5885
it’s pending too

[10/29/2021 3:10 PM] old_frog_#6669
have you updated your wallet based on Kx9x recommendation? 

Also unlikely that you can submit the transaction on another computer. you can send your 1st wallet some eth to help fund the wallet if it needs more to process


[10/29/2021 4:30 PM] ZrowGz#4358
Is there a reason that the option to pass the airdrop claims on to the holders of the yveCRV wasn't offered? That seems pretty wild that such a large amount of funds was voted on with only 25 people...

[10/29/2021 4:33 PM] kx9x#3778
because EPS would have blacklisted yearn and we would have gotten 0 EPS?


[10/29/2021 4:33 PM] kx9x#3778
so you wanted a vote between getting money versus getting nothing? :What:

[10/29/2021 4:39 PM] ZrowGz#4358
I'm not sure I see why it'd be blacklisted for allowing people to pass through to their own wallets. EPS does this with other platforms where my veCRV is. When talking with folks at Ellipsis, it sounded like it was fully up to Yearn to determine what to do with the airdrops? Plus banteg is one of the 5 multsig signors for the Ellipsis platform (obviously doesn't mean he manages operations there)... Or if there was the option to claim the airdropped EPS from Yearn directly. Honestly that'd be sweet. Give it time to accumulate a few rounds of airdrops and then claim all at once to preserve gas expense.. I think convex takes 50% of the claimmable amount and adds it similarly to a platform focused stake, like how it currently is directed towards the yvBOOST, just instead if at somepoint, we could then claim that from yvBOOST, with a portion also permanently retained for the contract.

Thank you ser! Haha yeah I know I am extremely behind on this, seeing as how this started many many months ago lol I just noticed that I had claimable CVX and started exploring. It'll take a look. Hell, I'm definitely Yearn aligned! That yveCRV play was my very first DeFi action, followed up by LPing it and then it's been over in pickle ever since 🙂

[10/29/2021 4:47 PM] kx9x#3778
if anything, there is nothing stopping someone to write a proposal and pass it via governance that says EPS will be unstaked and forwarded to yveCRV holds based on a snapshot during airdrop or something


[10/29/2021 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778
it comes with an implementation cost, but you need people to like signal via governance that they want this


[10/29/2021 4:48 PM] kx9x#3778

Word, better claimed and benefitting than left out to expire some day... Yeah, I haven't read through it yet either fully. Just took a look over the link you shared last time. I'll take a look through the channels and see what I can see 🙂 I mean, realistically, it shouldn't make much of a difference I'd think... I plan to basically never sell the yvBOOST I have, so being all tied up in there, it does make sense since the EPS is based upon the number of underlying veCRV I have, that it actually cuts down on gas costs for me to have to deal with the claims and transfers and re-staking. Just really interested to see how the airdropped tokens are being utilized and how the strategy enhances the value of the yvBOOST I hodl  I'll have to look back at the yield strategy for the pool and see how these new tokens have been integrated into that

yvBOOST recently got a bunch of money allocated to it since yearn liquidated a bunch of crv bribes and put that money into yvBOOST


[10/29/2021 4:57 PM] kx9x#3778

Oh that's sick! I didn't even think about that aspect! The fact that all those same functionalities and yields end up funneling right into that single contract, without me needing to stay up on it.... That's wild. Love it! Does it negatively impact my return to have the yvBOOST over in a pickle jar? It seems like I get a little tiny bit of pickle, but not a whole lot of return otherwise... It used to be a sweet apy on there, but I'm not sure what happened.. Probably a lot of money poured in haha

[10/29/2021 5:09 PM] ZrowGz#4358
I like that Yearn isn't dumping the tokens and airdrops. Seems like if the decision to sell was made, it'd be nice if we got then option to claim and withdraw those tokens before sale. I tend to like holding things for a long time since you never know what will run up to a bajillion

your yvboost still benefits, but you have a fluctuating amount of yvboost due to the nature of being an LP

Yeah, I know... Probably wasn't the best idea, but like I said, it was the very first thing I ever did in DeFi, so I didn't really understand IL... now I figure I should just let it ride. If anything, eth has mooned so hard since then that it maybe has yielded me more yvBOOST that I'd of had otherwise... I'm pretty sure I got nearly 2x the CVX tokens than the number of CRV I had originally purchased and locked up. There was a small number of straggler yvecrv that sat in my wallet and have definitely grown over time

[11/02/2021 1:39 AM] FoxTheSin#9247
yTrade wasn't really launched publicly and is more of an idea. And the general principal behind leverage trading is: Bob gives yTrade 1 USDT. Bob gets 1000 DAI, but only through yTrade account (not Bob's wallet.) If bob's yTrade account loses close to the amount of collateral Bob gave, Bob gets liquidated. it's a way to maximize arbitrage situations. Hope this makes sense!

3crv tokens are claimed for you then unwrapped to get the underlying stablecoins to get you more yveCRV, the underlying token of yvBOOST

I vested my kp3r 12 days ago. My rewards aren't showing. Is that because I didn't vote? I would really prefer not to since the gass fees. Do do my rewards still accumulate even if I can't see them?

Hey Gaia, check this doc for mechanics of Iron Bank (https://docs.cream.finance/iron-bank/interest-rate-model) 
Since Iron Bank is a cream product, most info I think would stay in the #cream channel. Cream is responsible for the Iron Bank as it is their product, Yearn has helped them out and we utilize it in some of our strategies. 
As for the short term vision regarding the exploit, the Yearn war room went to work and aided the cream team out, thankfully all of the Yearn funds were safe from the attack. Here are two good posts about the attack (initial https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1453393444047441923 and post mortem https://mudit.blog/cream-hack-analysis/ ) Crypto has it's dangers as we continue to see with many protocols being hacked. Yearn devs and strategists do an amazing job of reviewing and auditing contracts and protocols prior to launch and will continue to assist the community as best as we can.

hi, i've been playing around with defi for the first time and i've supplied some usdc to the iron bank. there is a slider that reads "collateral" that i was unable to find any information on. can anyone tell me what that does and whether i need to have it on or not? thanks!


[11/03/2021 4:36 AM] j.#6352
If you turn it on, you'll be able to borrow other tokens.


[11/03/2021 4:36 AM] qumatru[42k by May]#0765
well i clicked it and it seems that, if i understand it correctly, it allows me to borrow against my own deposit?


[11/03/2021 4:37 AM] j.#6352
if you only want to lend, there's no need to turn it on


[11/03/2021 4:37 AM] j.#6352
Yes

about 2%


[11/04/2021 1:16 PM] scooby#8379
Thanks what about depositing USDC into the vault? Or would the APY be higher if we supply USDC to Iron Bank?


[11/04/2021 1:19 PM] j.#6352
I just checked. USDC Fantom vault is about 20% before fees


[11/04/2021 1:23 PM] scooby#8379
Thanks J, I wonder for Fantom chain, which protocols have the highest APY for USDC deposit. I note in Tarot, the USDC APY for single side supply in the Spooky USDC/FTM pool is now showing 26%.

hi, hope you're well. Whats the most cost effective way to withdraw USDC from the Curve 3Crypto pool on Yearn. Withdrawal + zap to USDC seems to cost roughly $500 at 180 gwei prices. Withdrawing would cost roughly $90, but then you're obviously left with Curve 3Crypto. Would that trade through 3Curve also cost roughly $400?


[11/04/2021 2:08 PM] j.#6352
The way i understand it is that you're not really saving that much on gas costs by zapping. You're saving on time. The steps involved are just done in one transaction so you only have to do one thing. 
You can stagger the withdrawals over time to reduce the mental pain of having to deal with L1 ETH gas but you'll eventually still get to the same result.


[11/04/2021 2:08 PM] j.#6352
I personally would wait for ~100 gwei before zapping out


[11/04/2021 2:09 PM] j.#6352
If you need the money soon, you'll zap out anyway


[11/04/2021 2:57 PM] niels#3006

Hello guys!

Can someone please explain me why my WFTM does not show up in the vault? I used beta.yearn.finance and approved the transaction 2 times - Pretty sure and I saw it too in FTMSCAN.

Zapper shows me the correct amount in my vault.

Any Ideas?


[11/05/2021 7:56 AM] sinho#0404
I did also a second deposit in my vault with a little and this amount shows up now but not the first transaction.

I had a hypothetical question


[11/05/2021 3:47 PM] MarkZuckerburg#9743
is the eth gas fee going to be the same for zapping in or out of a vault no matter the amount of capital going in?


[11/05/2021 3:47 PM] MarkZuckerburg#9743
for example, would depositing/withdrawing $100 into a yearn vault cost the same amount of gas fees at $100,000?


[11/05/2021 3:48 PM] MarkZuckerburg#9743
hopefully I'm in the right channel for this


[11/05/2021 3:49 PM] arberx#3367
Yes, it depends on the vault and if a strat needs to have funds pulled from it to complete the withdrawal


[11/05/2021 3:49 PM] arberx#3367
In general, no it shouldn't matter

When providing collateral in Iron Bank do you earn interest on the collateral when you uses it to take out a loan?


[11/05/2021 10:36 PM] FoxTheSin#9247

Or even try a hard refresh of the webpage.


[11/05/2021 10:48 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Yes, there is a lend (supply) APY. And when you take out a loan it also has it's own APY.


[11/05/2021 10:58 PM] FoxTheSin#9247

@J • yHelper Thanks, i think i read that, that's why i decided to put in some. Tho I read "Receive yveCRV or yvBOOST tokens for your deposited CRV, allowing you to easily extract profit or exit your staked CRV position". I do not understand, because when i withdraw i see this

[11/06/2021 1:13 PM] CheeseMaker#3398
Not sure why there seems to be an amount that cannot be withdrawn.. as you see descrepancies among $ values


[11/06/2021 1:15 PM] DerpeeDog#6148
Are the earned vault rewards on Fantom for WFTM accurate at this time?


[11/06/2021 1:15 PM] j.#6352
Ah. dont rely on USD values for these two tokens/vaults. Also, why are you withdrawing to yveCRV? yvBOOST already autocompounds yveCRV rewards for you


[11/06/2021 1:15 PM] j.#6352
Yes


[11/06/2021 1:16 PM] DerpeeDog#6148
Okay thanks


[11/06/2021 1:49 PM] CheeseMaker#3398
I see that I can withdraw in other currencies. But still i do not get why the amount will be always lower, eg with USD of the max 930ish i would get around 100 less, 830ish therefore. My intention is to be in, but would i be able to withdraw all that amount as shown in the lab when I would need??


[11/06/2021 1:49 PM] CheeseMaker#3398
And, what do you mean by "dont rely on USD values for these two tokens/vaults"?


[11/06/2021 1:50 PM] j.#6352
yvBOOST and yveCRV are tradeable on Sushiswap. These are the only markets for these two vault tokens. I recommend you watch the analytics site of Sushiswap for these two


[11/06/2021 2:02 PM] CheeseMaker#3398
Yes. So I suppose those transactions would be executed through Sushiswap, and so the price of the yve token would be dependent on the demand/offer balance and exchange fees. But i just checked for ETH now and, getting 0,190 ETH from 444.238 yveBOOST, while for Sushi conversion rate I should get 194. Is that difference coming from where exactly?


[11/06/2021 2:13 PM] j.#6352
.194? slippage then


[11/06/2021 2:13 PM] j.#6352
i just tried it myself. im shown 0.224 ETH for 444.238 yvBOOST


[11/06/2021 2:15 PM] CheeseMaker#3398
I see. I think you sorted out my doubts then. Perhaps if there would be room for a last question would be your personal opinion of this tool with future perspective..?!!


[11/06/2021 2:17 PM] j.#6352
Which tool? yvBOOST vault? Hmm I'd stay in yvBOOST for the compounding returns, but i'd move to ETH for potential upside


[11/06/2021 2:18 PM] j.#6352
so it could be either, depending on your current portfolio/stack/tokens


[11/06/2021 2:18 PM] j.#6352
not financial advice™️


[11/06/2021 2:18 PM] CheeseMaker#3398
yes yveBOOST... thx 🙂

Thank you.

How could I establish an approximate APR for that strategy? I see there's one for MiM too.


[11/06/2021 3:39 PM] MarkZuckerburg#9743

[11/06/2021 3:42 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Oh that's incredible. I was unaware! In case of multiple strategies, do the APRs portrayed in the reports combine?


[11/06/2021 3:43 PM] j.#6352
that was a reply to Brucey


[11/06/2021 3:43 PM] j.#6352
Yes. but you'll have to consider the weighting/distribution of vault funds to each strategy if there are more than one


[11/06/2021 3:44 PM] MarkZuckerburg#9743
Oh ok


[11/06/2021 3:44 PM] MarkZuckerburg#9743
So theres no way to check APY on FTM faults yet?


[11/06/2021 3:46 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
I see, that makes sense. Are the APRs reported before or after the Yearn mgmt and performance fees?


[11/06/2021 3:46 PM] j.#6352
See the solution i described above to Brucey


[11/06/2021 3:46 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Looks like 15-20% on the USDC vault and 20-30% on MiM, atm.


[11/06/2021 3:46 PM] j.#6352
These are before fees


[11/06/2021 3:47 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913

yup


[11/06/2021 3:47 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Am I correct in reading the wFTM APR is around 5-7,5% atm?


[11/06/2021 3:47 PM] j.#6352
eventually these Fantom vaults may be added to yearn.vision too for more data to geek out on


[11/06/2021 3:47 PM] j.#6352
i think my last guess was about 2%


[11/06/2021 3:47 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913
Snap.


[11/06/2021 3:48 PM] Brucey0x | Deus Ex DAO#7913

I know YieldYak does about 4x on TraderJoe's compound fork


[11/06/2021 3:49 PM] j.#6352
Nope. not personally. i think these are still done manually currently. so it's up to strategists. but last i heard, harvests are done daily for Fantom vaults, but also looking at that link above, i see it has ramped up to twice a day now if im reading it correctly


[11/06/2021 8:02 PM] NFTLoverBoy#7040
the beta dashboard is saying that i have $0.00 in net worth but i deposited wFTM and got back yvwFTM

Hi guys. I am new here and I have two questions regarding the stETH pool in which I staked my money 20 days ago. First of all, the stated APY is 3.48%, but my LP token grows at a speed of only 0.37% so far, which made me wondering what causes this discrepancy? Secondly, do we also enjoy the staking reward of ETH 2.0 at the same time? How is it going to be reflected if we do?


[11/07/2021 2:33 AM] ONI#6888
I doesnt harvest every day that is an average over a week. You can seem more info for harvest on yearn.watch. click on steth vault and click on the strategy with the highest allocation, you can see the apr and when it was harvested. This is before fees btw. 
Also yes stETH does earn staking fees but since you only are holding half stETH and half eth, only have of your funds are earning eth 2.0 staking fees

not sure if this is the right place to ask but I tried to claim my rKP3R https://fixedforex.fi/options here and the tx failed. I checked the contract address and it seems to be happening frequently.

is there anything I can do to make sure I don't waste gas again?


[11/07/2021 1:34 PM] martenJ#0334

@kx9x


[11/07/2021 2:59 PM] kx9x#3778
Hmm I tried running a claim from an account with a failed tx using eth-brownie put ran into an unrelated issue.


[11/07/2021 2:59 PM] kx9x#3778
I wanted to see how much gas to use


[11/07/2021 3:00 PM] kx9x#3778
because all those errors are out of gas,metamask probably isn't estimated gas limit correctly in all claim calls


[11/07/2021 3:05 PM] martenJ#0334
so I just increase the gaslimit and the tx will be successful?


[11/07/2021 3:05 PM] martenJ#0334
sorry I really don't know much about this


[11/07/2021 3:18 PM] kx9x#3778
I am trying to figure out by how much


[11/07/2021 3:18 PM] kx9x#3778
gas limit is just the maximum gas amount you are willing to use


[11/07/2021 3:18 PM] kx9x#3778
gas price is the price per unit gas


[11/07/2021 3:19 PM] kx9x#3778
so if you don't have enough gas limit, the EVM will fail your TX


[11/07/2021 3:22 PM] martenJ#0334
yep, I understand that much


[11/07/2021 3:22 PM] martenJ#0334
just never had to manually adjust gaslimit before


[11/07/2021 3:24 PM] martenJ#0334
also it is not really a claim, if the tx is successful you can just buy KP3R with 50% discount and your rKP3R are gone


[11/07/2021 3:28 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, I think you'd be safe using like 50% more gas limit than metamask suggests, but I wanted to test on a fork to be sure


[11/07/2021 3:28 PM] kx9x#3778
but brownie is not wanting to compile this contract due to a bug :REE:


[11/07/2021 3:29 PM] kx9x#3778
oh hmm, I was able to compile it by just copy pasting it locally instead of relying on brownie's autofetch


[11/07/2021 3:30 PM] kx9x#3778
if you are comfortable, you can DM your address and I can run claim in a dev fork and see how much gas is used


[11/07/2021 3:30 PM] kx9x#3778
if not, then I will just pick the last person who failed this claim


[11/07/2021 3:30 PM] kx9x#3778
and try as them


[11/07/2021 3:30 PM] martenJ#0334

if you have yvWFTM, you get WFTM back by withdrawing. if you want to unwrap wftm to ftm, then go to any exchange like spooky or spirit and just trade wftm to ftm

oh yes I did! I thought I would still see the amount of FTM deposited but this makes sense as that is dictated by yvwFTM in my wallet. Makes sense now, when i switch my MIM back to yvwFTM im guessing the amount will show in yearn vault?

when you repay your MIM debt, that is when you will get your yvWFTM collateral back

whoops I get what you're saying switch wasn't the correct term to use.

and a general question about yvWFTM or any yvtoken do i get the interest made which i repay the debt?


[11/08/2021 1:08 AM] kx9x#3778
the value of yvWFTM in terms of FTM goes up over time. Your debt grows at an interest rate


[11/08/2021 1:08 AM] kx9x#3778
you still get the interest from the yvWFTM when borrowing against it


[11/08/2021 1:09 AM] kx9x#3778
you have to repay the debt back in MIM

Hi, sorry if this is a dumb question. I am looking to withdraw USDN to my metamask so that I can deposit into the Curve USDN vault. Do I have to use the ERC20 network to withdraw it? Or can I use the BEP20 one that is cheaper? If I can use the BEP20 one do I need to add a different token on metamask or will the one I have added pick it up? And will I be able to use yearn vault with the BEP20 USDN? Sorry I am new to all these different formats of the token and would appreciate the help!
Thanks in advance

Are the fees normally that high?


[11/08/2021 6:58 AM] j.#6352
From your screenshot, it looks like this is coming from an exchange. So this is up to them. Ethereum gas has been consistently expensive, but an ERC20 transfer does not cost as much as US$71

Hi guys pardon.
I joined a month ago, with wftm to yvwftm on Fantom blockchain.

When I joined, I went on ape tax to see the relationship between Fantom and yvwftm. It was 1:1.8549

After a month I now find myself with a relationship of 1:1.8553

It’s a very slow growth, do we know if this is correct or not working properly?


[11/08/2021 7:40 AM] j.#6352
Yes it is


[11/08/2021 11:19 AM] andy0000#6520
how "safe" is the iron bank? what does it do under the hood? does it just keep the coins there ready to be borrowed?


[11/08/2021 11:48 AM] defiglenn#3350
So iron bank is protocol to protocol, like Yearn lending to Cream or vice versa, so I think that means less chance of a bad actor since only recognised protocols would use Iron bank


[11/08/2021 12:10 PM] andy0000#6520
but i can still borrow or lend. me as an external actor... no?


[11/08/2021 1:51 PM] defiglenn#3350
Not entirely sure. Was reading from here: https://creamdotfinance.medium.com/introducing-the-iron-bank-bab9417c9a

maybe @j. can shed some lights here pls?


[11/08/2021 2:04 PM] j.#6352
You should be able to use Iron Bank in https://beta.yearn.finance/ironbank


[11/08/2021 2:11 PM] andy0000#6520
got that, just wandering what it does under the hood and why it is considered safer than vaults @j.


[11/08/2021 2:11 PM] andy0000#6520
maybe wrong channel?


[11/08/2021 2:14 PM] j.#6352
They are different and separate products. Vaults allow you to earn yield to get more of your principal token. Iron Bank is lending and borrowing.


[11/08/2021 2:15 PM] andy0000#6520
but that's also true for lending. i still get more of my principal token no?


[11/08/2021 2:15 PM] j.#6352
yup


[11/08/2021 2:15 PM] andy0000#6520
let's say i wanna make yield on USDC. why would I choose vaults vs iron bank? i guess that's what it comes down to


[11/08/2021 2:16 PM] j.#6352
but if there are lots of borrows, and youre left with not enough liquidity, you might not be able to withdraw when you want to


[11/08/2021 2:16 PM] j.#6352
👆


[11/08/2021 2:18 PM] andy0000#6520
ahhh wasn't taking that into account... so there is a chance that the token you put in stays just locked forever?


[11/08/2021 2:23 PM] j.#6352
Im not sure. not sure what happens if a borrower chooses to never pay. i dont know much about it


[11/08/2021 2:29 PM] andy0000#6520

[11/08/2021 2:40 PM] j.#6352
We dont keep a list or repository of these as anyone can create a platform that does this. Aside from Abracadabra, try Unit Protocol

wait for lower gas or cheaper eth


[11/09/2021 5:19 PM] jamesmagoo#9462
The migration transaction is gas intensive, can Yearn let me withdraw?


[11/09/2021 5:22 PM] jamesmagoo#9462
I think my question is - is there any plans to allow withdrawals on layer 2 so we an get our money out without losing the majority of it on fees?


[11/09/2021 6:03 PM] kx9x#3778
yas, you can withdraw instead of migrating

Hey there - I've been in the DeFi space a few months, and had a weird thing happen a little awhile ago... I Sushi swapped for some yveCRV, and then went to approve the deposit via the yearn then ledger/metamask - I didnt get yvBOOST tokens


[11/09/2021 8:12 PM] arberx#3367
Two transactions


[11/09/2021 8:12 PM] arberx#3367
One to actually do the swap


[11/09/2021 8:12 PM] Mikey O#2005
yeah - I swapped first... got them in my wallet


[11/09/2021 8:12 PM] arberx#3367

[11/09/2021 8:13 PM] Mikey O#2005

[11/09/2021 8:50 PM] Mikey O#2005

Awesome.  Thank you!!


[11/10/2021 5:36 AM] Shin#8846
Sorry for the noob question but... what's the point in harvesting pickle tokens after staking in the yvBOOST-ETH lp? A normal transaction to harvest costs around 75 € in gas fees while pickle seem to stack up very slowly... what am I missing here?


[11/10/2021 5:38 AM] j.#6352
If it's not worth the gas harvesting PICKLE rewards, then it's not worth the gas. If it is, it is. That's it


[11/10/2021 6:12 AM] Shin#8846
Thanks! Say that I wanted to unstake from the jar and swap with a stable coin but on binance chain instead of eth, what would be the best way to go about it while keeping the transaction fees as low as possible?


[11/10/2021 6:46 AM] j.#6352
Unstake, then zap out to your desired stablecoin, then bridge to BSC. Three steps minimum


[11/10/2021 7:03 AM] jamesmagoo#9462

Is it normal that i don't see my WFTM in yearn finance now? Maybe is a stupid question but iam still need to the defi. Thanks for everyone

Can't believe a protocol would put their LPs in so much risk. The protocol is now undercollateralized by 65%, LPs took a hit, the $48mm position can't be unwrapped (its currently -$10mm). If everything goes uponly (cvx+mochi+liquidity) it works out, but such risk for users. https://t.co/4Uyvxtwhsi

This is amazingly scammy;

1. Be Mochi
2. Incentivize USDM/3pool
3. Get $100mm liquidity
4. Mint free Mochi
5. Use Mochi to mint 46mm USDM
6. Swap USDM to DAI
7. Buy 46mm worth of CVX 
8. Use CVX to vote more incentives
9. Liquidity increases more
10. Repeat ad infinitum https://t.co/SU1NwKDOmm

you cannot withdraw to stable from yearn without huge slippage and a simulation failure. if you want, you can withdraw your curve LP and then use curve UI to withdraw stables

[11/11/2021 12:57 PM] Optimalsauce#7602
The price of the yearn strategy token is only going up by the 6k going in, not the whole 24k.  So my Apr for each harvest is like 20% of what is listed.  When will I start seeing the full value of being in the pool


[11/11/2021 1:05 PM] j.#6352

The APR will be calculated based on the actual return of the vault, not the net profit. As long as your funds are in the pool, you earn the APR based on your time in pool, harvest schedule, etc. So you are seeing the full value of being in the pool.
Net profit is how much the strategy was able to return in that particular harvest. So some of profit will come back to the vault, some gets reinvested to continue earning greater rewards, and some ends up in the treasury.

My USDM tokens in yearn contract. Why I can’t withdraw them? It shows 0 balance, but I have tokens there


[11/11/2021 1:43 PM] 0xAction#7645
Can u pls help me with that issue? What you mean by withdrawn curve lp?


[11/11/2021 1:44 PM] j.#6352
Withdraw *Curve USDM* or *crvUSDM*, whichever is shown, not another token


[11/11/2021 1:44 PM] kx9x#3778
the vault holds your curve LP token, you can withdraw that. It is called Curve USDM


[11/11/2021 1:45 PM] j.#6352
what kx said


[11/11/2021 1:45 PM] kx9x#3778
if it shows 0 balance however, then are you sure you actually have a balance?


[11/11/2021 1:45 PM] kx9x#3778
sometimes users will put their tokens elsewhere or withdraw and conveniently forget.


[11/11/2021 1:45 PM] 0xAction#7645
Yes


[11/11/2021 1:45 PM] kx9x#3778

I’m sorry I guess I’m not understanding.  I put into the vault when the share price was 1.00, now it’s 1.004765.  So only 0.4765% gain in 12 days, which is about 14.4% APR.  If I withdraw now, that’s all I receive.  I feel like it should be at least double that


[11/11/2021 4:22 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
check out yearnwatch (https://yearn.watch/network/ethereum/vault/0xd8C620991b8E626C099eAaB29B1E3eEa279763bb/strategy/0x5796698A29F3626c9FE13C4d3d3dEE987c84EBB3)
under reports tab, click on a transaction, then hover over the APR (?) and it'll show you how it calculates. That might help give you an idea for how Yearn calculates APR.

Hi I have a deposit that’s stuck in the deprecated usdc v2 vault, when I try to withdraw, it’s says it’s going to cost an obscene amount (not in gas), why is this please, and is there a way around it?


[11/11/2021 8:57 PM] ganchu1987#3659
@kx9x @arberx


[11/11/2021 9:11 PM] kx9x#3778
cost an obscene amount, but not gas? what do you mean


[11/11/2021 9:12 PM] kx9x#3778
screenshot might clear some stuff up


[11/11/2021 9:12 PM] kx9x#3778
whether it is an error, or just a high gas cost (which with high eth price and high gwei right now, would make sense)


[11/11/2021 9:15 PM] ganchu1987#3659
Trying to dm you @kx9x sent you a friend request


[11/11/2021 9:17 PM] ganchu1987#3659
To clarify above, cost to migrate* not withdraw


[11/11/2021 9:17 PM] kx9x#3778
did you approve the migration contract?

[11/11/2021 9:37 PM] i90#2704
I'm trying to unstake my Governance V2 YFI but I got an error that the gas fee was more than I had. How do I adjust?


[11/11/2021 9:38 PM] i90#2704
max fee per gas less than block base fee...


[11/11/2021 9:46 PM] kx9x#3778
yearn.finance will show a migration UI


[11/11/2021 9:47 PM] kx9x#3778
you can adjust max fee but you will have to wait for base gas prices to drop for it to ever hit


[11/11/2021 9:52 PM] i90#2704
Thank you. How do I adjust on the interface? I just see an Unstake tokens button and a minimal UI


[11/11/2021 9:52 PM] kx9x#3778
max gas fee is determined by your wallet software, not by any website interface


[11/11/2021 9:53 PM] kx9x#3778
if you use metamask, there is an edit button where you can adjust max fee for gas


[11/11/2021 9:53 PM] i90#2704
ok thank you


[11/11/2021 9:58 PM] Kowski#8771
USDC v2 migration costs over 4eth in gas fees. Is that correct? 

Thw USDC vault has a deposit limit of 500k - does that mean that we don't need to migrate right away?

Thanks


[11/11/2021 10:01 PM] kx9x#3778
usdc v2 vault is still integrated in a lot of things, so you can hang tight


[11/11/2021 10:01 PM] kx9x#3778
it will still be yielding


[11/11/2021 10:01 PM] kx9x#3778

[11/11/2021 10:02 PM] Kowski#8771
Thanks for responding so quickly @kx9x !


[11/11/2021 10:04 PM] kx9x#3778
I am guessing the reason why the gas fee shows so high is because of error because the vault is full


[11/11/2021 10:04 PM] kx9x#3778
we probably shouldn't be telling users to migrate just yet so I'll ping some folks internally since it is confusing


[11/11/2021 10:07 PM] Kowski#8771
I guess I was edgy because i am new to Yearn vaults. It would be helpful not to ping the users. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from what you shared also with other users so it has been rewarding for me


[11/11/2021 10:23 PM] tnrg#9669
Ah. That's a relief. I saw 2.8 ETH cost to migrate as well.


[11/11/2021 10:25 PM] kx9x#3778

[11/11/2021 11:33 PM] Kowski#8771
Does this mean that fees wont be 2-4eth once this is done?


[11/11/2021 11:37 PM] kx9x#3778
Correct

hi I have a relatively newb question - if I deposit Curve MIM into the YFI vault... does Yearn under the covers access the underlying collateral (e.g. MIM, USDT, wBTC and wETH) to then deploy to generate yield?


[11/12/2021 11:59 AM] j.#6352
No. Depositing Curve MIM into the YFI vault would mean unwrapping/withdrawing from Curve to then swap/buy YFI to then actually deposit in the YFI vault. Did you mean the Curve MIM vault?


[11/12/2021 12:03 PM] HoCo#8880
Yes apologies I meant depositing into the Curve MIM vault


[11/12/2021 12:04 PM] j.#6352
Ah then no. That would mean earning yield on those individual tokens with extra steps and gas. Not efficient


[11/12/2021 12:05 PM] j.#6352
Currently the Curve MIM strategy is using Convex. You can see it here https://yearn.watch/network/ethereum/vault/0x2DfB14E32e2F8156ec15a2c21c3A6c053af52Be8


[11/12/2021 12:06 PM] HoCo#8880
ah okay thank you- this is why I got so confused, because I look at Compound and aave and I don't see any markets for CurveMIM so I was wondering where is this yield coming from???

How much should i set as the gas lmite to migrate USDC vault?  metamask quotes an insane high gas limit


[11/13/2021 9:17 AM] firefox#1201
normally a withhraw i've seen uses 100-200k gas, but want to confirm


[11/13/2021 9:26 AM] j.#6352
Metamask almost always over overestimates, probably for safety. I usually just go with whatever is shown. It doesnt use up all the gas anyway


[11/13/2021 9:36 AM] firefox#1201
problem is, it's asking for more than what I got in my wallet, the problem of being a pleb😆


[11/13/2021 9:37 AM] firefox#1201
It's quoting $1400


[11/13/2021 9:37 AM] j.#6352

currently costs over $400 to withdraw from curve sETH vault? Is this possible or am I doing something wrong?


[11/14/2021 1:25 PM] viriditas333#3855
I can't withdraw from the sUSD vault


[11/14/2021 1:25 PM] viriditas333#3855
giving unrealistic ETH fees (8 ETH)

and this isnt just on beta.yearn.finance , yearn.finance doesnt work either


[11/14/2021 2:23 PM] hellohallo#9792
is anyone else seeing super high gas fees for migrating to the new USDC vault?


[11/14/2021 2:24 PM] hellohallo#9792
after the initial approval


[11/14/2021 2:24 PM] hellohallo#9792
its asking for a 0.25 eth gas fee


[11/14/2021 2:28 PM] hellohallo#9792
I'm also getting ridic quote to migrate to new usdc vault and I have plenty of ETH in the wallet....


[11/14/2021 3:06 PM] thetechnocratic#3867
yeah its because the call will fail


[11/14/2021 3:06 PM] thetechnocratic#3867
if you try it on beta.yearn.finance, the simulation fails


[11/14/2021 3:07 PM] thetechnocratic#3867
i see token is set to 0x0 address in the yusdc 0.3.0 vault, wondering if that has something to do w/ it


[11/14/2021 3:07 PM] kx9x#3778
it is probably full


[11/14/2021 3:07 PM] kx9x#3778
nvm it isn't


[11/14/2021 3:08 PM] thetechnocratic#3867
@kx9x i think the problem is in withdrawing from the old vault, since that isnt working either


[11/14/2021 3:09 PM] kx9x#3778
hmm only 27 usdc idle in the old vault


[11/14/2021 3:09 PM] kx9x#3778
means you gotta pull from the strategies


[11/14/2021 3:09 PM] kx9x#3778
that might be failing


[11/14/2021 3:10 PM] thetechnocratic#3867
when can you guys harvest and leave something in the buffer?


[11/14/2021 3:17 PM] kx9x#3778

not sure why etherscan shows 0x0000000000


[11/14/2021 3:28 PM] kx9x#3778
I am asking internally


[11/14/2021 3:29 PM] kx9x#3778
apparently that is an etherscan issue with vyper, not something to worry about


[11/14/2021 3:31 PM] thetechnocratic#3867
Interesting ok. So then why are withdraws failing? Is the gas required just so high because of needing to pull from the strats?


[11/14/2021 3:32 PM] tj_r#4071
Does anyone know why the USDC vault has 0 APY?


[11/14/2021 3:38 PM] kx9x#3778

How soft migrations work in Yearn

You might've seen DS posting about yvUSDC earning 0% APY. This is not true. The capital didn't flee it either.

The confusion stems from how soft migrations work. We've recently upgraded yvUSDC vault to take advantage of the latest codebase.

you can still withdraw through yearn.fi or through etherscan directly

yearn.fi doesn't use simulations afaik

[11/14/2021 4:08 PM] kx9x#3778
this migration was about $102 with 90 gwei base fee


[11/14/2021 4:08 PM] kx9x#3778
base fee is about 111 right now


[11/14/2021 4:08 PM] kx9x#3778
you have to click the leverage button in the UI


[11/14/2021 4:08 PM] hellohallo#9792
okay, thanks. before I was getting estimated gas of ~$1,100 lol


[11/14/2021 4:09 PM] hellohallo#9792
.2-.25 eth (!!)


[11/14/2021 4:10 PM] tj_r#4071
Is there anywhere else we can leverage our yvUSDC the pool on abacadbra is now deprecated


[11/14/2021 4:14 PM] kx9x#3778
I guess you just have to wait for abra to add the new yvUSDC to a cauldron


[11/14/2021 4:14 PM] kx9x#3778
not sure if I have heard plans


[11/14/2021 4:14 PM] kx9x#3778
for the one I linked, they used 50% of the gas limit and max fee was 160, so they were probably quoted $400 but only paid $102


[11/14/2021 4:14 PM] kx9x#3778
such is life with max fee and gas limit


[11/14/2021 4:30 PM] sevan#9920
Hello I have investment in Curve stETH pool. If I choose ETH from SHOW and withdraw, will ETH go directly to metamask?

Thanks for the additional details. I'll try later tonight when gas is usually lower and will report back


[11/14/2021 4:49 PM] hellohallo#9792
tempted to wait until joinwido launches gasless migrations though


[11/14/2021 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
Yep, either you get eth or weth, don't remember exactly which


[11/14/2021 4:49 PM] hellohallo#9792
do you know why Yearn doesnt just auto-migrate all the positions? why make it user-dependent?


[11/14/2021 4:49 PM] kx9x#3778
But it will go to your wallet, yep


[11/14/2021 4:50 PM] kx9x#3778
!! I don't think we can do that! That means we have complete control over your funds


[11/14/2021 4:50 PM] hellohallo#9792
ah i see, that makes sense.


[11/14/2021 4:50 PM] kx9x#3778
We cannot just move your tokens without approval


[11/14/2021 4:51 PM] hellohallo#9792
i wish there was a way to approve, then yearn batch migrates multiple transactions to save on fees ala wido


[11/14/2021 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
However, we can use a router strategy to route the used to the new vault


[11/14/2021 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
So the old vault still yields but


[11/14/2021 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
We cannot guarantee that we can route everything


[11/14/2021 4:51 PM] kx9x#3778
So might be lower yield, harvested less frequently, etc


[11/14/2021 4:52 PM] kx9x#3778
I just wish eth didn't cost so much tbh lol


[11/14/2021 4:52 PM] hellohallo#9792
yeah I read the details that banteg posted about the old funds being routed to the new vaults so to earn yield during migration process. Eventually--what happens to funds that are not migrated?


[11/14/2021 4:52 PM] hellohallo#9792
will there be a deadline for migrations?


[11/14/2021 4:52 PM] kx9x#3778
I had needing to design around transactions costing so much


[11/14/2021 4:52 PM] kx9x#3778
No deadline. Just at some point the yield will stop but with how much money there is, I doubt that will be any time soon


[11/14/2021 4:53 PM] kx9x#3778
Migrating that much will take a long ass time


[11/14/2021 4:53 PM] hellohallo#9792
okay, thanks so much for the details and clarity @kx9x


[11/14/2021 4:53 PM] kx9x#3778
At worst, the yield stops. The funds will always be there for withdrawal and migration

To anyone who also needs to migrate to the updated USDC Vault: in the announcements, reference was made to Wido's service, which can reduce gas costs significantly. The more users join, the cheaper it will be for everyone!

Hi. I tried to migrate from USDC vault and gas fees are 1000 gwei


[11/14/2021 6:40 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
while network suggested gas is ~120


[11/14/2021 6:40 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
Is there something wrong with the contract?

[11/14/2021 6:51 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
The migration probably is triggering a unwind from the main strategy that implies a flash loan


[11/14/2021 6:51 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
That’s very gas intensive


[11/14/2021 6:58 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
don't understan the terms. do you mean u are under attack?


[11/14/2021 6:59 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
No, that it means that there aren’t funds in the vault to cover your migration and the USDC need to be extracted from a strategy


[11/14/2021 6:59 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
That’s very costly


[11/14/2021 6:59 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
so my funds are locked because u migrated the contract or else I gotta pay 1~2k in fees?


[11/14/2021 7:03 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
is there any way for this to be resolved?


[11/14/2021 7:06 PM] hellohallo#9792
did you just try? @kx9x said earlier that this issue should be resolved. Still high gas fees, but not this high...


[11/14/2021 7:07 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
yes just now


[11/14/2021 7:07 PM] hellohallo#9792
I am waiting till later tonight (in usa central time) to make an attempt. My earlier attempt at migration also triggered a crazy high gas fee similar to yours


[11/14/2021 7:07 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
even withrdaw


[11/14/2021 7:07 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
ok so it's a known issue


[11/14/2021 7:07 PM] hellohallo#9792
you can also wait till later this week when joinwido.com launches their gasless migration feature


[11/14/2021 7:09 PM] kx9x#3778
no, no no


[11/14/2021 7:09 PM] kx9x#3778
no attack


[11/14/2021 7:09 PM] kx9x#3778
metamask will overquote the price quite a bit because transactions don't use 100% of the gas limit


[11/14/2021 7:09 PM] kx9x#3778
and also transactions won't usually hit the max fee (they usually hit the base fee instead)


[11/14/2021 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
so someone who gets quoted $400 might pay $100 if the used half the gas limit and half the max fee


[11/14/2021 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
Richard's point is that right now you migration is going to also be the most gas intensive it could be


[11/14/2021 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
because there isn't idle USDC in the vault, all of it is being used for yielding


[11/14/2021 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
so to take it out of the yielding contracts (the strategies) costs a bit more


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
Ok. Thank you for the details. What do I need to do to migrate without paying 2k?


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] kx9x#3778
so the most optimal way to migrate would be either using wido's gasless migration feature coming in a week


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
is there any resolution


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
ok


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
so wait


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] kx9x#3778
or just wait for gas to be a little cheaper and also wait until a big deposit into the usdc vault


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] kx9x#3778
but since it is the old vault, probably no deposits will come in


[11/14/2021 7:11 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
What is wido's gasless migration?


[11/14/2021 7:12 PM] kx9x#3778
so gonna always be a big expensive


[11/14/2021 7:12 PM] Petros G. (T, T)#0881
and how do I use it in a week

Yes I can withdraw for crvMUSD but ratio is 1:1. So I guess with later swap for USDC  at Curve I will lose a lot and recieve less than deposited.


[11/15/2021 10:59 AM] Denis P#5257
I tried ETH, DAI - still same error


[11/15/2021 10:59 AM] j.#6352
If you need to withdraw now, i recommend going that route: withdraw to Curve mUSD then withdraw from Curve to your preferred stablecoin


[11/15/2021 11:02 AM] Denis P#5257
With that route I'll lose ~1k of USDC. Because ratio LP for USDC is 1:1.02, and for direct swap is 1:0.99


[11/15/2021 11:02 AM] Denis P#5257
Maybe I got something wrong


[11/15/2021 11:04 AM] j.#6352
ah that could be from the current balance of the Curve pool

[11/15/2021 11:05 AM] Denis P#5257
So Yearn has wrong UI calculation? Because it's still has 1:1.02 ratio


[11/15/2021 11:07 AM] j.#6352
Where are you seeing this? That ratio is the yvTOKEN to Curve LP token ratio, not to stablecoin or USDC


[11/15/2021 11:07 AM] j.#6352
vault token represents curve lp tokens which represent stablecoins in that curve pool


[11/15/2021 11:09 AM] Denis P#5257
At withdraw page at V3 UI, for every 10k LP I recieve 10190 USDC.  
For this second seems like Withdraw button is working  again but gas has 1600$ for withdraw 😄


[11/15/2021 11:27 AM] j.#6352
Always check gas prices before doing anything! https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator
we're at 200 base fee now.


[11/15/2021 1:35 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
Trying  to migrate from the USDC v2 vault to the new vault.  Metamask ask me this  Allow Https://yearn.finance to spend your yvUSDC?   Is this the only transaction or is this a verification transaction and then another gas fee for the actual move ?


[11/15/2021 1:36 PM] j.#6352
This is only the approval


[11/15/2021 1:36 PM] j.#6352
Youll need to do the second one which should appear after the first one confirms

[11/15/2021 1:37 PM] j.#6352
Watch gas prices. we're a bit high at 160 base fee


[11/15/2021 2:03 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
Not impressed here with Yearn - pretty average yield on USDC and now it will all be wiped out with gas fees to move to a new vault. Not very well thought out. I guess everyone makes some good commission on this except for the guy who provided the USDC


[11/15/2021 4:10 PM] kx9x#3778
except you are being defeatist. the old vault is going to continue to yield for a long time. it won't have the new hedged LP provider strats, among other new strats coming, but it can still be partially routed to the new and still have strategies in it for a long time since it is so big


[11/15/2021 4:10 PM] kx9x#3778
this isn't a situation where everyone needs to migrate all at once


[11/15/2021 4:11 PM] kx9x#3778
and your idea of a commission doesn't make sense. it will actually cost yearn much more to maintain 2 vaults (dev resources + gas), but to move forward with new strategies, the vault upgrade must be done


[11/15/2021 4:12 PM] kx9x#3778
UI just needs to be updated to better communicate what makes this migration less urgent than others


[11/15/2021 4:20 PM] ! 0xPeculiar.ali#7941
Can we get listed in tip.cc


[11/15/2021 6:11 PM] kx9x#3778
I don't want to deal with tipping here lol


[11/15/2021 6:11 PM] kx9x#3778
causes so many issues of people being dumb and losing money


[11/15/2021 7:07 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
Defeatist no realist yes. There is no communication from Yearn just a migration button (and it fails in the v3 beta site). So I guess some communication would be good not as you say better - there is none. Why can't the strategies be added to the v2 vault ? Why can't Yearn add a smart contract to transfer my yUSDC  to v3.  Clearly they didn't think that there is no liquidity in v2 now  - so any migration triggers a $1000 gas fee to unwind a strategy.  Yes Yearn strategists  made a lot of "commmission"/mgmt fees on the v2 vault but are happy to ditch it when it suits them .


[11/15/2021 7:07 PM] kx9x#3778
> Why can't Yearn add a smart contract to transfer my yUSDC  to v3.
that is what the migration is. it is a migration contract


[11/15/2021 7:07 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
I can feel the flame coming


[11/15/2021 7:07 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
yep a $1000 contract


[11/15/2021 7:08 PM] kx9x#3778
it isn't ditched though? as I said, it will still be tended to and harvested. it is a huge vault


[11/15/2021 7:08 PM] kx9x#3778
the new strategies cannot safely be added to version 0.3.0 vaults


[11/15/2021 7:09 PM] kx9x#3778
vaults aren't upgradable by design so vaults cannot just rug user funds. unfortunately this means you have to migrate out instead of us able to seize your vault token


[11/15/2021 7:09 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
I don't know if it's ditched - nothing has been said


[11/15/2021 7:09 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
So any comment as to why it costs $1000 to migrate ?


[11/15/2021 7:09 PM] kx9x#3778
also, highly doubt it will actually cost $1000


[11/15/2021 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
show me a TX where someone paid $1000 to migrate


[11/15/2021 7:10 PM] kx9x#3778
guessing you are just getting overquoted by Metamask due to gas limit and max fee


[11/15/2021 7:12 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
and no liquidity in the vault - I guess no one though of that


[11/15/2021 7:13 PM] kx9x#3778
No liquidity? there is plenty. withdraw's implementation will pull funds out of strategies as needed.


[11/15/2021 7:14 PM] kx9x#3778
I think messaging needs to be improved to stop users from freaking out and stressing so much lol


[11/15/2021 7:14 PM] kx9x#3778
no need to fret and have fomo. you will be perfectly fine if you don't migrate. sorry that the UI throws up a stressful warning symbol


[11/15/2021 7:15 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
and that's my point - my understanding is if your withdrawal causes a strategy unwind  - it is multiple transaction and bumps up the fees


[11/15/2021 7:15 PM] kx9x#3778
web team probably could have made a special case UI for this case where we don't really need push migration as hard


[11/15/2021 7:15 PM] kx9x#3778
still one transaction, but yes, more gas intensive


[11/15/2021 7:15 PM] kx9x#3778
but again, if the funds are fully allocated into strategies, there is no need to really migrate


[11/15/2021 7:15 PM] kx9x#3778
a true migration would involve pulling out most funds into a buffer


[11/15/2021 7:16 PM] kx9x#3778
that is cheap to withdraw from and stop tending the vault


[11/15/2021 7:16 PM] kx9x#3778
that is what that warning sign UI was designed for


[11/15/2021 7:16 PM] kx9x#3778
not for this situation where the new vault has a deposit limit and we know that the old vault will be maintained for a while


[11/15/2021 7:16 PM] kx9x#3778
so no need to fret


[11/15/2021 7:17 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
I agree and understand what you are saying. But with zero communication I'm not panicing just coming to the conclusion  Yearn doesn't really care. about the guys who fund.


[11/15/2021 7:19 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
I questioned the liquidity and your like what do you mean there is plenty - but the real answer is plenty with max gas fees to unwind strategies.


[11/15/2021 7:36 PM] inflex#6969
0.4.3 apr is 3% as opposed to obsolete vaults' 10%. Why?


[11/15/2021 7:42 PM] kx9x#3778
that can be biased by migration


[11/15/2021 7:42 PM] kx9x#3778
as people migrate in, the harvested funds get split out to more people than were actually harvesting during the average time period


[11/15/2021 7:43 PM] kx9x#3778
so periods of migration can cause APY to be reduced for a bit


[11/15/2021 7:43 PM] kx9x#3778
it is better to compare APYs across vaults in steady state than two vaults in a migration state


[11/15/2021 8:19 PM] mjade#3094
its been like this forever, seems like teams response is it will just trade where it trades, doesnt seem like they are focused on closing this discount


[11/15/2021 8:20 PM] mjade#3094
I was a big fan of this vault and went in as soon as it came out but there are other options for locking your crv out now and not sure why someone should lock their crv with yearn over competitors


[11/15/2021 9:24 PM] Evo2100#8240
If the Convex reward is reduced, will the yveCRV discount be reduced?


[11/15/2021 9:46 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
What a cluster USDC v0.3.0 with $350M invested marked as deprecated, the migration moves you to USDC v0.4.3 with a $100M limit - that's a stretch


[11/15/2021 10:45 PM] mjade#3094
Well maybe if alternatives suck people will want to lock their crv w yearn. Right now though market is clearly signaling they would rather lock their crv elsewhere


[11/15/2021 11:20 PM] ONI#6888
it will be raised as needed


[11/15/2021 11:22 PM] ONI#6888
The market does decide the price yes, but also we have been buying yvBoost off the market with our veCRV airdrops steadily.


[11/15/2021 11:23 PM] ONI#6888
This is a great critique and I agree maybe it needs another look to see if there are ways we can improve the yveCRV/yvBoost system/incintives. if you have any ideas feel free to post them here


[11/16/2021 12:48 AM] Evo2100#8240
Could you please tell me how to deal with the award of air drop received by Yearn veCRV?


[11/16/2021 12:53 AM] ONI#6888
you dont it gets added to the vault thus increasing share prices


[11/16/2021 12:54 AM] ONI#6888
this is why yvBoost is growing pretty fast, veCRV weekly rewards + airdrops


[11/16/2021 1:29 AM] mjade#3094
i don't know if treasury can provide some type of liquidity even if its an extended period like 30 days. so kinda like bonding w luna where you can swap bluna for luna over 21 days else if you need to swap bluna immediately you get market price. otherwise just need to make the yields really attractive somehow which im not sure what else can be done


[11/16/2021 1:32 AM] mjade#3094
anyway, kinda sad as yearn was really first to pioneer this strategy but personally im kicking myself for continuing with yearn on my crv exposure when convex had better yields. even badger now looks pretty good for crv exposure


[11/16/2021 1:32 AM] mjade#3094
they were more btc only strat vaults but now can get ~100% yield with locked crv and badger boost


[11/16/2021 3:33 AM] viriditas333#3855

Hello, I was wondering when are the APYs for Fantom vaults are gonna be available?


[11/16/2021 3:03 PM] goddrane#9599
Is it safe to put funds into v3 on Fantom?


[11/16/2021 3:19 PM] kx9x#3778
v3 as in beta.yearn.finance? Yes it is


[11/16/2021 3:19 PM] kx9x#3778
those vaults are production vaults and meet all the safety standards


[11/16/2021 3:43 PM] goddrane#9599
Yes, that's what I meant. Thank you 🙂


[11/16/2021 3:56 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
wftm  can be found https://ape.tax/the-fantom
As for the beta.yearn site (where APY is still "new") I believe is based on the team wanting more time for calculation to get an accurate APY (rather than early stages when prices and harvests are more volatile.)


[11/16/2021 5:44 PM] kx9x#3778
I pinged the vault owner


[11/16/2021 5:44 PM] kx9x#3778
right now there is a miniscule 0.05% slippage on withdraw which prevents user withdraw


[11/16/2021 5:44 PM] kx9x#3778
I think they just need to shuffle out some funds from the strategy as a withdraw buffer for now


[11/16/2021 5:44 PM] kx9x#3778
sorry that you are blocked


[11/16/2021 5:44 PM] kx9x#3778
there is a way to withdraw with the 0.05% slippage if you really need to


[11/16/2021 5:44 PM] kx9x#3778
you just have to do it via etherscan and not via yearn ui


[11/16/2021 5:45 PM] kx9x#3778
I can teach you if need to withdraw asap

[11/16/2021 7:19 PM] kx9x#3778
ah you have to migrate


[11/16/2021 7:20 PM] kx9x#3778
migration is best done on yearn.finance


[11/16/2021 7:20 PM] kx9x#3778
weird that nothing happened when you clicked. are you sure you were on yearn.finance?


[11/16/2021 11:09 PM] Epochk56#9910
Quick question - - if the answer is elsewhere I am happy to go read, but wasn't sure where to look. SO, I'm at  beta.yearn.finance on Fantom and trying to decide if I should try out the Vaults. However, for at least two weeks all the APYs simply say "New." This isn't much of an incentive, when I can pop over to the Iron Bank where yields have been fluctuating wildly, and sometimes quite favorably even for stables. Thoughts?


[11/17/2021 3:00 AM] Poor_Rich#2977
I've got some funds in the alUSD vault and am planning a withdraw;  it looks like a withdraw into alusd3crv tokens is around $430 in ETH at a 'low' 80 gas fee?  Can someone let me know if this is accurate?

[11/17/2021 1:31 PM] defiglenn#3350
if thats what it says on metamask then yeah, it sounds like your withdrawal involves multiple transactions so thats probably why the gas fee so high


[11/17/2021 1:32 PM] defiglenn#3350
it's a relatively new vault so not showing just yet, you may be able to see an estimate on ape.tax

actually seems like you should be able to withdraw now

Hi there - I posted a proposal to Yearn's governance forum a few days ago for the Millennium Prize. After posting the proposal, I tried to edit it as I was not sure how to add a poll at the end of it. The anti-spam filter made the post invisible and said it would be visible once cleared by a moderator. I'm a first time user on the governance forum, so if any moderator can help look into this I would appreciate it. I tried asking about this here in the governance channel but didn't get a reply, so thought I'd try the support channel. Thank you.

Hello I have investment in Curve stETH pool. If I choose ETH from SHOW and withdraw, will ETH go directly to metamask?


[11/17/2021 2:33 PM] j.#6352
If you choose ETH on withdrawal, yes, your wallet address will receive ETH


[11/17/2021 2:33 PM] viriditas333#3855

they do not answer


[11/17/2021 3:08 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
I can give you a guess (just don't quote me on this one)
When you get liquidated they are trying to cover the loss against whatever you borrowed (plus 12,5%) so when that time came, the calculation abra uses totaled about 90 yvwFTM to cover what you borrowed, leaving you with a bit of your original stake. 
Hope this helps


[11/17/2021 4:36 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, I don't really understand how you would expect to keep all your yvWFTM and the MIM you borrowed and just subtract the fee


[11/17/2021 4:36 PM] kx9x#3778
that would mean you could just steal money lmao

Hi admins, I deposited soen wFTM into the yearn vaults on fantom a few days ago and received the yvFTM but the the wFTM doesn't show in the vault deposit balance. Any ideas as to why?


[11/18/2021 10:00 AM] arberx#3367
Did you deposit in abra?


[11/18/2021 10:10 AM] SD#1489
Yeah. Is that why? If I withdraw from abra then the balance will show?


[11/18/2021 10:11 AM] arberx#3367
Yeah u removed tokens from yearn


[11/18/2021 10:11 AM] arberx#3367
So of course it’s not going to show on the yearn dashboard


[11/18/2021 10:13 AM] SD#1489
Ah ok, silly me. Thanks for the clarification.


[11/18/2021 11:08 AM] trx314#9669
hi, I have the same issue, did you find how to claim your rewards?


[11/18/2021 11:10 AM] trx314#9669
how is it possible to claim before voting? I don't understand

Are you repaying 0.0002 ETH?


[11/18/2021 12:27 PM] j.#6352
Also it looks like youre using your max ETH balance. maybe dont do that


[11/18/2021 12:30 PM] 4_Cryptonian_1 (⚡,⚡)#7952
I'm repaying .0502 ETH to make it simple


[11/18/2021 12:31 PM] 4_Cryptonian_1 (⚡,⚡)#7952
OK, I see you have to pay it back in chunks.

You'll have to wait for at least 1 harvest, and depending on the strategy, it may also have to be a profit harvest. #🌽mainnet-harvest posts when they happen.


[11/18/2021 1:03 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
not for initial interaction, but subsequent weeks it is possible to vote before claiming previous weeks.


[11/18/2021 2:47 PM] trx314#9669
so this is my first interaction:
- I voted 3 days ago
- I was expecting to be able to claim today (reset) but nothing appears on bribe crv finance (only upcoming rewards)

What I am supposed to do?

could you please explain? I voted, what should I do now?

the answer in the screenshot seems to imply that I should first claim, but how can I claim before voting? there is nothing to claim without voting


[11/18/2021 5:37 PM] kx9x#3778
ah sorry, maybe that is a different issue. Bribe is an Andre project, not a Yearn project, so we usually are the best equipped to deal with these issues 😩


[11/18/2021 5:38 PM] kx9x#3778
maybe someone who used the bribe system can enlighten us a bit


[11/18/2021 5:38 PM] trx314#9669
alright, no problem, I will try to find a solution and will come back here to share if I find out


[11/18/2021 5:39 PM] kx9x#3778
it seems like you might have to wait a week and then you will be able to claim or something? it has only been 3 days, but I also know that curve does their week start on Thursday


[11/18/2021 5:51 PM] trx314#9669
from what I understand from Andre's post, if you vote during a given week, you can claim at the next reset (on thursday), this is why I expected to be able to claim today


[11/18/2021 6:49 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
This may help (from his medium article https://andrecronje.medium.com/bribing-vecrv-gauges-101-8f6e4506bb62) "So if this week I voted for fantom-fusdt pool, then next week I can claim my share of FTM rewards, as well as the following week, ad infinitum as long as rewards are available."

@j. Do you know when the Avg will actually appear on the Yearn/Fantom dashboard? The math is sort of blowing my mind.


[11/19/2021 9:21 AM] ONI#6888
Yes its still a work in progress you can follow this pr https://github.com/yearn/yearn-exporter/pull/150 or comment on the issue here https://github.com/yearn/yearn-exporter/issues/146


[11/19/2021 9:42 AM] trx314#9669
yes thank you
this is actually what I did, I voted last week and now I should be able to claim
but nothing appears on the bribe crv page, only the upcoming rewards, it is like I never voted


[11/19/2021 9:45 AM] trx314#9669
another issue is that it takes forever to load the rewards page, sometimes it does not load at all... so very difficult to do some kind of testing to understand what happens

[11/21/2021 10:39 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Where are you getting that error, in yearn.finance or beta.yearn.finance?


[11/21/2021 10:40 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
The migration process implies sending two transactions, the approval and the migration calls. Have you sent the first one successfully?


[11/21/2021 11:34 AM] Parasitic#6989
It was on yearn.fi, seems like the approval was the issue. On yearn.finance everything works fine. Thanks for reaching back to me


[11/21/2021 11:36 AM] Parasitic#6989
Is it a good idea to migrate now or should I wait for the revamped tokenomics? I mean, will there be a new vault? Fees are killing me

70 gwei base fee currently. should be a good time to do anything you need to do on eth mainnet


[11/21/2021 11:51 AM] Parasitic#6989
Yeah, I know. That's why I was checking all my vault and noticed the migration 😅

Hello, does anyone know what's going on with the TUSD vault? 

Says it's earning 205% APY.

I deposited yesterday, and the amount hasn't changed. 

Is it not active? Some kind of display error?

[11/22/2021 4:02 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
zapping out is for converting your vault tokens to another with 1 button. Lets say you needed DAI but all your funds are in YFI, if you just withdraw, you get YFI, then you have to convert. versus. if you zap out, you can select a different token to recieve

zapper's website you should be able to zap into our vaults


[11/22/2021 5:13 PM] old_frog_#6669
will still be pricey as eth gas is quite high at the moment

np @Unknown also its important to note that depending on when the harvest occurs, and how much TVL is in the vault can make the APY seem higher or lower depending

@old_frog_  Thanks in advance! 🙂

I'm trying to withdraw from 2 vaults, Sushi and Curve IBEur


[11/22/2021 10:25 PM] old_frog_#6669
your funds should be safe, ethereum fees are fairly expensive these days so you're likely seeing an accurate amount that you must pay to withdraw


[11/22/2021 10:27 PM] old_frog_#6669
its important to note that for curve IBEur you'll be withdrawing into the curve LP tokens, unless you want to go directly to ETH, in which case the gas to complete that second transaction will cost more as well since it will stack and execute the transaction for you


[11/22/2021 10:27 PM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413
Oh no, my concern is not the high gas fees, I'm worried cause all I see are gas fees, I don't see my money at all


[11/22/2021 10:28 PM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413

as long as you input the amount you'd like to withdraw, that should execute within your transaction


[11/22/2021 10:29 PM] old_frog_#6669
since you're withdrawing and not spending, the Amount+gas is actually just Gas since you are not removing from your wallet


[11/22/2021 10:30 PM] old_frog_#6669
if you were to deposite from your wallet into lets say one of the ETH vaults


[11/22/2021 10:30 PM] old_frog_#6669
it would include the ETH amont + Gas fee


[11/22/2021 10:30 PM] old_frog_#6669
if you were to withdraw, it would be the same as you're experiencing now, just showing the gas fee to complete the transaction

Interesting, ok I think that makes sense, sorry I'm super new to the world of vaults


[11/22/2021 10:31 PM] old_frog_#6669
no worries! we're always here to help


[11/22/2021 10:32 PM] old_frog_#6669
its always good to ask if you're unsure. hopefully that helps !


[11/22/2021 10:34 PM] trillan616#8939
i withdrew my ydai from the yearn v1 earn dai vault and the transaction is still pending it’s been over 5 hours and max gas fee is $370


[11/22/2021 10:34 PM] trillan616#8939
why hasn’t it been approved yet this is really high gas

Monitor gas prices here https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator
You might have used a lower gas price for your tx

[11/22/2021 10:38 PM] j.#6352
Yes


[11/22/2021 10:38 PM] trillan616#8939
how do i get the transaction to go through


[11/22/2021 10:38 PM] trillan616#8939
speeding it up says i pay a max up to 900$


[11/22/2021 10:39 PM] j.#6352
Which wallet software are you using? If Metamask, there should be a **Speed Up** button. Click that and bump up your gas price to somewhere around current gas prices or higher


[11/22/2021 10:39 PM] trillan616#8939
metamask


[11/22/2021 10:40 PM] trillan616#8939
when i do that it says it costs $980


[11/22/2021 10:40 PM] j.#6352
your screenshot shows 70 gwei which is too low


[11/22/2021 10:40 PM] j.#6352
the USD value doesnt matter


[11/22/2021 10:40 PM] trillan616#8939
ok that’s what yearn automatically set it is


[11/22/2021 10:40 PM] j.#6352
always check gas prices before sending any tx


[11/22/2021 10:41 PM] j.#6352
it can spike up from the estimates


[11/22/2021 10:41 PM] j.#6352
or you could just wait it out if you want to


[11/22/2021 10:44 PM] trillan616#8939

[11/22/2021 11:06 PM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413
Any idea how I can solve this


[11/22/2021 11:17 PM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413
@old_frog_  This is the token I see on Metamask Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool: ibEUR/sEUR, can I convert this to USD or some other mainstream token like ETH?


[11/22/2021 11:21 PM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413
"Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool: ibEUR/sEUR"


[11/22/2021 11:23 PM] j.#6352
How did you get to that token in the first place? Just reverse the steps you did


[11/22/2021 11:52 PM] trillan616#8939
also why did yearn set the gas limit to over 1306029 when previous transactions were going through with a limit of 140000

[11/23/2021 2:20 AM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413
I got to that token by zapping in my ETH


[11/23/2021 2:20 AM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413
But there is not enough liquidity to zap out ETH


[11/23/2021 2:20 AM] j.#6352
You cant zap out?


[11/23/2021 2:21 AM] j.#6352
how about a different token then swap to ETH manually?


[11/23/2021 2:21 AM] Deepak_P_MidMarch_2021#3413
zap out isn't working


[11/23/2021 2:21 AM] Tasal#0739
so if I don't repay my whole loan at once it is able to go through. But this means I will have to make two tx's


[11/23/2021 2:21 AM] Tasal#0739
or more


[11/23/2021 2:22 AM] j.#6352
You'll have to do this manually then: Withdraw from the vault, go to Curve and withdraw from the LP


[11/23/2021 2:22 AM] j.#6352
you can leave a tiny bit of dust


[11/23/2021 2:22 AM] Tasal#0739

[11/23/2021 1:50 PM] old_frog_#6669
sorry you had expectations for vault to stay at 600%.. most vaults cant keep that level of APY because people see that performance and stack into the vault diluting the apy


[11/23/2021 2:21 PM] MAurelius#8220
I entered when it was 200% with 1M TVL. 

Now it’s 2.5M TVL and paying 1%.

That makes no sense.


[11/23/2021 2:22 PM] MAurelius#8220
Also no harvests have taken place because balance hasn’t changed


[11/23/2021 2:22 PM] MAurelius#8220
Something broken there. Predicted APY went up as the amount of funds in the vault went up.


[11/23/2021 4:06 PM] old_frog_#6669
when did you enter?


[11/23/2021 4:06 PM] old_frog_#6669
I saw over $1.5M enter the vault within the last two days when i took a closer look with other users who entered that vault


[11/23/2021 4:08 PM] old_frog_#6669
The 1% sounds accurate... there is only ~$72k in that strategy that yielded a pretty significant amount, which is why that APY was so high, the TVL flooding in over the 3 days since last harvest unfortunately did not update the predicted APY concurrently. The APY was updated yesterday as far as I'm aware


[11/23/2021 4:47 PM] jacknoddy#8959
Hello there i am having an issue on the v3 ftm vaults. anyone that can help? there is no way to withdraw anything from my position even thought the vault says there is over 157K$ in assets


[11/23/2021 5:04 PM] jacknoddy#8959
@old_frog_  dunno if correct to ping you but just wanna know whats going on :S


[11/23/2021 5:05 PM] old_frog_#6669
hello, you should be able to withdraw with no problem. What vault are you withdrawing from and what error are you seeing


[11/23/2021 5:06 PM] old_frog_#6669
also did you allocate your vault shares to abracadabra by chance?


[11/23/2021 5:06 PM] jacknoddy#8959
nop


[11/23/2021 5:06 PM] jacknoddy#8959
it is FTM network it is the USDC vault


[11/23/2021 5:06 PM] jacknoddy#8959
i just get RPC error all the time... but if i try to withraw 0.000001 usdc there is no problem


[11/23/2021 5:07 PM] jacknoddy#8959
on the vault contract there is at the moment only 0.000002 usdc remaining

ah yes I'm seeing this now, looks like all the assets are currently in use in strategies


[11/23/2021 5:12 PM] jacknoddy#8959
ok so is just a matter of wait for harvest and freeing up some assets right?


[11/23/2021 5:12 PM] old_frog_#6669
i think so, i will confirm for you


[11/23/2021 5:12 PM] jacknoddy#8959
first time this happens to me on a big player like yearn


[11/23/2021 5:12 PM] jacknoddy#8959
that is why i was a little bit worried :S


[11/23/2021 5:14 PM] old_frog_#6669
yes, you're also using a fairly new vault on FTM compared to ETH vaults


[11/23/2021 5:14 PM] old_frog_#6669
but your funds are safu, will have some more info on what to expect but i think the conclusion we're currently at is the way forward


[11/23/2021 5:14 PM] old_frog_#6669
wait until a harvest occurs and/or strategy frees up some USDC


[11/23/2021 5:15 PM] jacknoddy#8959
ok!!! thanks anyways i will keep an eye on the contract as i have not found any bots declaring ftm strategies harvest


[11/23/2021 5:37 PM] kx9x#3778
shouldn't matter. we shouldn't block user withdrawals on the funds being in the strategies, if you cannot actually withdraw any USDC beyond the amount in the vault, then that is a bug


[11/23/2021 5:37 PM] kx9x#3778
try to see if you can withdraw 2379. Sometimes knocking off the decimals fixes the json rpc error


[11/23/2021 5:38 PM] jacknoddy#8959
nothing


[11/23/2021 5:38 PM] jacknoddy#8959
i can only withdraw only 9 USDC now


[11/23/2021 5:38 PM] jacknoddy#8959
because someone just deposited 10


[11/23/2021 5:38 PM] kx9x#3778
I see, let me ask the strategists about it

[11/23/2021 5:41 PM] jacknoddy#8959
that is the only reason i am able to "withdraw" 10 usdc because someone else has deposited. anyways i will not sign the tx because not gonna be taking other people deposits...


[11/23/2021 5:41 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, the intent is that even if the vault doesn't have idle funds


[11/23/2021 5:41 PM] kx9x#3778
you should be able to withdraw, it will just pull from the strategies


[11/23/2021 5:42 PM] kx9x#3778
sometimes this doesn't work if the strategists didn't setup the withdrawal queue well and the first strategy to withdraw from could have some slippage


[11/23/2021 5:42 PM] kx9x#3778
asking internally about it


[11/23/2021 5:50 PM] jacknoddy#8959
yeah i know, usually when there is no idle funds and you withdraw that tx is more expensive because has to move funds from the strategies... but first time withdrawing from yearn and I did not know if this was the case here as well


[11/23/2021 6:15 PM] jacknoddy#8959

How come the price to deposit in a lab is alot higher then the one for other transactions on the eth chain? Is it because it performs multi steps?


[11/24/2021 5:20 AM] j.#6352
Could be. It depends on which token youre coming from


[11/24/2021 5:22 AM] Shin#8846
Directly from ETH


[11/24/2021 5:22 AM] j.#6352
Then yes, usually


[11/24/2021 5:23 AM] j.#6352
but the vaults under Labs could be cheaper if you just buy the vault tokens on Sushiswap. yveCRV and yvBOOST are available with ETH pairs on Sushiswap

When will the wftm vault on ftm chain start to generate yield? I just checked, the vault seems to be inactive, the exchange rate when wrapping wftm to yvwftm didn`t change the last 30 days...


[11/24/2021 1:23 PM] j.#6352
it's been harvesting but yield is currently super low. the last harvest was just over an hour ago

(answered in #🗣general  thank you for posting here!)


[11/24/2021 7:02 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Try sushiswap, or maybe curve.finance, or possibly zapper.fi.
It's very inefficient but you could redeposit into vault and withdraw a different token (under the "Withdraw: To Wallet" you can select a token other than crvUSDN.)
Hope this helps (or hopefully someone smarter than I has  better answer :peepoblanket: )

thx for the response. i figured it out. the vault was V2. the vault deposit shows on the new site but i had to go to the legacy site to withdraw my funds. frustrating not to get any help but easy once i figured it out

i havent claimed my SPELL from bribe.crv.finance for couple of weeks because of gas and just noticed my balance of claimable spell decreased with like 40%, why is that?


[11/25/2021 12:06 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Bribe isn't a Yearn product, and beyond the github and a medium post i'm not sure there's much information out there on it. Post to the curve discord, they may have someone who knows a bit more.


[11/25/2021 12:30 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Do you have a source for this info?
My understanding is that nexus mutual has coverage for some vaults (https://gov.yearn.finance/t/nexus-mutual-yearn-vault-by-vault-coverage/10911) but afaik none of our vaults utilize the nexus token in their strategy (but i'm also still learning!)

I assume slippage limit is too low or this specific zap route is unavailable. Try using Zapper directly https://zapper.fi/vaults?appId=yearn&contractAddress=0x528d50dc9a333f01544177a924893fa1f5b9f748&modal=vault-deposit

what's a good method of seeing when a vault has an idle cash- trying to move out of USDC and the gas cost is stupid I assume because there is no idle cash


[11/26/2021 1:49 PM] defiglenn#3350
I don't think that's necessarily because of no idle cash

Why does yvBoost price not seem to correlate with CRV? With the runnup in CRV recently I thought my yvBoost tokens price would also increase, but it seems the opposite. I thought yvBoost should have exposure to CRV since the strategy locks up and auto-stakes veCRV?


[11/26/2021 2:39 PM] fr0gpil0t#2768
Thanks for the help - yes trying to withdraw  when there is  idle cash is more cost effective

Hello. Can please someone explain why Curve ibKRW has APY 60,28% but the Earnings over time is 0?


[11/27/2021 5:20 AM] ONI#6888
My guess is that hasnt yet been set up for these vaults since they are newer. They are still working normally and are making 65% apy

Hi! I get the following message "Error Returned error: execution reverted: Error Swapping Tokens 1" when trying to withdraw from the CrvLink v2 vault.  Does anyone know how I can fix this? I've tried using zapper, but somehow it only works with slippage set to 17% or higher. Zapper and Yearn.fi shows the same amount, but at yearn.finance it's about 12k difference in balance. I have withdrawn from the vault before with no issues. Help is much appreciated.


[11/27/2021 8:48 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Are you trying to withdraw sLINK instead of LINK? The pool is highly unbalanced hence you can suffer big slippage

I can't find an option for sLINK. I have yvCurve-LINK, trying to swap for either LINK, USDC, DAI, ETH. What is strange is the difference in balance on the yearn.finance and yearn.fi. About 13k difference right now.


[11/27/2021 9:00 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
You can withdraw crvLINK and go to curve.fi and withdraw the liquidity in whatever token you want, sLINK or LINK


[11/27/2021 9:22 AM] Laks#2328
Okay, thats good. 
In that case I have to fix the error Error:

[11/27/2021 12:45 PM] j.#6352

Well I am trying to borrow using abracadabra, but it doesn’t show yvUSDC as an option. I thought it might only show things active in your wallet

Thanks for the reply. I deposited in Curve IbGBP 2 days ago and the amount of crvIbGBP tokens still the same. So now for the 2 days APY is 0. As i see in a strategy yearn deposits it on convex, than harvest CVX and CRV, sells it and increase ibGBP+sGBP. How do you know how often this happens? Thanks.


[11/27/2021 10:03 PM] defiglenn#3350
Hey uhdsissls, can see in the Harvest channel that the 2 last harvests were on the 12th november and 26th october, so that gives you an indication of how often it happens


[11/27/2021 10:11 PM] uhdissls#5773
thanks a lot. Found. "💰 Net profit: 0.0000 ibGBP+sGBP-f ($0.00)" - both of times. It means that this vault actually has a 0 profit in a last month?


[11/27/2021 10:13 PM] defiglenn#3350
yeah looks like it, not sure why


[11/27/2021 10:15 PM] uhdissls#5773
And the same situation with the most Ib vaults. Only ibEUR vault sometimes has a profit


[11/27/2021 10:16 PM] uhdissls#5773
It strange that on curve dashboard all Ib vaults have a most high APY but the most of them has a 0 profit


[11/27/2021 11:04 PM] ONI#6888
For now its best to just wait till harvest happens. Right now the vault has a low amount of funds so it wont harvest a frequently as others with more funds. You are still earning that apy though, best to just be patient

[11/27/2021 11:10 PM] uhdissls#5773

I mean why Net profit is 0 when harvesting, while funds in this vault has been deposited on Convex and should collect CVX and CRV. Sorry for noob questions I am new. I just want do discover how it works for myself but can't find any info.


[11/28/2021 3:30 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
From where are you trying to withdraw?


[11/28/2021 3:36 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
The TVL of the vault is extremely low , less than $300k. The harvest you saw where only to move funds from the vault to convex, so they didn’t generate any profit. “Harvest” doesn’t only mean take profit anymore but also adjustment of the strat or move funds without taking profits

[11/28/2021 4:59 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Usually when it’s profitable to do so, for very low TVL vaults it takes time to generate enough rewards so gas spent harvesting it doesn’t eat all the profits

@Unknown hi mate. I'll clean up (ie delete) messages in #✔v3-ui-feedback as it's strictly for UI feedback only. Continue here in #❓support-questions 

My guess is your zap is failing because there either is not enough liquidity to do the steps from the token you're depositing with, or this specific zap route is unavailable. This is probably on Zapper. I recommend swapping to a different, more usable token first


[11/29/2021 4:13 AM] Trung#3949
I followed ur suggestion and set the gwei at the Fast rate from ethgas.watch but it is still failing. Perhaps I should double it?


[11/29/2021 4:22 AM] Trung#3949
I even went in and set the limit to 200,000 and migration is still failing .

[11/29/2021 12:24 PM] defiglenn#3350
Maybe try restarting your browser?


[11/29/2021 12:58 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
I think so, simulation fails because you don’t have enough eth to pay for gas

hello need help


[11/29/2021 6:24 PM] Optimus_1984#4091
I am trying to either migrate my yusdc v2 or withdraw the funds. I approved one transaction for $27 and now it is asking me to approve another transaction for $700 plus which is worth more than the usdc i am trying to remove. Is there a solution to this or am i doing something wrong?


[11/29/2021 6:54 PM] old_frog_#6669
that sounds accurate, the first transaction was to approve interaction with the contract. 

The second transaction does sound a bit high, most likely due to ETH congestion + gas fees. this is definitely a pain point for ethereum and trying to utilize defi with the amount of $ you have in the vault. 


Yearn has currently launched a set of vaults on FTM network where fees are much cheaper and will cost 99% cheaper to withdraw or interact with in general. Understanding this doesn't necessarily help with your current situation.


[11/29/2021 6:59 PM] Optimus_1984#4091
So there is no optimum solution then to leave the money there?


[11/29/2021 7:05 PM] old_frog_#6669
Actually there is a new solution that i’ve seen that pools users funds together to migrate.

Hi all, I wanna withdraw some ETH from my stETH vault holdings and would love some advice. 🙏 
Firstly, is there a difference between withdrawing from YFI site vs. withdrawing via Zapper?
Secondly, approximately how much gas fees should I expect to pay for the withdrawal transaction? (say gas rate is 100gwei)


[11/30/2021 2:38 PM] defiglenn#3350
Don't think there would be any difference because its just 1 transaction going from stETH to ETH I think. Regarding gas fees, you can check by attempting the transaction. You don't have to go through with it


[11/30/2021 2:44 PM] j.#6352
Should be the same. Zapper is integrated in Yearn's *zaps*

I have some mim in the vault. If i want to withdraw, it says i would get crvMIM. But i would like to get something, i can sell, lol. But zapping is just too expensive, to withdraw from mim to eth or usdc. Wait for lower gas?

Probably wait for lower gas. In the withdraw window, you should be able to select something other than crvMIM (see if it saves you some.)

zapping requires more steps so its always going to cost more than taking out the curve pool token.


[12/02/2021 5:28 AM] tnrg#9669
What about when you use a multisig and the eth comes from a separate address? Are those slippages and fails still relevant?


[12/02/2021 5:29 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
I’m not sure but as far as the sender has eth, he pays the gas


[12/02/2021 5:29 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Also not sure if you have the option to connect to the website a multisig


[12/02/2021 5:30 AM] tnrg#9669
Yes. You do. It works fine. I feel more comforable using the old yearn UI I think.


[12/02/2021 5:40 AM] tnrg#9669
The gas cost is independent of the amount invested. From USD-> CrvMim it works for $10k but slippage rapidly increases as the amount of USDC to be deposited increases.

When will I get my first earnings ?

I see the yield is showing 0%.


[12/02/2021 2:53 PM] defiglenn#3350
I think thats because it's a new vault, when the first harvest comes through a APY / yield will be calculated and show. Up to you if you want to wait till that point

Good day! Please tell me, does anyone understand how "yvBOOST-Holding" at "yearn-Labs" works ?
In what units is the "BALANCE" of an investment quoted ?
Why, when trying to withdraw ("WITHDRAW"), the incoming "VALUE" of the "BALANCE" = $ 5200, and the outgoing "VALUE" of the "BALANCE" (the one that is withdrawn to the wallet) = $ 2600 ?

[12/04/2021 10:25 AM] j.#6352
The USD values of yveCRV and yvBOOST are different. You can check and confirm this on Sushiswap, aggregators, and Coingecko


[12/04/2021 10:28 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
Thanks, I know that. But the situation is different. I have value that costs 5200$, why I withdraw the value that costs 2600$ ?


[12/04/2021 10:32 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
It seems to me that this is a bug in the new version of the yearn platform.
This was not the case in the old version.


[12/04/2021 10:33 AM] j.#6352
you're right. it should be around 2700 yveCRV. if i remember right, this is on the UI and you wont actually get 2328. let me confirm


[12/04/2021 10:36 AM] j.#6352
I think so too. Reported this. Any reason why youd rather withdraw to yveCRV instead of selling for stables?


[12/04/2021 10:37 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
Sure, if the current BALANCE is quoted in yveCRV, then it is 2783:

[12/04/2021 10:38 AM] j.#6352
Yes this is correct. Balance shows the underlying token of the vault, not the vault token itself. So yveCRV is what that Balance shows


[12/04/2021 10:39 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
Yes, I have important reason )) This is my secret ))


[12/04/2021 10:39 AM] j.#6352

peepohehe 

[12/04/2021 10:48 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
First screenshot shows the amount in yvBOOST now. This amount does not change from the beginning of my deposit (one and half month ago). Second screenshot shows the amount in yveCRV now. This amount contains earned @profit@ . Initial amount in yveCRV was approx. 2679


[12/04/2021 10:49 AM] j.#6352
Yes your yvBOOST vault tokens amount will not change (unless you withdraw or deposit more), but the underlying yveCRV tokens will


[12/04/2021 10:56 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
Yes, you are right, thanks.
We have correspondence:
2679 yveCRV  -->  2328 yvBOOST     October 2021, when I started the deposit
2783 yveCRV  -->  2328 yvBOOST     now
I think, that the value in yvBOOST does not take the @profit@
I have already encountered a similar situation in other deposits.


[12/04/2021 10:59 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
But this is not the main thing.
The main thing is that I see an error in the assessment of my outgoing assets.
It doesn't have to be.


[12/04/2021 11:00 AM] j.#6352
Yea it's just a UI thing for the withdrawal box. Already reported. If you really need yveCRV, just sell yvBOOST for yveCRV for now


[12/04/2021 11:04 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
That is, there is nothing terrible here?
And there is no mistake here?
And will I get exactly 2783 yveCRV to my wallet? (Of course, I must pay gas-price)


[12/04/2021 11:05 AM] j.#6352
No, this is not 100% confirmed. Do not continue the withdrawal on the Yearn website if unsure. I recommend selling for yveCRV on Sushiswap instead


[12/04/2021 11:06 AM] j.#6352
the swap transaction is probably cheaper on gas too, than withdrawing


[12/04/2021 11:18 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
Wait a second, WHAT will I sell (change) on Sushiswap if my yveCRV-s are staked on Yearn?  I was going to get them from Yearn - Vault ! ))


[12/04/2021 11:19 AM] j.#6352
Sell **yvBOOST** for **yveCRV**

[12/04/2021 11:20 AM] j.#6352
Yearn Vault tokens are ERC20. They are transferrable to any address like any other token. With available liquidity, this can be tradeable


[12/04/2021 11:27 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
Yes, thank you very much, I have done this several times already and I know this procedure. But, probably, I have to finish the "WITHDRAW" procedure from my deposit on Yearn?
Because at the moment I have neither yveCRV nor yvBOOST in my wallet.


[12/04/2021 11:29 AM] j.#6352
If youve done this several times, then you should have either of those tokens in your wallet. Withdrawing or swapping between those two cant make them disappear


[12/04/2021 11:44 AM] Just-Afternoon8888#0695
Yes, that's right, yvBOOST is in my wallet in the same initial amount of 2328 pieces ... But how can this be if I "staked" it on Yearn?
It turns out that I can always take the deposit back without resorting to the "WITHDRAW" procedure?
But at the same time, probably, I lose all the earned "profit"?


[12/04/2021 11:45 AM] j.#6352
Please please please read through the above. It should be more than enough to clear this.


[12/04/2021 11:46 AM] j.#6352
Your yvBOOST has earned a certain amount. You personally confirmed this by seeing an increased yveCRV value


[12/04/2021 11:46 AM] j.#6352
So you do not lose this earned profit


[12/04/2021 11:46 AM] j.#6352
The value of 1 yvBOOST token has increased since your deposit


[12/04/2021 11:47 AM] j.#6352

Super! Everything worked out!
And I didn’t know that it’s possible at all!
The first swap did not go through, and at first I thought that there was a mistake in the idea itself. But then I read the documentation and decided to try again, because I was doing the first swap for a very long time, the price could just go away.
I did the second swap quickly, and everything worked out.
Thanks so much for the amazing tip! 😀

Is the MIM vault the only one you are in? I'm wondering if it was because of the available assets (https://yearn.watch/network/fantom/vault/0x0A0b23D9786963DE69CB2447dC125c49929419d8)

Odd to get simulation failure but still be able to interact with contract directly. I'll let you know if I hear anything from the support team.


[12/04/2021 9:19 PM] D$#5671
I think the sim doesn't match the contract. The docs suggest the stables to collateralize up to 90%, but the frontend starts freaking out when you go over 80%


[12/04/2021 11:37 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
@Unknown try going to yearn.finance and see if that displays your balance


[12/04/2021 11:42 PM] Trung#3949
Ok, maybe I jumped the gun in interpreting your suggestion but How exactly do I "withdraw normally to the Curve LP?"  On https://yearn.finance/#/vaults It shows me withdrawing to my triCrypto wallet only. And when I try going to https://curve.fi/tricrypto/withdraw It is showing a 0 balance for all 3 coins  See screenshots attached

Ok.. I think I'm outta the woods. Figured out why that red Migrate button wasn't working. It was because i was already connected to Yearn using my coinbase wallet but Curve only like Metamask. Had to clear cache and cookies and reconnect with metamask. But I just realized I made a bonehead mistake. i migrated to triCrypto2 instead of 3Crypto . Oh wells. Thanks for your help though.

Hey, I'm from the Origin Protocol team. There's an OUSD vault strategy that was recently added and we've had a couple of community members ask about lack of yield. The TVL is currently quite low at about 160k. Is there a minimum TVL required before the vault will deploy the funds?

Anywhere I can get more info on this would be great so I can explain it. Thanks.


[12/05/2021 3:46 PM] kx9x#3778
Harvesting profits will only be lucrative once there is good enough expected profit. With 160k TVL, it might take a while to get to the first harvest. Harvesting frequently with such low TVL right now probably wouldn't be economical


[12/05/2021 3:47 PM] kx9x#3778
I think either pending profit hits 80k and we harvest early, or it will be every 3 weeks at worst


[12/05/2021 3:47 PM] kx9x#3778
With 160k TVL, to hit 80k pending profit in less than 3 weeks would require pretty insane APY from the underlying convex strategy


[12/05/2021 3:48 PM] kx9x#3778
So yeah, as long as TVL remains very low, harvests will be infrequent


[12/05/2021 3:48 PM] kx9x#3778
Else yearn would be using more gas than what yearn takes home with the 2% mgmt fee

[12/05/2021 4:24 PM] Dadd#7584
yes. I had a tab open from before that event that showed the balance with yearn


[12/05/2021 4:24 PM] Dadd#7584
was wondering why. this makes sense. so when I unwind it will reappear


[12/05/2021 4:25 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah, once you use those as collateral to borrow MIM, then they aren't owned by you anymore, they are in abra's system


[12/05/2021 4:25 PM] kx9x#3778
and you can unwind or repay debt to get your collateral back

Uh, I am kinda freaking out right now, because my USDC vault shows up as containing zero value. I invested there just about a month ago. I was still in the old vault and was going to transfer into the new one at some point soon, so I hope this is related to that in some way and my investment is secure. But, I am very nervous because there are transfers I see on ethplorer.io from a couple days ago that I did not authorize to addresses I do not recognize. It's my biggest single investment, so yeah, I am kinda freaking out. Any insight or guidance?

If you see transactions in the explorer that you do not recognize as your own, your address is compromised. Move all funds/coins/tokens to a new address ASAP

If using a hardware wallet, you can just add a passphrase to your existing seed phrase. Otherwise, generate a completely new seed phrase

Odd maybe hard refresh the site (cntl+shift+r) clear you cookies, reinstall metamask (if u use a seed make sure it's backed up) (admins will never *ever* ask you for your seed or dm u first), try in incognito mode.

Hi all, I've been trying to withdraw from the sETH (v2) vault for the past week now, but the fee hasn't gone below $300 in the estimated price ranges. I tried a custom one but the transaction didn't go through and took the gas fee. what is the recommended gas and gas limits?


[12/08/2021 8:25 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
You shouldn’t touch the gas limit set by the wallet, if you decrease it there is a possibility it’s not enough and the transaction will ran out of gas and you’ll still pay ETH gas fee

{Reactions}
👍 

[12/08/2021 8:27 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Right now there are more than 2k crvstETH shares sitting in the vault, it should be quite cheap to withdraw from it


[12/08/2021 8:28 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Unless you’re not withdrawing curve shares but something else, which implies using zapper to make swaps that increases the gas cost of the transaction


[12/08/2021 8:36 AM] Username#3504
no im withdrawing curve, but fees still say in the 300's :/

great I moved it over to my metamask but I still want to withdraw as well. I tried setting the gas based off the etherscan average but it failed (95 gwei, 103013 gas limit) any other recommendations I can try?

Define “failed”

"out of gas" but the transaction history says it used 102,000 out of the 103,000 gas limit

thanks I appreciate it, been scratching my head over this for a while now. Fairly new to it but I have some idea of what should fail and not fail


[12/08/2021 11:16 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
You selected withdraw to ETH instead of crvstETH shares, that transaction is more expensive than just withdrawing curve shares


[12/08/2021 1:13 PM] Username#3504
whenever I try to withdraw as crvsteth shares I get simulation failed so I tried to convert and withdraw instead

[12/08/2021 3:42 PM] Armstrong🤖💵💵💰💰.#0469
same here, with the current yearn.finance (v3), i haven't seen "simulation successful" (tried many times) when withdrawing directly to the underlying curve LP token (luckily, v2 UI still works fine). Also, my connected wallet(s) got more than 0.5 naked ETH, so it can't be lack of gas. Also ctrl+shft+r hard refresh, cleared cookies...

When trying to convert to sth else (usdt, usdc, dai, eth, wbtc...), simulation success but when click the withdraw button, it returns sth like zapper api unsuccessful and nothing pops up in my wallet to sign.

After a while, i used v2 to withdraw from the vault, and then went to curve to manually do the rest...

Hopefully the web team can figure out what's wrong


[12/08/2021 6:08 PM] x48#7385

So I screwed up.  Haven't been paying attention when the yearn Curve.fi GUSD/3crv (yvgusd3CRV) v1 vault stopped working.  Am I screwed or is there a way to convert it to Curve.fi GUSD/3crv (GUSD3CRV.)  Its been so long I cannot remember what to do.  I tried looking for the coin pairs on sushiswap and other exchanges.


[12/09/2021 2:12 AM] j.#6352
You should be able to withdraw from the Yearn vault and then from the Curve pool after that


[12/09/2021 6:35 AM] Username#3504
I tried withdrawing just the tokens instead of converting and withdrawing on v2 yearn but the gas is still absurdly high

does it matter which withdraw option? 26-29?


[12/09/2021 7:15 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
The number 25 is the default option, withdraws the maximum amount of shares and return the tokens to the same address where you have the yvtokens


[12/09/2021 7:16 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
The other numbers allows you to withdraw less than the maximum or to change the recipient address


[12/09/2021 7:16 AM] Username#3504
still says my gas is in 300's


[12/09/2021 7:17 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
How maybe shares are you withdrawing? What’s the gas limit set? The base fee is around 70 gwei, what’s the wallet using?

[12/09/2021 7:38 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
I see now the problem, I was looking at the steth vault instead of the seth vault. There aren’t any funds inside the vault hence the withdraw will cost more because the funds need to be extracted from the strategy

the gas is still within the acceptable range though, does that mean I just have to do whatever they estimate?


[12/09/2021 7:39 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
I’ll send you some eth back to cover the gas spent, you’ll have to wait for someone else to deposit in the vault or make the expensive withdraw


[12/09/2021 7:40 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes, the estimation always overkills by a bit the amount necessary but it’s a good approximation


[12/09/2021 7:44 AM] Username#3504
alright, I had a feeling i'd just have to bite it and pay the est fee but still sucks. Thanks for all your help though, at least I now know the cause and avoid it next time


[12/09/2021 7:45 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
You can watch the vault contract address and see the balance of crvseth tokens, when there are more than the amount you want to withdraw it’ll cost around $30


[12/09/2021 7:47 AM] Username#3504
pretty sure I got one of the lowest too though lol

[12/11/2021 3:12 PM] bahrfer#9801
I have a pending approval transaction for withdrawing from Yearn's Curve alUSD vault that I sent in with low gas a few weeks back. That approval was for contract 0xa74d4b67b3368e83797a35382afb776baae4f5c8 (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x786553cc2fb64eca063b798ec68f190f44577a7bdb1517eea46be0bbcaf07e59). Looking at the v3 UI, when I try to withdraw I can see that it asks for approval on the contract 0xd6b88257e91e4e4d4e990b3a858c849ef2dfde8c instead. So my questions:

1. Will my approval for the 0xa74d contract allow me to withdraw funds and zap out to ETH? If so, how can I interact with that contract since the UI doesn't seem to anymore.
2. Or is that approval basically a no-op? Trying to decide if I should speed up that old approval or cancel it in Metamask.


[12/11/2021 3:20 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
You’re calling the approve function of 0xa74 that is the vault to spend the yvtokens in 0xd6b8


[12/11/2021 3:22 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
The input of the approval call (spender address) is d6b88257e91e4e4d4e990b3a858c849ef2dfde8c


[12/11/2021 3:24 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Which is the zap out contract


[12/11/2021 3:38 PM] bahrfer#9801
ok, so the pending approval is the correct one, and I can use the UI normally to zap out after it's mined?

[12/13/2021 6:24 PM] FiZiX#7038
Hello, probably a dumb question but is there still a way to move my yDai to a new vault without withdrawing it? It will cost me more in gas than it's worth to withdraw.


[12/13/2021 8:51 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Not a dumb question at all! At the moment I don't believe so. Wido gets close with doing batch vault migration, but I'm not sure it covers transferring to a completely different vault, and I'm not sure yDAI would fall into their scope.


[12/13/2021 9:12 PM] FiZiX#7038
Shoot. Is there a way to move my yDai  to a new version at least? Right now it's not making any interest


[12/13/2021 9:31 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
It would still be both a "withdraw" and "deposit" contract interaction. I think you have to wait for when gas is really cheap. You could also ask in Wido's telegram too if they plan on launching for yDAI. (https://www.joinwido.com/)

Yes will have some rough edges but should work. My suggestion would be to leave any claims on it open for 1 week before adding any remaining SPELL balance back to bribev2


[12/15/2021 10:34 PM] wavey#9439
This is how the bribe contract works. Basically everything refreshes after a week.

from the message it appears you don't have enough funds, either enough to cover the deposit or enough gas to pay the transaction.


[12/16/2021 2:07 PM] justme83#1858
that can't be, I have atleast 9 FTM in my Metamask, that should cover the gas fees for any transaction on the Fantom network easily.

[12/17/2021 7:09 AM] j.#6352
oh right. i misunderstood. how i understand is that tokens on Fantom are completely different/separate from Ethereum mainnet in that they are not 'real' or something like that. i dont completely remember. 
"real tokens are held in multisig bridge on the ethereum side, and anyswap issues a fantom version on fantom. you’re basically giving anyswap your real DAI and they give you monopoly money"

If you connect your wallet to the Yearn website, https://yearn.finance you should see a banner telling you to migrate. If you dont see it, try the v2 site https://v2.yearn.finance/vaults or the v1 site https://v1.yearn.finance/vaults.

Hi guys, bit of a noob question here. 

Trying to deposit some DAI into the vault on fantom, but I am facing some errors.

1. Do the vault get full/ have a limit? I keep getting a 'Exceeded Deposit Limit' error.

2. However, when I lower my deposit amount, I get a 'Internal JSON-RPC Error' instead

Any idea what is wrong?

[12/18/2021 5:15 PM] defiglenn#3350
That's a weird one, maybe you'd have to withdraw to a metamask for it to be visible


[12/18/2021 5:28 PM] ScottB#5267
YFI has always been weird in the Ledger wallet. It nests them in an ETH account and it has always been a pain. I think the MM route might be easiest but hate to burn the gas.

[12/18/2021 7:17 PM] defiglenn#3350
From what i've seen from insurers in this space they don't always cover when theres an exploit because it isn't say a 'smart contract exploit', like maybe it was one of the teams fault so the insurance doesn't pay out


[12/18/2021 7:17 PM] defiglenn#3350
So my conclusion was to avoid insurance and just only deposit on defi apps that I believed I could trust

[12/18/2021 9:47 PM] setninja#2741
I disagree with defiglenn and think insurance rates at places like nexus are actually mispriced (too cheap) and therefore an interesting option. For example, insurance on cream finance was 2.5% even after there were two prior exploits.

He is indeed correct that it doesn't cover every scenario though, like badger for example: where the hacker took advantage of less savvy defi users by getting them to approve a foreign address. This was a frontend exploit and not covered.

Just find the steth pool


[12/19/2021 10:52 PM] arberx#3367
And you can swap for eth


[12/19/2021 10:52 PM] arberx#3367
Yearn lets you get out in eth, but seems you didn’t do that


[12/19/2021 10:52 PM] Inaros#0806
ah ok thanks man


[12/19/2021 10:53 PM] arberx#3367
So you have to manually swap to eth


[12/19/2021 10:53 PM] arberx#3367

Nah its gonna be 1.1x this week, and we will remember that in the upcoming reduction basically


[12/20/2021 3:34 PM] wavey#9439
Where does the SPELL originate from? If there’s a stockpile maybe you could just add it all to some new contract which has a public function anyone could call weekly to add some configured bribe amount.

Hello - The value of the EURT+3CRV vault is not being reported correctly. The value of an LP token is something like $2.15, but yearn dashboard is valuing it closer to a dollar...


[12/20/2021 5:44 PM] neb#2114
apparently the "virtual price" reported by curve contracts is not valid for "crypto" pools... I believe this is source of problem

[12/20/2021 6:09 PM] MJ899#8912
nothing worked so far.. now amount of loan is 5889.. i am only repaying 5887.. 2dollars short could that be reason


[12/20/2021 6:13 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Maybe? I think amount change would kick the error "tx failed" (slippage or amount) rather than "json-rpc" < which usually deals with the connection to the network.
I'm trying to search through previous resolutions, I think I remember somebody updated the RPC (even though nothing changed) and it worked


[12/20/2021 6:15 PM] MJ899#8912
ok so something strange happened.. it accepted 5830 repayment .. but i still owe 59 dllars

[12/20/2021 6:16 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
^would you mind dm'ing me the transaction hash? I'll check if I can see anything.

[12/21/2021 10:26 AM] j.#6352
current workaround is to do this in individual steps instead of zapping out. Withdraw to Curve LINK, withdraw from Curve, swap to ETH


[12/21/2021 10:27 AM] j.#6352
approvals like this one should only happen once. have your previous approvals been confirmed?

This might be the best option for now just don't zap and withdraw manually. I will see if that zap is working fine

The board its linking to is the strategists private task board, will see why that is a link if nobody can view it. I believe this is just an overview of how it would work, generally most people who are deploying a strategy are yearn contributors.


[12/21/2021 8:37 PM] michael4766423#8371
So we can't just show up, code a strategy, set up a repo, and then submit it if not contributors?


[12/21/2021 8:37 PM] ONI#6888
No you can do that. Ofc it would need review, feedback, and probably iterations but yes a non-strategist/current contributor can code up strategies for yearn vaults, in fact we encourage it.

ibkrw vault doesn't appear to be showing the correct APY.  It's showing 42% apy, after the first harvest taking 18 days since depositing.  I'm calculating a 7% APY based on earnings and deposit amount?  Am I missing something here?

Regarding Iron bank - I don't see anything in the docs about liquidations. 

Do they happen? If so, is it when your collateral reaches the collateral factor e.g. 90%? Or is it when it reaches 100%? Thanks so much!


[12/22/2021 2:06 PM] j.#6352
i think it has only done one profitable harvest from an amount less than the current total amount in the vault so far which was yesterday https://yearn.watch/network/ethereum/vault/0x528D50dC9a333f01544177a924893FA1F5b9F748/strategy/0x73c3533c159F93C924f072B065F9DAA6C0445Be2

Im not sure. I also dont see it in the CREAM docs. If you're in their Discord, try asking them. Under-collateralized borrowing is only for protocol to protocol lending/borrowing. so im not sure how it is for individual users

I am looking at etherscan  transactions for CRV depositing into yveCRV and then to yveBOOST. The depositor receives the yveCRV token 1:1 to the deposited CRV.


[12/22/2021 5:49 PM] svtmd1#0341
But the yveCRV is trading at less then 1/2 CRV right now. Thats almost a 50% haircut on deposit.  What am I not getting?


[12/22/2021 5:51 PM] kx9x#3778
There is no way with withdraw yveCRV back to CRV


[12/22/2021 5:51 PM] kx9x#3778
So the price difference represents the premium people are willing to pay to trade back to CRV


[12/22/2021 5:52 PM] kx9x#3778
Right now it is much better to just buy yvboost or yvecrv than to deposit


[12/22/2021 6:19 PM] Michael22#6567
I'm on ETH network


[12/22/2021 6:28 PM] Michael22#6567

[12/22/2021 8:15 PM] svtmd1#0341
But cvxcrv seems to closely follow crv. I just saw someone deposit $60k in crv to yVe and received $31k in yearn value.  I’m not sure people realize what they are getting when they deposit.  If the yearn tokens have such little value, I still get the advantage of yveCRV and getting your 3crv forever.  But why would anyone convert crv to yboost.


[12/22/2021 8:17 PM] kx9x#3778
I would instead sell my crv to buy these tokens rather than deposit. it is a nice arbitrage


[12/22/2021 8:18 PM] kx9x#3778
imo it is one the person depositing for not comparing different options on how to get the token


[12/23/2021 1:54 AM] j.#6352
Not necessarily. I think for this one, it's because not all of the current vault funds were used to earn that yield. so the (APY x TVL) might be off if you're comparing with that. anyway, APY is typically an average over a week, but can default to over a month if not enough data


[12/23/2021 1:54 AM] j.#6352
or something like that


[12/23/2021 1:55 AM] j.#6352
your (APY x deposit) calculations will never be super accurate to the 0.000001 decimal. it just doesnt work that way

[12/23/2021 4:07 PM] kx9x#3778
are you withdrawing to 1inch tokens or to some other asset?


[12/23/2021 4:07 PM] kx9x#3778
simulation can fail if you are trying to withdraw to a different token that doesn't have good liquidity with 1inch


[12/23/2021 4:07 PM] kx9x#3778
the simulation protects you from a failed transaction due to slippage


[12/23/2021 4:30 PM] robrei#4620

You can use the yearn.fi UI to withdraw or v2.yearn.finance

Neither of those have simulations. Not sure why it fails

Will try, but is the vault really inactive? It wasn't last Sunday. Thanks

I think the only strategy was deprecated. 1inch staking ended.


[12/23/2021 5:03 PM] robrei#4620

Yes. Tried again with additinal gas and worked. The error was due to low gas in my wallet, but should it appear after in metamask instead? Or maybe add an additional message to check gas in wallet. Bye and thankd

Hi, I’m not able to deposit into the weth vault, it just blanks out the deposit but


[12/25/2021 10:21 AM] Hello_friends#0976
Bit*.   I also get a ‘YvBoost-Eth positions error’ when I connect my MM, not sure if this is related.  The wallet section of yearn isn’t connecting properly either


[12/25/2021 10:44 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
Hi - not sure if Curve MIM vault has any withdrawal issue?

Nop it shouldn’t


[12/25/2021 11:01 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Where are you seeing that? Yearn.finance on mobile?


[12/25/2021 11:01 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
the Curve MIM vault, ser


[12/25/2021 11:01 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
but now it recovered


[12/25/2021 11:02 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
I have a question regarding zapper vault that connects to yearn's Curve MIM vault and able to cash out in MIM stablecoin


[12/25/2021 11:02 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
not sure about the service fee (or commission) that zapper take from this


[12/25/2021 11:02 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
So you can now withdraw?


[12/25/2021 11:02 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
None


[12/25/2021 11:03 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
yes, ser. I can withdraw from this


[12/25/2021 11:03 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
Basically, I withdraw through zapper without going to Curve myself and it also save me the gas. Am I correct?


[12/25/2021 11:03 AM] patrick_ds#0886
Hi, I'm having issues with approving a vault deposit. I did one yesterday. 
Message on metamask is Transaction decoding is not available for chainId 250 
I cant confirm the transaction (the button is offline)


[12/25/2021 11:03 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yep


[12/25/2021 11:04 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
jeez, that saves lots of gas


[12/25/2021 11:04 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Zapper doesn’t charge anything on top for users, they benefit from being a yearn partner (they take a cut from the fees charged by yearn)


[12/25/2021 11:05 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Not that much, you still need to approve first


[12/25/2021 11:05 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Probably you’re confusing that transaction with the actual withdraw


[12/25/2021 11:06 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
hmm. true


[12/25/2021 11:06 AM] xaobtceth (∞)🦇🔊#6632
thank you


[12/25/2021 11:06 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Which vault are you depositing?


[12/25/2021 11:09 AM] patrick_ds#0886
FTM chain on wFTM


[12/25/2021 11:11 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Deposits on that vault look normal


[12/25/2021 11:12 AM] patrick_ds#0886
i did one yesterday, it went well. doing it a second time I had trouble with the deposit, so I canceled in metamask. Now it shows this "Transaction decoding is not available for chainId " on data tab.


[12/25/2021 11:12 AM] patrick_ds#0886
Im doing with metamask. + ledger


[12/25/2021 11:16 AM] patrick_ds#0886
and the explorer doesnt show any issues


[12/25/2021 11:23 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
I just deposited successfully in the vault with my ledger + MetaMask


[12/25/2021 11:28 AM] patrick_ds#0886
Yes, probably is some issue with my metamask or error in the my side.


[12/25/2021 11:28 AM] patrick_ds#0886

Hello, what does it mean when I'm trying to deposit a token from a wallet to a vault and I get "simulation failed"?


[12/25/2021 7:32 PM] robrei#4620
Hi had the same issue while withdrawing. Probably you need more ETH to pay gas. Try also yearn.fi.


[12/25/2021 7:48 PM] iris.nevins#6404
Thank you!


[12/25/2021 7:49 PM] iris.nevins#6404
What does it mean if I have made a deposit but it is not appearing in my vault yet? The metamask transaction went through and now my yearn interface says "Your transaction has been sent to the network" but it's been 44 minutes


[12/26/2021 12:11 AM] old_frog_#6669
It sounds like you may have approved the contract, which is it's own transaction, but have not deposited with another transaction


[12/26/2021 12:12 AM] old_frog_#6669
Is the token you wanted to deposit still in your wallet?

oh hi j


[12/26/2021 11:21 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
so what if i took a regular USDT, then took it to curve, entere3d it into tricrypot, but did NOT stake in guage


[12/26/2021 11:21 AM] j.#6352
You cant deposit vault tokens in the Curve Tricrypto pool. That's not how it works


[12/26/2021 11:22 AM] j.#6352
you can only deposit USDT, ETH, or wBTC


[12/26/2021 11:22 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
but what about that image tahat shows the token in the vault


[12/26/2021 11:22 AM] j.#6352
Yes this works


[12/26/2021 11:22 AM] j.#6352
This is how you should do it as i described earlier


[12/26/2021 11:22 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
right but nobody giving 15% for a LP of tricrypto


[12/26/2021 11:23 AM] j.#6352
USDT > Curve Tricrypto > Yearn Curve Tricrypto Vault


[12/26/2021 11:23 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
well its here but does it work it doesn't show an intrest rate


[12/26/2021 11:23 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
will it self execute the yeild once i stake in there?


[12/26/2021 11:24 AM] j.#6352
A new vault shows *new* under the APY column until it gets a few harvests to get an average


[12/26/2021 11:25 AM] j.#6352
If you want to wait until a number is displayed, you can do that


[12/26/2021 11:25 AM] j.#6352
you can also just deposit now and wait

[12/26/2021 11:30 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
ahhh, superb. taht's fantastic. . . im not very smart, but im kind of obsessed with finding a 'strategy' of my own for some reason. . . can you think of any good youtube vids or white papers whatever, that explains how tokens work/wrapped v unwrapped, interest, compounding, fees, token burns for xsushi or xJOE


[12/26/2021 11:30 AM] j.#6352
super new


[12/26/2021 11:30 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
i want to understand how tokens can be torn apart and put back together, as well as i can, like waht PENDLE did with the YT and OT


[12/26/2021 11:31 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
i found yearn's white paper for aspiring developers, way too difficult LOL


[12/26/2021 11:31 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
its right there on the yearn site but its crazy difficult for a non-programmer


[12/26/2021 11:31 AM] j.#6352
That's a loaded question and im not in a position to give financial advice. also i dont use youtube for these things. Mabye Finematics and Ceazor. other than that, most are clickbait garbage


[12/26/2021 11:32 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
im a lawyer, dont worry, im trying to learn about tokens


[12/26/2021 11:32 AM] j.#6352
Yearn vaults are intended to be *deposit and forget (for a while)*


[12/26/2021 11:32 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
i coulnd't sue an advisor because any judge/jury would probably conclude that im as sophisticated if not moreso than whoever was giving the advice to begin with


[12/26/2021 11:33 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
yes, yearn vfaults are fabulous, but i do want to find a strategy of my own, to do that i tink i need to understand better the intricacies of how tokens can be ... atomized and reconstituted


[12/26/2021 11:33 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
im sure you've used PENDLE? they split ownership rights from yeild rights of a token. fascinating


[12/26/2021 11:34 AM] j.#6352
nope


[12/26/2021 11:35 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
you've helped a lot, im gonna just be messing around with what you've already shown me thanks a lot my dude


[12/26/2021 11:36 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869

[12/26/2021 11:52 AM] j.#6352
Yup. any extra rewards will be claimed for you and you will see this as additional yield


[12/26/2021 11:52 AM] j.#6352
like in the FTM vault. Yearn received a Fantom grant, distributed in the vault. APY got a bump up because of this


[12/26/2021 11:53 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869

[12/26/2021 11:54 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
when i put those tokens into abracadabra, was i still makign 11%?


[12/26/2021 11:56 AM] j.#6352
Yup. but you wont see this on the Yearn website anymore since you'll be depositing your vault tokens on a different platform


[12/26/2021 11:59 AM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
that's very difficult to understand for me, but i'll dig into it and see if i can figure it out with a brute force attack lol


[12/26/2021 12:17 PM] warweaverBiTcHeZ#9869
what is the significance of curve radio button enabling you to 'Swap wrapped' . . what happens to the wrap staking it on curve?


[12/26/2021 12:30 PM] j.#6352
Just in case you have any relevant wrapped tokens. Makes deposits slightly more convenient


[12/26/2021 5:56 PM] proggrezive#1841
hey i do have some curve steth lp tokens in the yearn vault that i did deposit some time ago with my trezor wallet, now im trying to withdraw and once i try to sign the transactions it gives me an error ERROR: UNKNOWN MESSAGE ..

Best to keep any support for yearn to public channels, no common issues require private DM.

Zaps to Curve ibFF vaults seem to not work reliably. Refer to these as a workaround: https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/734862139386232902/924652681493110794

Did your transaction confirm? Failed transactions are also mined/confirmed, and i dont see any in the transaction list of Curve ibKRW


[12/27/2021 2:15 PM] pr0tosolo#0001
It looks like its still on the pending block for curve


[12/27/2021 2:15 PM] j.#6352
then you havent lost anything (yet)


[12/27/2021 2:16 PM] j.#6352
wait for that to confirm, then come back here to report if anything happens. if it confirms, fails, etc

Hi. I'm new here. I have two questions.


[12/28/2021 1:34 AM] KingJohn#5338
1. The Yearn Dai vault on Fantom claims to be paying around 19% APY, but over the past few days, my annualized returns have been about 5.5%. So where does the 19% come from?


[12/28/2021 1:34 AM] KingJohn#5338
2.  Once I deposit my DAI, I get yvDAI in return. Is there anything I can do with these tokens? For example, can I use them as collateral somewhere?


[12/28/2021 1:34 AM] KingJohn#5338
Thanks in advance for any info shared.


[12/28/2021 2:43 AM] kx9x#3778
apy was boosted up because of this:
https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/735617936206594249/924168532953022484


[12/28/2021 2:43 AM] kx9x#3778
Fantom gives FTM grants to protocols with high TVL and the first batch was donating to all FTM vaults


[12/28/2021 2:43 AM] kx9x#3778
that spiked the APY


[12/28/2021 2:44 AM] kx9x#3778
19% is calculating with that, which is wrong to assume it will happen super often


[12/28/2021 2:44 AM] kx9x#3778
it will go back to normal soon


[12/28/2021 2:44 AM] kx9x#3778
but we will get more grants so it might spike again in the future


[12/28/2021 2:44 AM] kx9x#3778
and no, there is no other thing you can do with yvDAI on FTM


[12/28/2021 2:45 AM] KingJohn#5338

[12/28/2021 10:51 AM] svtmd1#0341
Is it more gas efficient to use the fixeforex.fi platform to deposit in a curve pool and stake LP on YEARN? Or should I deposit in Curve pool directly on curve site and then stake in Yearn from the Yearn.finance site? Also, will fixedforex allow single asset deposit to curve pools?


[12/28/2021 11:10 AM] j.#6352
I think they use the same contracts which makes the end result the same. Just different UIs
Looks like it does. You can just enter the amount of one side of the pair then deposit

[12/29/2021 1:13 AM] iyield#8108
Hey first time poster here. Thanks in@advance@for@answering my questions: 1) right now, or@at least a few mins ago, the iron bank on fantom had Dai and mim at like 165% apy and the yearn fantom Dai and mim vault@were still at their like 19% and 15%. My question is, do the Dai and Mim fantom yearn vaults@utilize iron bank assets when the apy is that high? Or do the Dai and Mim fantom@vaults never utilize the iron bank and they’re completely@separate. I’m just wondering whether I should be investing in the Dai and Mim yearn fantom vaults AND putting some money on the Dai and Mim assets in iron bank? Or@is that redundant?


[12/29/2021 1:16 AM] iyield#8108
And second question: for the iron bank: I was under the impression that I xould@deposit some@assets to the iron bank and then deposit those@lp@tokens into the iron bank curve protocol on fantom. This is all on fantom network by the way. But do I still get the underlying apy of each of the iron bank assets i deposited in addition to the 11% apy of the iron bank curve protocol? I was under the impression I did but when I was withdrawing from@theniron bank protocol on curve it put the withdrawing tokens in equal distribution (usdt, usdc, and Dai) and since I didn’t remember which assets from iron bank I specially had lp’s@for, I don’t understand how my@underlying assets could have been getting apy the whole time


[12/29/2021 1:22 AM] old_frog_#6669
have you reviewed the DAI vaults performance?


[12/29/2021 1:22 AM] iyield#8108
Yes


[12/29/2021 1:23 AM] iyield#8108
What im@really@asking is. Is the Dai vault@completely@separate from@the iron bank@Dai asset?


[12/29/2021 1:23 AM] iyield#8108
I’m just wondering whether u guys in investing will put money in like a@dai or@mim@fantom yearn vault and also iron bank fantom


[12/29/2021 1:23 AM] old_frog_#6669
have you reviewed the strategy for that DAI vault?


[12/29/2021 1:24 AM] iyield#8108
It doesn’t really say. Except maker


[12/29/2021 1:24 AM] iyield#8108
But I get your point. The strategy would say if it utilized iron bank


[12/29/2021 1:24 AM] iyield#8108
Is there anywhere besides the fantom yearn app I could look?


[12/29/2021 1:25 AM] old_frog_#6669
Depends on what you want to do but simple to just use the vault.


[12/29/2021 1:26 AM] old_frog_#6669
yearn.watch


[12/29/2021 1:26 AM] old_frog_#6669
shows all the strategies for the vaults.


[12/29/2021 1:27 AM] old_frog_#6669
i just looked, seems like 10 strats deployed at the moment


[12/29/2021 1:29 AM] old_frog_#6669
use dark mode to get rid of hasselhof


[12/29/2021 1:41 AM] iyield#8108
Ok thank you. Seems like the Dai vault prob has been programmed to@take@advantage of iron bank apy going through the roof on Dai. Always funny when you think you’re the only@one who’s discovered a way to get higher apy 😜🤪


[12/29/2021 1:41 AM] iyield#8108
Thanks. I appreciate your help

[12/29/2021 5:31 AM] KingJohn#5338
I don't really understand your explanation. The 19% APY on Yearn's DAI vault (Fantom) is flat out wrong. It's yielding about 5-6%. So is that 19% (more like 18.6% now) that is being advertised a moving average that reflects higher rates from the past?


[12/29/2021 8:08 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
the spike comes from a donation to the vault coming from extra rewards given by fantom foundation


[12/29/2021 8:30 AM] KingJohn#5338
But as a depositor to that vault, I am not getting 18.x%, right?


[12/29/2021 8:58 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
returns are not constant, the rates shown in the website are averages over a certain period or time


[12/29/2021 9:00 AM] KingJohn#5338
Right. So it is a moving average. Can I find out that length of time in the documentation? (Could you point me in the right direction?)


[12/29/2021 9:14 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
If it hasn’t changed, it’s or 2 weeks or 1 month

Having trouble connecting my wallet to the yearn page. When I click connect wallet nothing happens except the scrollbar on the side of the page dissapears. Ive tried different browsers and different PCs and they all do this


[12/29/2021 1:42 PM] JB#3080
Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?


[12/29/2021 1:54 PM] defiglenn#3350
That's weird. Id recommend restarting your PC and doing a hard browser refresh ctrl + shift + r or shift + f5

Hey! I got my WETH back in may (as I remember) and want to withdraw my money...but now I connect my wallet and it shows 0 balance on dashboard, but when I go to yearn (in beta v2) looks like there is still WETH which can "can be safely withdrawn, now" but when I request withdraw value in transaction is 0$

This is on Metamask. It doesnt consistently displays tokens in the transaction preview window. You should be able to receive your WETH after confirming

Also, this is the v1 site. you might be confusing the beta and v2 for it. they're all different. but seeing that you have a balance in v1 in that screenshot, just go with the withdraw in v1

Hey I promise I read through the docs to try to understand this and I searched yvBOOST but just want to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. So with the yvBOOST I dont necessarily need to deposit, right, I can just buy yvBOOST off the market and that would be the same as using yveCRV into the vault(to get yvBOOST tokens)?


[12/29/2021 3:24 PM] decap#0286
All I need to do is hold the yvBOOST token to get the rewards/compounding of the yvBOOST strategy?


[12/29/2021 3:28 PM] j.#6352
Correct :peepo_big_brain:


[12/29/2021 3:28 PM] j.#6352
Yes :peepo_big_brain:


[12/29/2021 3:29 PM] decap#0286
How do you exit the vault then? Is the only pair to do so the yvBOOST/Eth pair on sushiswap?


[12/29/2021 3:32 PM] j.#6352
It was always meant to be a one-way vault. The Sushiswap pool existing came after, and it's the *only* way out


[12/29/2021 3:35 PM] decap#0286
Damn, so the only way to take profits is the sushiswap pool then?


[12/29/2021 3:35 PM] j.#6352
Technically it's to withdraw to yveCRV then claim 3crv then withdraw to stablecoins


[12/29/2021 3:36 PM] decap#0286
How do you withdraw to yveCRV?


[12/29/2021 3:40 PM] j.#6352
on the yearn.finance website, click Labs, then withdraw from yvBOOST to yveCRV


[12/29/2021 3:41 PM] decap#0286
I only see deposit, not withdraw


[12/29/2021 3:41 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
You can’t withdraw from yveCRV


[12/29/2021 3:46 PM] xKnight#1657
hi yearner quick question


[12/29/2021 3:46 PM] xKnight#1657
i dont uderstand the iron bank apy


[12/29/2021 3:47 PM] xKnight#1657
what means apy for borrowing?

[12/29/2021 3:47 PM] defiglenn#3350
What don't you understand? It's based on past performance


[12/29/2021 3:47 PM] j.#6352
you cant claim yvecrv from yvboost?


[12/29/2021 3:47 PM] defiglenn#3350
Is there not headings at the top? One is for borrow and one is for supply


[12/29/2021 3:47 PM] xKnight#1657
i know that but i gain apy even if i borrow on my collateral in this case fustd?


[12/29/2021 3:47 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes you can, but can’t claim CRV from yveCRV


[12/29/2021 3:48 PM] kx9x#3778
you pay that apy to borrow

[12/29/2021 3:48 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Just double checked and misunderstood the question, F


[12/29/2021 3:48 PM] decap#0286
so the only way to take profits/exit yvBOOST is selling it on the yvBOOST/Eth sushiswap pair with pretty bad slippage?


[12/29/2021 3:48 PM] j.#6352
:kms:


[12/29/2021 3:48 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes and it’s actually not that bad


[12/29/2021 3:49 PM] decap#0286
not trying to be snide but i was looking at $100k position looks like almost 4% in slippage


[12/29/2021 3:49 PM] j.#6352
you should eventually be able to claim 3crv rewards. that's the purpose of yvecrv


[12/29/2021 3:49 PM] decap#0286
on sushiswap


[12/29/2021 3:49 PM] j.#6352
but selling is easier


[12/29/2021 3:49 PM] j.#6352
so might as well


[12/29/2021 3:49 PM] decap#0286
when will we be able to do that, its an upcoming feature?


[12/29/2021 3:50 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Very fair

https://crv.ape.tax/


[12/29/2021 3:50 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
If you have yveCRV you can claim directly on yearn.finance


[12/29/2021 3:51 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
If you hace yvBOOST those rewards are claimed weekly and sold for more yveCRV


[12/29/2021 3:51 PM] decap#0286
thats $4k seems kinda nasty


[12/29/2021 3:51 PM] decap#0286
on a $100k vault


[12/29/2021 3:52 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yup, no incentives no liquidity


[12/29/2021 3:52 PM] decap#0286
but thats the yvCRV vault tho right that doesnt apply to yvBOOST vault?


[12/29/2021 3:53 PM] j.#6352
I havent actually done this myself. so i cant confirm with experience, but you *should* be able to get your yvecrv if you have yvboost


[12/29/2021 3:53 PM] j.#6352
and by extension 3crv


[12/29/2021 3:53 PM] kx9x#3778
there are incentives. you get sushi rewards for staking yvBOOST/WETH


[12/29/2021 3:53 PM] j.#6352
not sure why youd wanna do that though


[12/29/2021 3:53 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
It’s not a feature, yveCRV gives you the right to weekly 3crv rewards since forever


[12/29/2021 3:54 PM] decap#0286
are you sure can anybody confirm


[12/29/2021 3:54 PM] decap#0286
thank you guys for the thorough explanations btw


[12/29/2021 3:54 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah just call withdraw on the vault contract


[12/29/2021 3:54 PM] j.#6352
👆


[12/29/2021 3:54 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes you can withdraw 100% sure


[12/29/2021 3:54 PM] j.#6352
there you go decap


[12/29/2021 3:55 PM] j.#6352
yvBOOST to yveCRV to 3crv to whatever stables on Curve


[12/29/2021 3:55 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
The only way out is trading on sushi


[12/29/2021 3:56 PM] decap#0286
so if i hold yvBOOST, I can exit the vault by calling withdraw on the yveCRV vault


[12/29/2021 3:56 PM] decap#0286
how do i do that im not a codoooor

{Reactions}
airenelmao2 

[12/29/2021 3:56 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
In yearn.finance


[12/29/2021 3:56 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
yvBOOST is more liquid than yveCRV I believe


[12/29/2021 3:58 PM] decap#0286
where do you see that i only see deposit no withdraw


[12/29/2021 3:58 PM] decap#0286
yes i just looked that seems to be the case

ok all good then thanks again folks


[12/29/2021 4:05 PM] decap#0286
one last question, so you can withdraw yvBOOST --> yveCRV and then yveCRV can be withdrawn for CRV?


[12/29/2021 4:05 PM] j.#6352
3crv, not CRV


[12/29/2021 4:05 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Nop, you need to also sell yveCRV on sushi


[12/29/2021 4:05 PM] decap#0286
ahh ok so it is indeed yvBOOST is the best way to take profits/withdraw


[12/29/2021 4:06 PM] kx9x#3778
holding yveCRV makes it so you can claim 3crv rewards from curve admin fees each Thursday


[12/29/2021 4:06 PM] kx9x#3778
it is not a way to withdraw nor exit a position. it is just the yield from holding the token


[12/29/2021 4:06 PM] kx9x#3778
yveCRV or yvBOOST can be sold on sushiswap


[12/29/2021 4:06 PM] decap#0286
but no bribe buyback right


[12/29/2021 4:06 PM] kx9x#3778
bribe buyback is done with yvBOOST

weird discrepancy in deposit amount and vault amount shown, this is for YFI on ftm. I assume its just an issue with fetching the appropriate price since token quantity is the same

https://bribe.crv.finance/ isn't working for claiming my bribes. The transactions don't seem to have the gas set correctly. And using metamask to speed up or cancel the transaction fails too. So it has effectively stopped me from making any further transactions at the moment. I may have to set the nonce and cancel them that way..

Hello! I’m  stuck on issues connecting my wallet to my yearn vault. I do have funds add to my vault, over the Holladay I tried adding to my vault and was unable to Walletcontact. Nun of the features were functional. It seems to have frozen on all browsers, I'v tried. I retorted my Mettamask still nothing. I tried reaching out on Twitter but only get fish scammers. I only open browsers threw my metamask or trustwallet. Has any one over come this issue yet! Or has had an issue like this? I would like to continue too use yearn finance. I have WFI TOKENS INVESTED AND THIS issue is holding me back..

Yes! I Tried that method many time still with out results. Would this be blockchain technology that will clear up all underlying wallet bugs that affect wallets normal processes? Like a security check. I have tried different browsers with out success.

[12/30/2021 4:21 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
If you’re using MetaMask, use the browser inside MetaMask app and open yearn.finance on it


[12/30/2021 4:24 PM] M4rzxs#5198
Yes! thats what I usaly do when using Dapps. Is there any way to clear browser on Mettamask? I haven't tried but I restore Mettamask.

Hi sorry, don’t fully understand that. I have seen the yields and it has been low. But is there a resource where I can see historical performance to validate whether I should be using Yearn in the first place, if objective is 5 - 10% on stable. Thanks and apologies as new to all this.

Hi, when I withdraw MIM from the vault on fantom, I click max button, the vault said that insuffient fund. But when delete all decimal number, it worked. Anyone got this issue?


[12/31/2021 4:20 AM] john_dewitte#8042
Hi. I was convinced that I migrated my DAI from v2 in august but the app is asking me to migrate again. Did the vault migrate again? It feels like the vault in which I am does not perform anymore. Transaction for the migration was the following (0xa37f9076bff06e88c688669a095c24498c221bdf48be15d66817f10c2774ac88). Thank you for your help.


[12/31/2021 4:23 AM] j.#6352
yup this is common. just take out the super tiny decimals


[12/31/2021 4:25 AM] j.#6352
You unfortunately did not complete the migration. If you look at the tx, you only sent the approval tx. This *only* gives permission to the contract to use/take/spend your (old) yvDAI to be able to be migrated to the new DAI vault.

Ok thanks. Do you know if the vault is still running despite the v3? Or I should migrate ASAP?


[12/31/2021 4:43 AM] j.#6352
v3 is only for the UI. Vault products are still in v2 spec. That aside, no, you arent earning anything significant in that iteration of the vault. Best to migrate when you can


[12/31/2021 5:28 AM] noat#5476
Hmm, I think this is common issue with decimals. But we can solve it by use input as string combine with BigNumber as calculation 😋

Hi I have a question concerning the yield in the WFTM Vault on Fantom. Since three days I'm invested and I calculated that I'm supposed to earn ~1 USD every day. But in fact it's just 0.01 USD. Is there something wrong? Or are rewards calculated not daily?

In need of help re: APY 53% for crv ibEUR/sEUR. If the crv gauge for this pool pays a boosted 17+% in CRV. So how come the premium between  ibEUR-sEUR-f and yvCurve-ibEUR is only 3%. When I deposit my ibEUR-sEUR-f in Yearn, I reeive about 3% less yvCurve-ibEUR shares. I know its only been available for 98 days but shouldn't the difference be much greater by now?


[12/31/2021 11:57 AM] svtmd1#0341
What is off with my calc


[12/31/2021 2:43 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
the vault had only 2m AUM until early december and was only harvested for big earnings less than 1 week ago, the 53% APY was the original returns when the vault launched but since it hasn't been harvested too often there isn't accurate data to show any other APY estimations. Now that the vault has more than $20M TVL it'll be harvested more often and the APY shown will be more and more accurate

[12/31/2021 5:34 PM] svtmd1#0341
Ty. So I can use the crv ibEUR-f/yvibEUR ratio as a sort of surrogate of actualized APY.  I can use the “harvest” tag here on the discord to track any harvest. But how come on the etherscan explorer for the yvibEUR, when you  ‘read’ the contract under ‘harvest’ there’s no info ?

you’d have to verify in the abracadabra discord


[01/01/2022 5:43 AM] old_frog_#6669
if ur asking about liquidation from Spell/abra then there is a % fee in thr same place where they show the interest fee


[01/01/2022 5:43 AM] old_frog_#6669
its labelled liquidation fee, essentially they get an extra x% when you get liquidated on top of what you owe

wondering whats next to get in on yearn vault


[01/01/2022 10:39 AM] j.#6352
ok great. you have two choices: 
1. deposit that in the vault directly on the Yearn website. With Zapper.fi's power, the other choice will be done for you in the backend so you wont have to do anything else. 
2. deposit ibKRW in the Curve pool: https://curve.fi/factory/2/deposit then deposit the resulting Curve LP into the Yearn vault


[01/01/2022 10:40 AM] j.#6352
With choice 1, you'll have to approve the token on Yearn, then deposit. With choice 2, you'll have to approve the token on Curve, deposit on Curve, approve the LP token on Yearn, deposit on Yearn


[01/01/2022 10:41 AM] j.#6352
choice 1 is the easiest and quickest, but choice 2 gives you more control over each step if you need to

{Reactions}
🙏 

[01/01/2022 10:44 AM] MJ899#8912
ok with both choices afterward is s set and forget thing.. or I have to claim and restake, more gas fees? plus is the Apy shown after or before fees? thanks you for you r help


[01/01/2022 10:46 AM] j.#6352
With Yearn, you dont have to claim and restake (basically compounding). Yearn does the compounding for you. APY is after fees.


[01/01/2022 10:47 AM] j.#6352
Also, APY is an average-ish over an amount of time in the recent past - weekly. So it's typically not an indication of present yield right now or the future.

{Reactions}
🙏 

[01/01/2022 10:49 AM] MJ899#8912
you are awesome.. ok and i see that to excute step 1 is to go under wallet ,then deposit tap correct? on yearn site


[01/01/2022 10:50 AM] MJ899#8912
so means I dont have to get Lp or anything else ..just deposit and let go??


[01/01/2022 10:53 AM] j.#6352
Correct. Choose your token (in pink) and enter amount or *max*. In your case, it would be ibKRW since you already have it. Then approve the token (in yellow). After that tx confirms, deposit (in green). If that confirms, you should be good.

Hello, can anyone explain how to withdrawal all your dust from Yearn vaults?

What I don't understand is you pay FTM for Network fees but you click Withdrawal Max on a non-FTM token (MIM or wFTM, i.e.), it will say Insufficient Funds and you have to leave some dust behind in order to withdrawal most. Makes no sense. Thanks for clarifying

[01/02/2022 1:29 PM] j.#6352
Zapper might have some issues with this zap. I saw recent zaps to deposit in it that were successful but also got some reports of errors like yours. The workaround for this is to do each step yourself. Coming from DAI, you have to get ibEUR, deposit in Curve, then deposit in Yearn. Another way is to swap MIM for ibEUR on https://fixedforex.fi/swap then zap to the Yearn vault with ibEUR. If that still doesnt work, deposit ibEUR to Curve and then Yearn like previously described


[01/02/2022 1:30 PM] noveltea#9213
Ok, thanks!


[01/02/2022 11:19 PM] svtmd1#0341
Yes tried the same maneuver unsuccessfully with eth. I think it’s a liquidity issue. Therefore zap wont go through with ibEUR unless you change the slippage to a crazy 12+%.  Imo best strategy - if from DAI- use MIM. Minimal slippage converting on sushiswap. And then Fixedforex.fi for the rest of transaction all the way or Yearn as mentioned above. Don’t use curve for swaps - usually 2-3x $$ of sushi. Just do all these transactions when gas is low. Can all be done under $200. But could also be $600.

ignore last message. Just saw the updated docs


[01/03/2022 3:14 AM] ltd#2192
how does choice 1 work? you go onto zapper.fi?


[01/03/2022 4:07 AM] j.#6352
You can go to the Vaults page of Yearn or on Zapper. Zapper and Yearn point to the same zap contracts for Yearn Vaults. So either one should work ok. The advantage with using Zapper.fi directly is that you have more room to adjust slippage if needed.


[01/03/2022 4:17 AM] ltd#2192

[01/03/2022 4:26 AM] j.#6352
It is! It allows you to do multi-step/action transactions in one instead of many. Gas cost is mostly the same, but at least you save on some approvals you dont have to do in each step


[01/03/2022 4:26 AM] j.#6352
Zerion.io is another one that does similar actions but has fewer integrations in DeFi

[01/03/2022 4:39 AM] NerdyBob#3494
if I calculated right it supposed to be around a dollar with 10%(apy) per day

Hello I am new to defi and yearn. I tried depositing into the vault and the deposit got approved but nothing is showing in the account. I have done this multiple times and seem to be paying gas fees for nothing- am I missing a confirmation or an extra step?


[01/03/2022 12:50 PM] j.#6352
Which vault?


[01/03/2022 12:51 PM] RiverHorse#4146
YFI vault


[01/03/2022 12:52 PM] j.#6352
did you deposit ~30 minutes ago?


[01/03/2022 12:53 PM] RiverHorse#4146
Yes, but also last night. The gas fees are showing up in MetaMask but not the actual deposits

Try a hard refresh cntl+shift+r then deposit again. This is a good site for gas estimates https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator

How do I get back to it w/o triggering a whole new transaction? All on mobile

[01/03/2022 1:06 PM] j.#6352
yes


[01/03/2022 1:06 PM] ONI#6888
You need to make the final deposit trx. This will be more expensive than the first one, so you will need eth in your account to cover it.


[01/03/2022 1:07 PM] RiverHorse#4146
On avg how big are vault deposits typically to justify fees?

[01/03/2022 1:08 PM] ONI#6888
it cost someone 48m ago ~50$ in eth to deposit, best to just make sure you have at least 100$ of eth


[01/03/2022 1:10 PM] ONI#6888
Mostly it depends on the the gwei (gas price) at the time of deposit. It seems for now most are 20$ to 50$ but having more eth in the account wouldnt hurt.

"Simulation Error" is our general error message for many things. What are you trying to do? So we can narrow down the next steps

[01/03/2022 1:55 PM] j.#6352

[01/03/2022 1:55 PM] Eyes's#4463
wallet


[01/03/2022 1:56 PM] Eyes's#4463
Curve ibKRW


[01/03/2022 1:57 PM] j.#6352
There's probably no zap route or liquidity enough for your slippage to execute the transaction. I suggest using a different token or swapping TRU for something else first then try again. Stablecoins like MIM or USDC might work better


[01/03/2022 1:57 PM] Eyes's#4463
thank you


[01/03/2022 1:58 PM] j.#6352
you can try swapping TRU for ibKRW on Sushiswap

Hi all, I had $400 worth of wftm in my mm wallet and went to deposit it into a vault however pressed "Approve" by accident. 

I'm now either trying to get it out and move it into a vault but currently yearn is showing me I have $400 dollars available in my wallet but in my MM I don't actually have that value in my MM wallet anymore.


[01/03/2022 5:59 PM] deezy#6819
Feel like I'm either misunderstanding something here or something isn't right. I don't have the option to withdraw, only supply and deposit and when I try and deposit it just says "insufficient funds"in my MM wallet


[01/03/2022 6:01 PM] defiglenn#3350
If you only approved the deposit and didn't click deposit, it should still be in your wallet


[01/03/2022 6:04 PM] defiglenn#3350
I'm baffled too as to why you cant deposit, so all I can suggest is a hard refresh of your browser ctrl + shift + r or shift + f5
, maybe it's a UI error and tomorrow it will work


[01/03/2022 6:11 PM] deezy#6819

Hi all, sorry newb question, been googling for like half an hour now, can't seem to find the best tool to use to monitor how much interest has been accrued from my deposit into a vault (wftm in particular) is yield paid daily and if so is there anywhere I can see/monitor this like I can with tools in beefy?


[01/03/2022 11:30 PM] defiglenn#3350
It will say on the yearn dashboard how much yield is accrued. Yield is paid on harvests every so often, can be hours or weeks, it really depends when it is best for the vault due to gas costs


[01/03/2022 11:31 PM] defiglenn#3350
You can also use the likes of zapper to view your yield


[01/03/2022 11:31 PM] ONI#6888
Trackavault in #🔗links is probably the best for now


[01/03/2022 11:40 PM] ONI#6888
Well it seems they dont have the fantom network yet, it is probably best to manually calculate it for now tbh. We dont have too many tools for the ftm network right now


[01/03/2022 11:40 PM] ONI#6888
You can see yield earned on the `vaults` tab on yearn.finance


[01/03/2022 11:43 PM] ONI#6888
Also if you go here https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdff/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=FTM&var-vaults=yvWFTM+0.4.3&from=now-7d&to=now and set the date at the top to the day you deposited into the wftm vault, you can see under `% share price change` in the category `Assets`, how much yield you have gotten over that time

Hi, I signed up for the yearn finance newsletter on January 1st.
However, I still don't see it on the Galaxy ID page of Project galaxy and cannot get my NFT. 

Could you please check it for me?

Thanks for the reply.

According to the galaxy project blog, the snapshot will be done on Jan 6th 00:00 UTC+8.
I think I need to have NFT CLIME by that time.

Thank you very much for your patience.

I tried to deposit LUSD into the Curve ibEUR vault, approved it and got $15 worth of ETH withdrawn from my wallet. But when I went to deposit, it gave me an error 500. Today when I tried again it is requiring that I approve it again with a new ETH payment. Can anyone help please?


[01/04/2022 2:04 AM] j.#6352
Could be slippage, mostly. Try it directly on Zapper.fi. You can find the Curve ibEUR Yearn Vault under the *Vaults* tab, which is annoyingly hidden under the *More...* tab on the left

you might want to increase it from 3% if you really want to

it might not be worth doing it with $133 though


[01/04/2022 2:16 AM] bedouin#9503
Went up to 5% slippage and still got the same error. I wonder if it's the LUSD token?

maybe you could ask the team?


[01/04/2022 8:04 AM] j.#6352
my answer above comes from looking at the last two harvests from yearn.watch, and gains shown in yearn.vision


[01/04/2022 8:05 AM] j.#6352
yea this is correct


[01/04/2022 8:05 AM] j.#6352
APY for vaults fluctuate from harvests, which is not as regular as emissions from Convex


[01/04/2022 8:06 AM] j.#6352
so there are fewer data points to use


[01/04/2022 8:06 AM] ADone#8725
got it, so means the 73% is probably an outlier and the 26% rather the "truth" of it, do I understand you correctly this way you think?


[01/04/2022 8:06 AM] j.#6352
i wouldnt say "the truth" but more like "closer to"


[01/04/2022 8:07 AM] j.#6352
remember that APY shown is a rolling average over a week

think of it as performance over the recent past

if you want to look at the numbers yourself, you can check the activity on the Convex strategy that's attached to the vault here: https://yearn.watch/network/ethereum/vault/0x67e019bfbd5a67207755D04467D6A70c0B75bF60/strategy/0x214D14f94a63B1714CCc39d12b4942e8Fdd56bA7 and more information on time and amount here https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdff/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-vaults=yvCurve-ibEUR%200.4.3

if you look at the harvest from 12/28, it shows 76%


[01/04/2022 8:09 AM] j.#6352
and there have been lots of deposits since then


[01/04/2022 8:10 AM] j.#6352
but i may be wrong on all of this so i suggest you wait it out

Hi guyz,  do we know the details of the dai vault? It still says "I don't have a description for this strategy yet"


[01/04/2022 9:15 AM] j.#6352
There are several strategies attached to the DAI vault and may not fit in a condensed way in that box. That said, while it could be added in the future, you may want to try looking here: https://yearn.watch/network/ethereum/vault/0xdA816459F1AB5631232FE5e97a05BBBb94970c95

thanks! I supplied 200k mim to ironbank fantom.  I tried to withdraw today, transaction shows as success but nothing happens and I don't get the MIM.  After a few attempts, I tried to withdraw a lower amount (50k) it worked.  Is this due to liquidity issue?


[01/04/2022 1:32 PM] fwanpearonli [Never DM]#2745
I tried to withdraw 50k again, this time it failed

Yes, it’s all lent out. Right now there is a bit less than 11k MIM to withdraw https://ftmscan.com/address/0x46f298d5bb6389ccb6c1366bb0c8a30892ca2f7c#tokentxns

k thanks for confirming. I'm a newbie in lending, didn't realize I'll run into this problem.


[01/04/2022 1:39 PM] ONI#6888
So you have to wait till people pay back what they borrowed before you can withdrawal


[01/04/2022 1:39 PM] fwanpearonli [Never DM]#2745
So, I'll just wait until more mim is supplied and I'll withdraw... (eventually? haha)


[01/04/2022 1:40 PM] ONI#6888
You can watch this graph under utilization and if you click on crMIM it will only show that asset, make sure you have the ftm network selected

[01/04/2022 1:46 PM] ONI#6888
on grafana Overview > Total Cash, tells you how much is free to withdrawal in deposit token terms (not $ amount)


[01/04/2022 1:46 PM] fwanpearonli [Never DM]#2745
I think it will be helpful for the UX to show how much can be withdrawn.  In this case, it is allowing me to choose max and withdraw, transaction also confirmed with no errors.  Kind of confusing.

Hello,  
If I were to put xSushi, yvYFI, yvUSDT and yvUSDC inside a balancer pool.  Would the earned interest go inside the pool itself, or the pool would need to claim the rewards? if so, is that possible?


[01/04/2022 4:44 PM] old_frog_#6669
those tokens dont require harvesting


[01/04/2022 4:44 PM] old_frog_#6669
so you wouldn't need to claim anything


[01/04/2022 4:46 PM] sawine#1337
Nice, so in the case of a balancer managed pool, where the LP token is a ERC-20 that capture the value of the assets inside of it,   its value would raise from the reward I assume?

While everybody is talking about $cvxCRV, $CRV and $CVX, @iearnfinance is buying back #yvBOOST tokens at an incredible pace.

This weeks buyback (which is financed by Curve bribe rewards) was > $700K and all bought back yvBOOST tokens will get distributed back to yvBOOST holders. https://t.co/FKJ4gA5dR1

is yearn taking part in the weekly or bi-weekly bribes on votium in conjunction with crv/cvx? would love to take a look at some documentation or insight from the yearn term if so. maybe you could link me to past proposals or blog posts about it? i havent been in here in a while


[01/04/2022 6:06 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
No votium involved, yearn still have a couple tens millions veCRV that is used to get bribes. All the bribes are used to buyback yvBOOST that is distributed back to yvBOOST vault users

if gas price goes up after you send the tx, you'll have to wait until it goes back down to your set price

[01/07/2022 2:35 PM] jh#7270
repaying a smaller amount seems like it might work


[01/07/2022 2:36 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
which means slippage might be in a weird place


[01/07/2022 2:36 PM] jh#7270

[01/07/2022 2:36 PM] jh#7270
it will let me repay 0.024 it seems


[01/07/2022 2:36 PM] jh#7270
but not 0.0245 or higher


[01/07/2022 2:36 PM] jh#7270
produces the cryptic RPC JSON error


[01/07/2022 2:37 PM] jh#7270
actually seems like 0.0247 is the max it'll allow


[01/07/2022 2:40 PM] jh#7270
why does slippage need to factor in here anyway if the repayment is in the same currency as the debt?


[01/07/2022 2:44 PM] svenmagnus#1415
how do I find out if I ever earned yfi, deposited over a year and a half ago and forgot about it


[01/07/2022 2:45 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Sorry i'm not sure it is slippage. I know it's been a culprit before.


[01/07/2022 2:46 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
using the same wallet, try the legacy site https://v2.yearn.finance/


[01/07/2022 2:49 PM] jh#7270
so I fixed the issue by ensuring that there was more than enough BTC in the wallet before repaying

It means the vault is full

I'm still learning about this so I'm experiencing with low amounts


[01/08/2022 7:27 AM] Crolev#3404
you should first trade this coin for relevant coin first, then deposit it to curve.fi pool and stake those tokens in yearn vault


[01/08/2022 7:27 AM] Crolev#3404
but given that the amount you want to put in is very small you would pay multiple times more for gas than what you own in that position


[01/08/2022 7:29 AM] Crolev#3404
if you want to earn yield on such small amounts then you should look into Argent wallet - it lets you use Yearn vaults on a L2 network at significantly lower transaction cost than Ethereum mainnet


[01/08/2022 7:33 AM] zgomby#6116
Bro thanks


[01/08/2022 7:36 AM] Crolev#3404
you can also look into Fantom


[01/08/2022 7:37 AM] Crolev#3404
the transaction costs there are low too and yields are higher


[01/08/2022 7:38 AM] Crolev#3404
in top right corner of yearn page you can select another network and you can pick Fantom there


[01/08/2022 7:38 AM] zgomby#6116
But how do I transfer this token to Fantom


[01/08/2022 7:38 AM] zgomby#6116
It can't be done, right?


[01/08/2022 7:39 AM] Crolev#3404
theoretically it could be bridged to Fantom, but it would have no liquidity there and gas cost would be too high


[01/08/2022 7:40 AM] Crolev#3404
but you can deposit this token to Bitfinex where it seems to be traded, sell it to get FTM, withdraw FTM to Fantom and then you can trade FTM into a stablecoin like DAI and deposit on Yearn


[01/08/2022 7:56 AM] Acid#4114
WFTM should be listed on the price bot sidebar

Hi I'm working my way through the "Vaults At Yearn" docs but there's some stuff that might need a bit of tidying up


[01/08/2022 7:05 PM] ltd#2192
e.g https://vaults.yearn.finance/ethereum/defi-tokens talks about being able to deposit the assets listed into curve pools, but I don't believe this is true

[01/08/2022 7:05 PM] ltd#2192
It looks more like one deposits the assets directly into Yearn vaults


[01/08/2022 7:20 PM] old_frog_#6669
You can zap directly into yearn vaults, but many of the strategies that rely on curve will have you paying to do that transaction essentially


[01/08/2022 7:21 PM] old_frog_#6669
So your experience is Asset X into yearn vault, but Asset X gets deposited into the curve LP, and then staked into the yearn vault, which is then re-staked into the curve farm


[01/08/2022 7:25 PM] ltd#2192
Nono what I meant was, there's for example no such thing as a curve 1inch pool


[01/08/2022 7:25 PM] ltd#2192
yet it's listed there in the doc


[01/08/2022 7:28 PM] old_frog_#6669
ah interesting


[01/08/2022 7:28 PM] ltd#2192
I think what's happened is, someone's messed up the intro paragraph


[01/08/2022 7:28 PM] ltd#2192
and used the same one for the defi-tokens page as the curve pool page


[01/08/2022 7:28 PM] ltd#2192
so I was super confused for a while


[01/08/2022 7:30 PM] old_frog_#6669
Forsure will pass that along ! thanks for pointing that out


[01/08/2022 7:32 PM] ltd#2192
np, happy to do some editing too if need help with that


[01/08/2022 7:34 PM] ltd#2192
so it seems to me like Yearn's competitive advantage is in its Curve boosting mechanisms (by virtue of having collected a lot of veCRV early on), is that a sustainable strategy on the 10-year horizon? Are there other advantages we can foresee?


[01/08/2022 7:35 PM] old_frog_#6669
We heavily rely on curve boosting mechanisms, but we also have some really great defi strategists that are constantly hunting for the best safe yield, so that helps with our longer term advantage

Another thing: yearn is paying out 20.16% APY on USDC vs Celsius which is paying 8.5% APY on USDC.
- why is there such a big gap between them?
- is the APY on yearn variable?
- is there more risk when staking on yearn vs Celsius?


[01/09/2022 11:43 AM] defiglenn#3350
Lots of clever strategists finding opportunities in DeFi, I think Celsius a centralised provided so they wouldn't have access to same opportunities. Yes APY is variable, so what you see on site is a historical moving weekly average so shouldn't be seen as a guarantee of any future or current returns


[01/09/2022 12:31 PM] visionxyz#1932
I figured that it was variable. Is there a place to view the vAPY as a graph? I ask because i'm trying to figure out an average, ultimately to have enough info to decide where i'm most comfortable staking for long-term earnings.

Hi, I'm hoping you guys can help as I currently think I'm pretty stuck.  I have some yDai that I'd like to exchange for Dai.  It's been a long time since I've been in Yearn.  So I went back to Yearn and its not showing up even though I definitely have it in my metamask wallet.  The vault that I got yDai from seems to be gone as well.  What do I do?


[01/09/2022 8:52 PM] Crolev#3404
How long ago did you deposit? Maybe you deposited to the old v1 vault.
Try going to https://v1.yearn.finance/vaults and check if you can withdraw your funds there.

Looking herehttps://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdff/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=FTM&var-vaults=yvWFTM%200.4.3, strategies *should* harvest daily but the returns are tiny


[01/10/2022 1:48 AM] j.#6352
the most recent one was about two hours ago


[01/10/2022 1:50 AM] terryhoxz#2864
so if i have a small amount in the vault, i most probably get nothing or it doesnt reflect due to the decimal places. 

I only have $50 usd worth of wftm in the vault


[01/10/2022 1:51 AM] terryhoxz#2864
but it has been inside the vault for 1 week and the rewards are still at 0.00


[01/10/2022 1:52 AM] j.#6352

[01/10/2022 4:30 AM] terryhoxz#2864
but i would still receive some earned rewards even if i only have $50 usd worth of wFTM am i right ?


[01/10/2022 4:34 AM] j.#6352
yup


[01/10/2022 7:11 AM] terryhoxz#2864
weird part is it has been in there for about 1 week and the 0.00 has not moved


[01/10/2022 7:27 AM] j.#6352
im guessing the amount of decimals (0.00) is not enough to show any earnings. Try a mock withdrawal and see how much WFTM you get in the simulation. if it's any more than what youve deposited, it contains your earnings if any


[01/10/2022 7:35 AM] terryhoxz#2864
o yes there would be more wFTM credited into my metamask

Hi everybody I need some urgent help… I’ve tried swapping USDC for YFI on Fantom and the network wasn’t working, so I cancelled my transactions and tried depositing USDC into the vault in yearn (on Fantom).. now my USDC is gone from my wallet and it doesn’t appear in the vault


[01/10/2022 12:30 PM] Royski#0114
No USDC and no YFI..


[01/10/2022 12:34 PM] Royski#0114
Was about 18K USDC just gone

It must be somewhere


[01/10/2022 12:40 PM] defiglenn#3350
Are you sure your USDC isn't in the vault? Perhaps you have yveUSDC in your metamask to show this

[01/10/2022 12:42 PM] j.#6352
because this doesnt look like a deposit


[01/10/2022 12:42 PM] Royski#0114
Yes it doesn’t appear on the vault on the yearn webpage


[01/10/2022 12:44 PM] Royski#0114
I tried swapping USDC for YFI on spookyswap and spiritswap multiple times earlier but none of the transactions went through so I tried depositing Usdc into the vault


[01/10/2022 12:44 PM] j.#6352
The contract you used is not of Yearn's


[01/10/2022 12:44 PM] j.#6352
you did this on the Yearn website?


[01/10/2022 12:44 PM] Royski#0114
The vault yes


[01/10/2022 12:45 PM] Royski#0114
The swaps on spooky and spiritswap


[01/10/2022 12:46 PM] Royski#0114
I have no idea what happened I used my bookmarked sites so it wasn’t phishing or anything. FTM wasn’t working properly as multiple transactions failed


[01/10/2022 12:50 PM] Royski#0114
Ok I see now what happened


[01/10/2022 12:50 PM] Royski#0114
I have an open limit order that failed to cancel on Spookyswap


[01/10/2022 12:50 PM] Royski#0114
Funds are safu


[01/10/2022 12:51 PM] Royski#0114
Thank you so so much and sorry for wasting your time! Really appreciate the support


[01/10/2022 12:51 PM] Royski#0114

@Unknown  have you been able to get it fixed


[01/11/2022 3:02 AM] juptier#3258
@FoxTheSin Thanks for getting back :). I had CRV that I wanted to deposit into yveCRV and subsequently yveBOOST. I used the proper site yearn.finance and made sure it was correct when depositing. Once done, the Labs "Holdings" shows a value that is 48% lower than what I deposited. I can DM you the transaction hashs if you like. I faced the same totalsuppliedusdc error others faced but it eventually budged, so maybe something went wrong there?


[01/11/2022 4:21 AM] FlawlessResponse#5610
I have a seemingly similar problem however i have not made any alterations to my vault holdings. My yvBOOST token amount seems to have simply decreased from yesterday by about 25%

Hello, any mod to be able to speak? Yesterday I deposited WTFM and today I do not get the position in the vault, it is as if I had not entered anything and yesterday the entire transaction was confirmed and they removed the WTFM from my wallet, thanks!!


[01/11/2022 7:23 AM] defiglenn#3350
You not got yveWFTM in your metamask? This would be a sort of receipt for your deposit


[01/11/2022 8:52 AM] Arkhan99#0381
Hello!! yes I received more or less half of the WFTMs that I entered in yveWFTM in my metamask, but the yearn.finance vaults do not show my WFTM that I entered yesterday, I should be able to see them right?


[01/11/2022 9:02 AM] defiglenn#3350
Yeah you should that's weird. Have you tried a different browser / hard refresh?


[01/11/2022 9:59 AM] Hrisko#4943
I have similar issue as Arkhan99 and also can not withdraw my funds. It's wFTM on fantom network. When I like to withdraw ist is saying" insufficient funds". Can someone assist please

Did you receive the same number of yveCRV tokens as you had deposited CRV?


[01/11/2022 1:45 PM] juptier#3258
Yes, but I received less yvBOOST when depositing the yveCRV. Is that normal?


[01/11/2022 1:52 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
I'm not %100 on the yveCRV to yvBOOST. Can you DM me the hash of the transaction?

This article will hopefully give you a bit more insight than I can (https://medium.com/iearn/thats-boost-folks-7afae75db826)


[01/11/2022 1:54 PM] j.#6352

Heart 

[01/11/2022 1:58 PM] juptier#3258
Understood, but wouldn't the $ value of the inital CRV I deposited be the $ value of the yvBOOST I have now?


[01/11/2022 1:59 PM] j.#6352
nope


[01/11/2022 1:59 PM] j.#6352
if you watch prices for CRV, yveCRV, and yvBOOST, theyre all different


[01/11/2022 2:00 PM] juptier#3258
So, the fact that I deposited CRV for yveCRV 1:1 means I lost that difference immediately.


[01/11/2022 2:04 PM] j.#6352
sure, yes


[01/11/2022 2:05 PM] j.#6352
if you bought yveCRV or yvBOOST, you would have lost less in USD


[01/11/2022 2:06 PM] juptier#3258
Damn, I obv didn't do enough homework

[01/11/2022 5:10 PM] Joelski40#1530
So if I want to join the yvBoost lab, the best/cheapest method is to just buy yvBoost on sushi and deposit?


[01/11/2022 5:22 PM] Joelski40#1530
Or do I have to buy yveCRV to enter the yvBOOST lab?


[01/11/2022 5:32 PM] defiglenn#3350
I think buying on Sushi works best


[01/11/2022 5:33 PM] Joelski40#1530
Is the APY built into yvBOOST?  So I don’t need to stake it/deposit it anywhere if I buy it on sushi?


[01/11/2022 5:45 PM] Crolev#3404
yes, the way it works is that the ratio of yveCRV underlying yvBOOST grows over time


[01/11/2022 5:53 PM] kobeee#9264
out of curiosity, how does the vault determine when to distribute rewards? Deposited wFTM into the vault and for about a week was getting almost nothing and then all of a sudden, my earnings jumped. Is it random or based on when there are low gas fees or some other factor?

So i deposited DAI to the Vault, where can i find my yvDAI?


[01/11/2022 7:58 PM] Crolev#3404
if you did both transactions (first is approval, second is deposit) then you can view your vault tokens either on the same website you deposited them on or via any online block explorer (i.e. etherscan) or wallet app (i.e. zapper.fi).


[01/11/2022 8:02 PM] Joelski40#1530
Thanks!  Is there any way to track the fees/buybacks going to  yvBoost?


[01/11/2022 8:11 PM] spinx#7212
Thats the problem, i can see yvDAI anywhere?  The deposited DAI is in the vault, but yvDAI is not in the wallet (i have added the token contract manually


[01/11/2022 8:18 PM] Crolev#3404
Try searching for your eth address on etherscan (or ftmscan if you deposited on Fantom) and check the token list there. There should be a position for vault tokens there.


[01/11/2022 11:11 PM] ~bantus-follus#2845
on the wallet tab, when you zap assets into the ironbank as stables, are you later able to recover the original assets? ex. switching 1 UMA for ibGBP, does it work that I still have a right to the 1 UMA later?
also is the APY accurate, says 47% if it switched to ibGBP on that tab but the lend apy on the ironbank tab is .76%


[01/11/2022 11:36 PM] rakesh#0998
Is there any issue with UI?Unable to see token deposited in vaults


[01/11/2022 11:46 PM] old_frog_#6669
@Unknown there shouldn't be, are you connected to the right network? Ctrl + R?


[01/11/2022 11:47 PM] old_frog_#6669
if the price of 1 UMA changes then you will only be able to zap back out to whatever your ibGBP would be worth of UMA


[01/11/2022 11:48 PM] old_frog_#6669
vault APY is different than Ironbank APY


[01/11/2022 11:49 PM] old_frog_#6669

when approving a token for a farm or LP pool are you supposed to allow the token approval amount to be basically infinite for the contract to properly work? Or do you only set it to the amount you're depositing?


[01/12/2022 4:50 AM] defiglenn#3350
Best practice to set it a little over what you are depositing. If you set to infinite it opens up the unlikely possibility of money being withdrawn from your wallet in the future without your permission


[01/12/2022 5:16 AM] SkyDro XIX#3834
See, that's exactly what I've been thinking and have thought to believe from everything I've read, but out of different servers I asked with that same question I got alllllll the different answers EXCEPT this one so it makes it super confusing... all of the servers I've asked this question in are pretty reputable IMO and the general consensus from them is by allowing the unlimited spending you gain more from LP's and Farms and they can only access that specific token you're approving... So my next question would be - does setting the spending limit to around your deposit amount or setting it to infinite effect/change how much you earn or is all the same regardless because of what you initially deposited into it?


[01/12/2022 5:38 AM] defiglenn#3350
No it won't have an effect on what you earn


[01/12/2022 5:40 AM] SkyDro XIX#3834
oof!!! *facepalm* ok thank you for the information!! I'll revoke all the infinite contracts I have then and change them to that limit. I appreciate the help

It's been over a week and I thought it would be done by now, not complaining, just wondering so I can manage myself accordingly. https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdff/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-vaults=yvCurve-ibGBP%200.4.3


[01/12/2022 7:42 AM] SkyDro XIX#3834
got another question.. if you were to revoke the limit entirely after you've deposited into the LP/Farm  does that effect anything?


[01/12/2022 7:48 AM] defiglenn#3350
You would need to approve it again when interacting with the contract i.e withdrawing but it wouldn't affect how much you earn etc


[01/12/2022 7:48 AM] defiglenn#3350
Best advice I can give unfortunately is try again later

[01/12/2022 8:19 AM] Hello_friends#0976
I just deposited into the wFTM vault and it gave me crFTM instead of yvFTM back


[01/12/2022 8:20 AM] Hello_friends#0976
I’ve used this vault before without issues. This is really bizarre


[01/12/2022 8:28 AM] Hello_friends#0976
Withdrew from cream, tried again and it worked. I think there is something buggy with the UI - when I used the shortcut deposit button (little box pops up) for WFTM, it put me through the wrong contract. When I clicked through to the proper (?) vault screen, it worked fine


[01/12/2022 8:33 AM] j.#6352

I have USDC and YFI in vaults on Fantom. For USDC the earned counter goes up, but for YFI it doesn´t. Why is this? And am I missing out on yield on my YFI?

they harvest yield at different rates


[01/12/2022 2:22 PM] old_frog_#6669
usdc is likely much more frequent as more opportunities for yield since its such high demand all the time

So is the APY of 13% incorrect, or is the return simply too lumpy to estimate it correctly?


[01/13/2022 5:19 PM] old_frog_#6669
its sporadic, but as mentioned, the APY is not calculated on a day to day basis


[01/13/2022 5:19 PM] old_frog_#6669
and doesnt pay out as such just on harvests


[01/13/2022 5:21 PM] old_frog_#6669
but viewing the yearn.watch strategies i did not see yield from the current strategy shown


[01/13/2022 5:23 PM] old_frog_#6669
but al;so i think the other strategies just arent reporting accurately in yearn.watch so maybe its higher

I've recently used Yearn for the first time, staking in the wFTM pool. After doing this my staked balance showed, but this has now disappeared. I have taken the yvWFTM and used this as collateral on Abracadabra.Money.....is this why my staked balance isn't showing up?


[01/14/2022 6:34 PM] emiliof#0922
yes. Once you withdraw the yvWFTM from abracadabra back yo your wallet, you will see your balance in yearn again

[01/14/2022 8:02 PM] Jangle#9817
Basically my question is are the rates accurate, and if so how do I calculate my yield? Should my wFTM balance under the "Balance" column be ticking up? 1,010 wFTM  at 13.5% should be ~.35 wFTM per day. So far I've probably only gotten about .01 over a few days


[01/14/2022 8:18 PM] Jangle#9817
Maybe my math is wrong?


[01/14/2022 8:49 PM] old_frog_#6669
your math isnt wrong but thats not how the yearn vaults work


[01/14/2022 8:49 PM] old_frog_#6669
basically the vaults have to harvest from its strategies which can be hours days or weeks at a time

does it still gain the APY even if you cannot see it?


[01/15/2022 12:17 AM] topoescobar#7324
I came for the same question, it makes sense, but if it already shows me profits it means that the harvest has already taken place and the apy does not match at all with what the page shows.


[01/15/2022 12:18 AM] topoescobar#7324
Does anyone know how it is calculated? is it a historical average, or an average of the last 7 days as many protocols do?

Yes


[01/15/2022 2:15 AM] ONI#6888

I'm looking at the Yearn.watch wFTM yVault strategy. How do I determine if this vault has been harvested in the last week? 

https://yearn.watch/network/fantom/vault/0x0dec85e74a92c52b7f708c4b10207d9560cefaf0

My wFTM tokens have only gone up by .2182 in a week which is much lower than 13% APY

[01/15/2022 6:04 AM] Nchan#8949
I also tried zapping to other tokens and they all fail simulation still


[01/15/2022 6:06 AM] j.#6352
*Simulation Failed* is our catchall error for many things. More specific error messages will be added soon. What are you trying to do? Withdraw? Zap in/out?


[01/15/2022 6:07 AM] Nchan#8949
Withdraw out of the steth pool


[01/15/2022 6:07 AM] j.#6352
This could be a slippage and/or liquidity issue from whatever routes Zapper is using


[01/15/2022 6:07 AM] j.#6352
to what token?


[01/15/2022 6:07 AM] Nchan#8949
To crv steth


[01/15/2022 6:07 AM] Nchan#8949
I tried even a tiny amount and it still failed


[01/15/2022 6:08 AM] j.#6352
Do you have enough ETH for gas?


[01/15/2022 6:08 AM] Nchan#8949
Way more


[01/15/2022 6:08 AM] j.#6352
strange


[01/15/2022 6:08 AM] j.#6352
can you show me a screenshot? so i can forward to the web team if needed


[01/15/2022 6:09 AM] j.#6352
a simple withdrawal directly to the underlying token should not be a problem. weird


[01/15/2022 6:09 AM] Nchan#8949
Sure let me screen cap it


[01/15/2022 7:52 AM] Mosk#2260
Hello, I have deposited some "DAI" in YearnFinance in the ironbank part, but the deposit does not come out in yearn but in cream.

Could you help me understand it?


[01/15/2022 7:53 AM] j.#6352
Iron Bank is a Cream product in collaboration with Yearn Finance.

[01/15/2022 10:43 AM] jbw#0001
Having the same issue as Nchan. I’m getting sim failed for every combination of assets and amounts.


[01/15/2022 10:48 AM] j.#6352
try the v2 site for now. v2.yearn.finance/vaults


[01/15/2022 10:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
i have one question. i supply dai on the ironbank. and i borrow wftm on the ironbank. and i go to the valuts and depoits borrowed wftm.

 borrow apy wftm on the ib: 1.5%, deposit apy wftm on the valut: 13%

Despite the apy difference, why does ib loan interest occur more than valut deposit interest?

It's the result of the 2nd try. wftm yfi.


[01/15/2022 10:57 AM] j.#6352
Iron Bank rates are based on usage so it all moves based on the amount of lenders or lent funds, and borrowers or borrowed funds. This dynamic can constantly fluctuate.

Vaults are different. APY is not in *real-time*. See here https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/740414025481060382/930745640173056031


[01/15/2022 11:30 AM] KalCrypto#2028
Here are the screenshots of the same WBTC vault on Fantom where one is showing 7% and other is showing 21%. The one with 7% is what it is showing where my money is in. With a fresh wallet it shows 21%.

I was so excited with 30% apy yesterday, moved my money from polygon and I told my whole village about it and now I look like an idiot. I know APY are dynamic but that is a big drop 😂😂😂


[01/15/2022 11:38 AM] KalCrypto#2028
Thanks! I hope it’s 20% 🙏🏽


[01/15/2022 11:38 AM] jbw#0001

[01/15/2022 12:09 PM] j.#6352
should be correct now. shows ~7%


[01/15/2022 12:11 PM] Michele#3066
Sorry, if this is an old subject, but I'm getting this message when I try to withdraw from the vault. I have $95 worth of ETH in my wallet so would it be an insufficient gas issue? Just curious if anyone has run across this before. Thanks!

[01/15/2022 1:57 PM] j.#6352
in the Settings page, but it only goes up to 3%


[01/15/2022 1:58 PM] j.#6352
two choices: 1. swap your token to something more liquid or direct like a stablecoin, then deposit. 2. use zapper.fi to increase your slippage over 3%


[01/15/2022 1:58 PM] j.#6352
zapper.fi/vaults then just look for the Yearn vault for Curve ibGBP


[01/15/2022 5:22 PM] jbw#0001
Got it, yep. Thanks for following up


[01/15/2022 7:11 PM] Zanetta73#3294
I have a question. I have been staking MIM for a day. He earned $ 1.84 but the value doesn't change and I don't know how to deposit the amounts earned in Balance.


[01/15/2022 7:29 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
It already autocompund if that’s what you asking. Your amount of yvMIM tokens doesn’t change


[01/16/2022 12:25 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
Hi, Im new to yearn and pretty much everything... I have did this by supplying sushi and then i think i borrowed for more...just scared i have NO IDEA how to get out of it and if its a assured loss...

If you want completely out, just click Repay, complete that transaction. then click Withdraw, then complete that transaction.

[01/16/2022 12:33 AM] j.#6352
did you do anything after borrowing 25 SUSHI?


[01/16/2022 12:34 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
first i supplied about 80 SUSHI,


[01/16/2022 12:35 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
Then i clicked the collateral switch


[01/16/2022 12:35 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
then i borrowed safe amount (which was more than 50% i think)


[01/16/2022 12:35 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
then i clicked repay and i lowered the borred total to 25


[01/16/2022 12:36 AM] j.#6352
it looks like you added that 25 to the supply?


[01/16/2022 12:36 AM] j.#6352
since it has 105


[01/16/2022 12:36 AM] j.#6352
did you?


[01/16/2022 12:37 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
well, makes sense...looks like I borrowed  25 SUSHIs right?


[01/16/2022 12:38 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
since i started with like 79


[01/16/2022 12:38 AM] j.#6352
then just reverse everything you did

so it says insufficient collateral


[01/16/2022 12:39 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
obv the interest on doing that vis a vis supply doesnt jive


[01/16/2022 12:39 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
So....what, i have to add a couple in there?


[01/16/2022 12:42 AM] j.#6352
are you not able to withdraw first?


[01/16/2022 12:42 AM] j.#6352
looks like you dont have any sushi in your wallet


[01/16/2022 12:42 AM] j.#6352
withdraw some then repay then withdraw the rest


[01/16/2022 12:47 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
not working


[01/16/2022 2:00 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
OK, so what i did was: 1. supplied +-80 SUSHI
2. switched collateral on


[01/16/2022 2:01 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
3. borrowed against it to borrow 25 SUSHI (I KNOW, THAT WAS DUMB)


[01/16/2022 2:02 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
so...now, how do i get out of this loop? I cant click any repay/or withdraw and i reckon i will be losing the entire amount soon, no?


[01/16/2022 2:05 AM] j.#6352
4. you supplied that 25 SUSHI again right?


[01/16/2022 2:06 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
exactly!


[01/16/2022 2:06 AM] j.#6352

i dont understand why. i see that you have the crSUSHI in your address. it should be a simple withdrawal.

let's just wait to have someone smarter than me get on this


[01/16/2022 2:17 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
ok.  😂


[01/16/2022 2:17 AM] j.#6352
it really should just be withdraw ~25ish SUSHI then repay 25 then withdraw the rest


[01/16/2022 2:18 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152
k


[01/16/2022 2:19 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152

[01/16/2022 2:21 AM] j.#6352
did you already repay?


[01/16/2022 2:22 AM] RicoSwavé  (🧊,🧊)#7152

depends on how it is coded

some have the options to retrieve those tokens, but I believe that opens up other vulnerabilities, so it's questionable if it's possible in this case

so really depends where it was sent to

The APYs that Yearn displays for ibEUR and ibGBP look wrong/impossible.    The APYs for those on Curve itself and as posted on FixedForex here https://fixedforex.live/ are less than 1/2 what's posted on yearn.  What explains this discrepancy?

[01/17/2022 1:14 PM] Cha#6235
correct, I was following what Daniele was mentioning on leveraging your WFTM to earn interest on yearn, and then using the yvWFTM to borrow on Abracadabra to create mim and then staking the mim on yearn, which I thought earned you passive apy on both wftm & mim, but in this case my yvwftm balance has completely dissapeared


[01/17/2022 1:17 PM] Cha#6235
some from the below transaction, 309 WTFM converts to 164 yvWTFM? yvWTFM is worth more than WTFM? I thought the values were equal no? 0x43bc118894547c9c0970fc6908d169f46708e436de5ca4e51f11b1753782e9a6

Hi guys, stupid question maybe. I put ~5k USD in the USDC-EURS vault recently. However, the vault shows $0 invested. In addition, the price did not move in the last days at all. How is this possible / why is this the case? Is this going to change again? Thanks for helping out.


[01/17/2022 1:38 PM] defiglenn#3350
That's weird. If you deposited, it should show up. Are you sure you are on the right network i.e. Fantom or Eth and your wallet is all connected ok? Or perhaps the deposit didn't go through?


[01/17/2022 1:41 PM] charley | jmh.eth#0175
It shows me my balance if I connect my account (and e.g. on zapper). But the vault on the website itself shows 0$ invested.

hi all - is there a tracker for fantom harvests?


[01/17/2022 4:50 PM] defiglenn#3350
Not on discord yet but we are working on it. Let me see if can access on yearn.vision


[01/17/2022 4:53 PM] defiglenn#3350 (pinned)
Check https://yearn.watch/network/fantom . I believe the 'date since last report' is the last time there was a harvest. Then if you click on the strategy name you can see more detail and actually get onto the harvest transaction

Hi, having some issues to withdraw from a vault connecting via walletconnect. It connects fine with Yearn.finance but when I try to withdraw from the vault the transaction never appears. I've been trying to do this for several hours, refreshing constantly the page and disconnecting/connecting the wallet. Is there any issue with this Walletconnect?

Hmm that sounds pretty frustrating. Can you share a screenshot of what you are seeing? Perhaps you  are getting an error and need to delete some of the excess decimals? I'm not sure what to be honest


[01/17/2022 9:33 PM] Poor_Rich#2977
I'm late to say this, but thank you - very helpful!

It seems like the EURS balance is not updating properly as well. Would you mind to have another look?


[01/18/2022 6:21 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
screen shot?
Eurs total balance or your personal balnce in Curve EURS?


[01/18/2022 6:25 PM] charley | jmh.eth#0175
Here you go. It seems that it's not accounting for the EURS value of the vault tokens.

Hi, I have already 200k usd in the vault Curve ibEUR, now i want to add more but if I try with ETH the slippage for 40 eth its like 20 % and for 20 it's 7. Is it better to convert the eth in USDC or other to have less slippage? thanks in advance


[01/19/2022 1:48 AM] j.#6352
best way for that amount would be to go through all of the individual steps yourself


[01/19/2022 1:49 AM] j.#6352
You can swap ETH to MIM, swap MIM to ibEUR on fixedforex.fi/swap, deposit ibEUR in Curve, Deposit in Yearn


[01/19/2022 1:50 AM] j.#6352
You can also try Sushiswap but i think 40 ETH might be too much for the ibEUR liquidity there


[01/19/2022 1:50 AM] FoX#0233
hum seems doable . thank you


[01/19/2022 2:06 AM] FoX#0233

yes they are still a share of the ftm vault


[01/19/2022 9:46 PM] old_frog_#6669
so wen the vault appreciates those tokens are going to also go up


[01/19/2022 9:47 PM] old_frog_#6669
but be careful, dont borrow too much and always have some MIM available to payback incase of sudden down-trends

Any pointers to some formulas I can go look at or something re: the APY shown for a vault vs the rewards I am seeing accumulate in the UI? Specifically looking at the MIM vault on Yearn on Fantom. Expecting 22% ish but seeing what looks like about half of that showing up as rewards in the UI.

Why is this happening? Can admins help pls?


[01/20/2022 6:19 AM] j.#6352
im guessing slippage


[01/20/2022 6:19 AM] dcc84#7047
I set slippage to max (3%)


[01/20/2022 6:20 AM] j.#6352
it might not be enough.*We're working on adding better error messages*


[01/20/2022 6:20 AM] dcc84#7047
So how can I withdraw now?


[01/20/2022 6:20 AM] j.#6352
if you want to try a higher setting, you can go directly to zapper.fi. there, you can adjust your slippage to more than 3%


[01/20/2022 6:21 AM] j.#6352
otherwise, another way is to do the withdrawal step by step: withdraw to underlying Curve USDN LP, withdraw stablecoins from the Curve pool, swap stablecoins to ETH


[01/20/2022 6:21 AM] j.#6352
(if your goal is to get to ETH)


[01/20/2022 6:22 AM] j.#6352
i personally would try the zapper.fi way first because im lazy


[01/20/2022 6:33 AM] dcc84#7047
I will try using Zapper


[01/20/2022 6:42 AM] dcc84#7047
Even at 15% slippage using Zapper transactions are rejected


[01/20/2022 6:44 AM] dcc84#7047
Even at 20% slippage I cannot withdraw


[01/20/2022 6:47 AM] j.#6352
try the long way i described above then


[01/20/2022 6:47 AM] j.#6352
Curve USDN Vault > Curve USDN LP pool > stablecoins > ETH


[01/20/2022 6:55 AM] dcc84#7047
I succeeded in this part Curve USDN Vault > Curve USDN LP Pool


[01/20/2022 6:56 AM] dcc84#7047
Now I can see the crvUSDN tokens in my wallet


[01/20/2022 6:56 AM] dcc84#7047
how to convert to stablecoin?


[01/20/2022 6:56 AM] j.#6352
go to curve, go to the usdn pool, go to the withdraw tab, withdraw to your stablecoin of choice


[01/20/2022 6:57 AM] j.#6352
you can also use zapper.fi for this


[01/20/2022 7:10 AM] dcc84#7047

[01/20/2022 7:10 AM] dcc84#7047

[01/20/2022 10:55 AM] cryptoAslan#8635
is this expected to change at some point? Seems like you can't directly withdraw from any vaults because of this, lot of expensive transactions to do them all individually

If you deposit YFI and stake it as hYFI to hundred finance.....will you not be eligible for the new changes to the YFI tokenomics ?


[01/20/2022 12:52 PM] svtmd1#0341
I imagine you can only receive yearn protocol fees by staking in Yearn  or will the YFI $ automatically accrue to the token like with an LP? Also if there is a new "YFI lock/stake" option on Yearn- will it be available on fantom too?


[01/20/2022 12:54 PM] j.#6352
Short answer: no one knows
Long answer: no one knows, and naked YFI wont get this because veYFI involves locking YFI, and xYFI involves a different token, whichever is decided on being implemented. Please see the entire description in the Snapshot YIP-65.


[01/20/2022 1:09 PM] svtmd1#0341

[01/20/2022 2:34 PM] defiglenn#3350
That's weird, it's working fine for me. I'd recommend trying a different browser/ a hard refresh ctrl + shift + r or shift + f5
, or just waiting. Fantom seems to be playing up right now


[01/20/2022 2:40 PM] Jux#8438
Thanks for the response. Maybe it is just Fantom not responding then. Don't really want to install metamask on another browser just for this.


[01/20/2022 2:45 PM] Jux#8438
I just realised it is only happening for AVAX (which has supply greyed out but deposit enabled). Works fine for ETH.

[01/21/2022 9:14 AM] defiglenn#3350
what one are you looking for? I can get it for you. On the vault page of the asset you are depositing you can click the ethersscan logo to go to the contract page, and the address is at the top

[01/21/2022 9:32 AM] blibby#1998
nm...was using wrong contract code, got the right now, but the deposit token value is less than the stablecoin i deposited, why?


[01/21/2022 10:33 AM] ONI#6888
because yield is harvested and added to the pool of funds which increases share price. Thus the higher share price you join the less vault tokens you get. its starts out 1:1 so 100 dai would give you 100 yvDAI. But as it harvests and gets yield later it might have gained 5% so that would be a share price of 1.05. so 100 dai would get you 95.23 yvDAI.


[01/21/2022 11:06 AM] Linda2024#9260
on Ethereum, i cannot deposit ETH into vault. in v2 it says Zap Failed. This means there is not enough liquidity for this token or Zapper may be down. Try with DAI, ETH, USDC or USDT as they offer the more liquidity.


[01/21/2022 11:10 AM] Crolev#3404
Which vault are you trying to deposit to?
If zap fails then you might want to first swap your tokens for the appropriate one for the vault.

[01/21/2022 11:13 AM] Crolev#3404
Try wrapping your ETH into WETH first. You can do that on uniswap.


[01/21/2022 11:13 AM] blibby#1998
so if i have ~94% of yvDAI of my DAI position, you would expect that ratio to grow over time?


[01/21/2022 11:15 AM] Linda2024#9260
in beta version, i see this error when depositing eth into eth vault "gasPrice=0&slippagePercentage=0.01&api_key=96e0cc51-a62e-42ca-acee-910ea7d2a241&skipGasEstimate=false request failed (status 500 Internal Server Error)


[01/21/2022 11:19 AM] Crolev#3404
That seems like a failed API request. Try using the normal yearn website: https://yearn.finance/vaults/ and depositing WETH rather than ETH to skip using zapper.

Hello,


[01/21/2022 11:25 AM] Crude#4548
I have transfered some ftm to my MM wallet, I see it there, but when I connect the wallet to yearn it says zero balance.  I can see the FTM on ftmscan.


[01/21/2022 11:26 AM] ONI#6888
Yes it will grow over time that is how the vaults work, basically you dont need to worry about how many yvTokens you have


[01/21/2022 11:26 AM] ONI#6888
dont use the beta anymore use yearn.finance


[01/21/2022 11:28 AM] ONI#6888
you need to have wftm to deposit into the wftm vault as that is the base asset. Please make sure to wrap it. You can do so on spookyswap or via fantoms wallet


[01/21/2022 11:29 AM] Crude#4548

[01/21/2022 2:01 PM] Crolev#3404
Try withdrawing to the token native to the vault you want to withdraw from. Seems that there's something wrong with zapper today.


[01/21/2022 2:01 PM] Crolev#3404
Which vault are you trying to withdraw from?


[01/21/2022 2:01 PM] HoCo#8880

hey im still having a lot of trouble with this. i tried every alternative rpc, raised gas, and waited + tried every few hours for the past day but still kept getting the same internal json rpc error. what's interesting is that i dont get this error on any other protocol on fantom - it's only yearn/iron bank. is there anything else i can try? i've never encountered an issue like this before


[01/21/2022 4:07 PM] defiglenn#3350
That sounds frustrating. We've had this a fair bit lately. Trying again later seems to be a good cure, otherwise a different browser may work


[01/21/2022 4:18 PM] 0xFables#7834
thanks for trying to help. is this an issue yearn can look into on their end? or are you completely at the mercy of the network rn


[01/21/2022 4:20 PM] defiglenn#3350
yeah Fantom seems to be playing up. I'm surprised you are finding it just with Yearn, so that's useful feedback so will pass this on

also make sure you are at least using rpc.ftm.tools as your rpc, though it also has been acting up lately


[01/21/2022 4:36 PM] kx9x#3778

Hi, I'm unable to withdraw from my Curv stETH vault, it shows the correct amount but stucked at "simulating" !  I tried someone's suggestion of reducing the decimal and I did, still no job.  Any help appreciated, thx

hi, how do i add yearn finance to metamask pls


[01/22/2022 3:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
1. Open metamask and click Assets to see tokens in your wallet
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click add token
3. Click custom token
4. Paste the contract address for yUSD into the token contract address field
5. Click edit to change the token symbol
6. Type in yUSD and click next
7. You can see your balance of yUSD. Click add tokens to finish up
8. You are done. You'll now see yUSD in your assets list so it's easier to track and use.

Hi. Does YFI work in other chains (not ETH and FTM) like said on cmc? I see there are working contracts, but no info on official website. 
I'd like to use YFI on AVAX. How should i do that?

I deposited Yearn Vault Curve stETH tokens in abracadabra.money, I recently closed my position after 83 days & when I came back to the yearn vault said I had earned $0.63 on over 40k deposited


[01/22/2022 4:35 PM] kx9x#3778
yearn doesn't track your earnings when you don't own the tokens


[01/22/2022 4:35 PM] kx9x#3778
your tokens were in the abra cauldron


[01/22/2022 4:35 PM] kx9x#3778
so yearn cannot possibly know how much you made while in there


[01/22/2022 4:35 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
How does it keep track rebasing?


[01/22/2022 4:36 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
Cuz otherwise I wasted hundreds of dollars in gas


[01/22/2022 4:37 PM] kx9x#3778
rebasing?


[01/22/2022 4:37 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
The value of the token increasing as interest is accumulated?


[01/22/2022 4:37 PM] kx9x#3778
that's not what rebasing means


[01/22/2022 4:38 PM] kx9x#3778
yearn calculates that as price per share, you had X amount of vault tokens which are worth some ratio to real crvSTETH


[01/22/2022 4:38 PM] kx9x#3778
so now you can withdraw more crvsteth than you deposited


[01/22/2022 4:38 PM] kx9x#3778
no rebasing involved at all


[01/22/2022 4:38 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
Ahh I’ll check the etherscan


[01/22/2022 5:01 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
I deposited ~11.73 steCRV for 10.90 yvCurve-stETH, I just pulled out 16.25 steCRV from yearn vault on Ethereum


[01/22/2022 5:02 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
That’s 27.82%


[01/22/2022 5:03 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
Is this right?


[01/22/2022 5:10 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
Annualized that’s 122.32% according to my smooth brained math


[01/22/2022 5:19 PM] Amphibian_Warlock#2743
?


[01/22/2022 5:31 PM] kx9x#3778
I don't think that is possible since the price per share is just 1.07669


[01/22/2022 5:31 PM] kx9x#3778
meaning it has yielded 7.6% since inception


[01/22/2022 5:31 PM] kx9x#3778
you probably deposited multiple times


[01/22/2022 5:31 PM] kx9x#3778
and you did


[01/22/2022 5:32 PM] kx9x#3778

[01/23/2022 7:43 AM] SB#3547
WETH is not listed, manually adding the address doesn't work


[01/23/2022 7:44 AM] SB#3547
Withdrawing to CrvStETH (i.e. just removing from vault) seems to trigger the TX, but would like to avoid this step. Withdrawing to ETH, DAI, ... returns error


[01/23/2022 7:48 AM] Crolev#3404
Unfortunately it seems that you will have to withdraw to crvStETH directly since Zapper API seems to be down. You can also wait until someone fixes it, but it's Sunday so it might take a while.

can't use my ust as collateral either, but it says under markets that $4.6 mil ust is being borrowed. so you can borrow it but you can't use it as collateral. sux


[01/23/2022 6:15 PM] Crolev#3404
Try withdrawing the token native to the vault (i.e. WETH for ETH vault, DAI for DAI vault, etc). 
Do not DM the person above. It's the first message of that person on this server which is highly suspicious.

That's not ideal. Are you sure you did enough gas? If it's Fantom, the network is playing up so waiting maybe best option

since the yearn website only allows 1 2 3%


[01/24/2022 10:23 AM] j.#6352
on zapper.fi you can adjust this to anything

edit: checking


[01/24/2022 10:25 AM] SB#3547
Funny, that seems to work. What I've noticed is that Yearn and Zapper are showing a different amount of CrvStEth available in vault


[01/24/2022 10:26 AM] SB#3547
both result in the same amount of Eth though


[01/24/2022 10:28 AM] defiglenn#3350
I think the APY of 43 is based on the recent harvest annualised, whereas the one of 19 is a weekly moving average of the past year (sorry for the confusion)


[01/24/2022 10:48 AM] Matoshi#8498

I'm so sorry for you dude.
This transaction wasn't initiated by you, but rather the 0x14cab1 address who it seems has (unfortunately) stole funds from you by using the recent Anyswap/Multichain exploit (completely unrelated to Yearn).
The transaction was bid for by bots on Flashbots and you can find it in Flashbots explorer:
https://flashbots-explorer.marto.lol/?block=14068447 (also screenshot)

239 eth was bid to the miners as a bribe while exploiter got 11 eth out of this. 
You should go to Anyswap/Multichain telegram group and try to ask there (beware the scammers who will DM you first though) and file a ticket on Multichain zendesk.

[01/24/2022 12:49 PM] Crolev#3404
Yes, it seems that there is a big mess with it on Anyswap telegram, because there is a lot of people affected


[01/24/2022 12:51 PM] Crolev#3404
@mumblealtos remember to revoke your other permissions to Anyswap to make sure nothing else gets stolen.


[01/24/2022 12:52 PM] kx9x#3778

if you're on ETH network unless you're working with large sums it is often not worth withdrawing in shorter time frames due to gas fees

Hey guys, this is a suggestion for the Yearn UI. When viewing our deposits in the Vaults section, would it be possible to view our Earned assets in its native unit. For example if I earned $100 in BTC in the WBTC vault, I would like to know how much BTC units were earned.

i'm using ledger nano s. my balance weth is 0 and simulation failed
is it safe to make this transfer?


[01/24/2022 4:11 PM] Crolev#3404
The balance being 0 is normal if you don't have WETH yet on your address. It's weird that you get the simulation failed error since that's native token for the vault - could you please share a screenshot of it?


[01/24/2022 4:11 PM] kx9x#3778
Do you have enough eth to pay for the transaction


[01/24/2022 4:11 PM] kx9x#3778
That is a common cause of simulation failure


[01/24/2022 4:12 PM] AndrzejB#6373
transaction fee has been taken two days ago since i'm fighting with this


[01/24/2022 4:16 PM] Crolev#3404
It doesn't matter for the future transactions whether a fee was taken for a failed transaction in the past - they are separate.
Do you have at least 0.2 ETH on your wallet to which you are trying to withdraw your funds? If you have less than that then you might not have enough to pay for the transaction.


[01/24/2022 4:17 PM] AndrzejB#6373

Unfortunately i don't have enough funds to pay fee

double check how much gas it costs to withdraw when it pops up metamask


[01/24/2022 4:24 PM] Crolev#3404
Also the gas fees right now are relatively high: https://etherscan.io/gastracker
So if you don't have enough ETH to make a transaction right now then you can check later when gas price goes down and maybe then you will have enough.

[01/25/2022 11:23 AM] MEHDI#1111
are they suppose to be the same ?


[01/25/2022 11:24 AM] Crolev#3404
IIRC the wallet APY is based on previous 30 days while vault APY is based on the most recent harvest for each strategy


[01/25/2022 11:25 AM] Crolev#3404
I would say both are incorrect in their own way


[01/25/2022 11:25 AM] Crolev#3404
as it's difficult to say what will the future APY be like


[01/25/2022 11:27 AM] MEHDI#1111

[01/25/2022 12:22 PM] j.#6352
No. One of Yearn's goals with vaults is that you at the very least *should* be able to get back the amount deposited

hmmm 2 mins and counting, common for it to take this long just to approve?

any issue here or should i have wrapped it again


[01/25/2022 12:42 PM] BitBae#5497
ah its just been approved


[01/25/2022 1:16 PM] jh#7270
Can this be fixed please? It's quite annoying to have a debt of 10,000 but to need 10,100 in the wallet in order to repay the debt. It means if you borrow X of a token and then want to pay it back straight away you actually have to go and buy more of it in order to repay.


[01/25/2022 1:17 PM] jh#7270
Otherwise it produces "INTERNAL JSON-RPC ERROR."


[01/25/2022 1:18 PM] j.#6352
because of interest every block


[01/25/2022 1:19 PM] jh#7270
no


[01/25/2022 1:19 PM] jh#7270
I'm talking about where the debt is 10,000 originally, and goes up to maybe 10,002


[01/25/2022 1:20 PM] jh#7270
and I have 10,003 in my wallet and want to pay the whole debt back


[01/25/2022 1:20 PM] jh#7270
and it won't let me pay back more than 9900


[01/25/2022 1:20 PM] jh#7270
until I add another 100 of the token into the wallet


[01/25/2022 1:20 PM] jh#7270
then it'll let me pay back 10,002


[01/25/2022 1:20 PM] jh#7270
and now I still have 100 extra tokens that I didn't want


[01/25/2022 1:21 PM] jh#7270
had the problem with WBTC before, now with DAI


[01/25/2022 1:23 PM] jh#7270
it seems there's something that stops you paying back using more than 99% of the tokens in your wallet


[01/25/2022 1:47 PM] Mike | UpwardSpiral#8310
I approved USDC successfully twice on Fantom but I still can't deposit in the vault. I just get stuck in a loop of having to approve again.


[01/25/2022 1:47 PM] jh#7270
yeah actually I think there's some code that treats repayments above 99% of the debt differently:
```
 const repay = async () => {
    try {
      if (willRepayAll) {
        await dispatchAndUnwrap(
          IronBankActions.repayAllMarket({
            marketAddress: selectedMarket.address,
          })
        );
      } else {
        await dispatchAndUnwrap(
          IronBankActions.repayMarket({
            marketAddress: selectedMarket.address,
            amount: toBN(amount),
          })
        );
      }
      setTxCompleted(true);
    } catch (error) {}
  };
```


[01/25/2022 1:47 PM] jh#7270
where
```
  const willRepayAll = toBN(percentageToRepay).gte(99);
```

ok .2 works


[01/25/2022 1:57 PM] Mike | UpwardSpiral#8310
Got it to work after a 3rd approval. Not sure what happened. May have been some network issues.


[01/25/2022 2:04 PM] jh#7270
it seems somehow when `repayAllMarket` is used from `src/core/store/modules/ironBank/ironBank.actions.ts` that this is causing the RPC error in the cases above.  It's unclear why >99% would count as repaying all here


[01/25/2022 2:08 PM] jh#7270
in `src/core/services/IronBankService.ts`  you can see that `executeTransaction` has different logic triggered by the repayAll case


[01/25/2022 2:08 PM] jh#7270
in particular it triggers this block:
```
if (amount === MAX_UINT256) {
          const balanceOf = await ironBankMarketContract.balanceOf(userAddress);
          return await this.transactionService.execute({
            network,
            methodName: 'redeem',
            abi: ironBankMarketAbi,
            contractAddress: marketAddress,
            args: [balanceOf.toString()],
          });
        } 
```


[01/25/2022 2:09 PM] jh#7270
which seems to be saying that it tries to repay all the user's balance, even if the user doesn't have this amount


[01/25/2022 2:20 PM] esteban_torringer#8569
Could anyone better explain the 20% performance fee that is deducted every time a vault harvests a strategy? I am having a hard time determining exactly what a "vault harvesting a strategy" consists of and how frequently it occurs.


[01/25/2022 2:24 PM] Poid#9335
Similar issue on my end


[01/25/2022 2:37 PM] jh#7270
so I think the issue here is if the user has less than the full debt + interest in the wallet, but more than 99%, and tries to pay back a fraction 0.99 < x < 1 of the debt, the call to `redeem` will be triggered for exactly 100% of the debt, which may exceed what the user has in the wallet


[01/25/2022 2:37 PM] jh#7270
I think this is just a bug in the logic


[01/25/2022 2:39 PM] jh#7270
`repayAllMarket` should only be used if the user wallet balance is more than the total debt, and there's also no reason to assume that someone trying to pay back 99.5% of the debt actually intends to try to pay back all of it


[01/25/2022 2:40 PM] jh#7270
if you hit the MAX button and happen to have a few cents less than the full debt amount in your wallet, you probably just want to pay back 99.99%


[01/25/2022 2:50 PM] Poid#9335
Anyone else have this issue on FTM ? (MetaMask)

So whenever profit is made on a strategy, 20% of it is taken to pay the Yearn team. You can check how often harvests occur on the #🌽mainnet-harvest channel


[01/25/2022 3:13 PM] defiglenn#3350
Maybe network taking a while. Did you follow this when you connected your wallet to Fantom? https://twitter.com/fantomfdn/status/1432824921613340680?lang=en

what is this APY?


[01/25/2022 3:14 PM] octaviang#7889
i have 2 positions in vaults, WBTC for 54,18% APY and MIM for 47.14% APY


[01/25/2022 3:15 PM] octaviang#7889
i understand that since oxdao reduced the farming of these tokens to 0 the APYs are not accurate at all


[01/25/2022 3:15 PM] octaviang#7889
so the 13.12% APY is the real APY for the deposit?


[01/25/2022 3:19 PM] kx9x#3778
hey, I am trying to get folks to look at this, but it would be immensely helpful to summarize things concisely in a github issue here: https://github.com/yearn/yearn-finance-v3/issues


[01/25/2022 3:22 PM] c1#3389
hei guys, im trying to deposit yFTM, but when it gets to APPROVAL, i always get fail transaction. i already up my gwei to 4500, yet still fail. whats wrong?


[01/25/2022 3:24 PM] defiglenn#3350
One of them is a weekly moving average from past year, think the 13.12. The other one is the most recent harvest annualised, so it's a lot higher. Both of these give no guarantees of current or future returns


[01/25/2022 3:25 PM] defiglenn#3350
What error are you getting? It may be that vault is full


[01/25/2022 3:26 PM] kx9x#3778
wftm isn't full so it must be something else. probably user error.


[01/25/2022 3:27 PM] c1#3389
strange. metamask says FAILED, but now i check/refresh yearn app, its been approved


[01/25/2022 3:27 PM] esteban_torringer#8569
I see, thank you. I am looking at the harvest page right now, out of curiosity is there an average number of harvests that occur on a given vault per quarter?


[01/25/2022 3:35 PM] Mike | UpwardSpiral#8310
Ah yeah I was using that one, thanks. Yeah probably network delays.


[01/25/2022 3:37 PM] octaviang#7889

[01/25/2022 4:43 PM] ONI#6888
scream.sh isnt yearn.finance


[01/25/2022 4:44 PM] muhan#0958
I understand that, but the yearn ftm vault uses scream.sh as it's strategy. so to get a better idea of expected apr, i'd like to know what the scream apr for ftm is...


[01/25/2022 4:44 PM] muhan#0958
Strategies
Supplies WFTM to Iron Bank or Scream whichever has the best yield to generate interest. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more WFTM, then deposited back into the strategy.


[01/25/2022 4:45 PM] muhan#0958
so can anyone help out and just tell me what screams ftm apr is? I can't see it as my country is geoblocked from accessing scream

Hello everyone! New here, and I hoped someone can help: I deposited 40 WFTM in the vault, and received only 21 yvWFTM. Am I missing something? I thought I would get the same amount of WFTM as yvWFTM in my wallet


[01/25/2022 5:43 PM] ONI#6888
You dont get the same amount, its based off share price


[01/25/2022 5:44 PM] ONI#6888
share price is 1.886908150141785451

[01/25/2022 5:50 PM] ONI#6888
FTM apy has dropped since the juicy farms have ended sadly


[01/25/2022 6:08 PM] ONI#6888
9%


[01/25/2022 6:16 PM] Crolev#3404
Isn't the dashboard APY 30 day average while vault APY is based on the most recent harvest?
Both seem rather wrong - on yearn.watch the most recent harvests are at like 4-5% APR.


[01/25/2022 6:24 PM] ONI#6888
This is the most accurate at this moment


[01/25/2022 6:25 PM] ONI#6888

[01/25/2022 7:11 PM] Sterling#6796
any admin on that can answer me? (please stop DMing me, you're wasting your time)


[01/25/2022 7:17 PM] Crolev#3404
unfortunately that's problem with Fantom right now - you just need to keep trying until it works
you will see that it worked when you receive vault tokens - you can check for it either on ftmscan or on the same page you are making the deposit

[01/25/2022 7:31 PM] defiglenn#3350
That's based on last harvest , which was particularly high due to 0xdao strategy which has now ended. It's now going to be a lot lower going forward, even the 16% only an estimate

[01/25/2022 8:06 PM] defiglenn#3350
Try removing some of the decimals at the end


[01/25/2022 8:08 PM] john_dewitte#8042
Ok that works. I just need to sign the withdraw tx or is there another tx I need to sign?


[01/25/2022 8:35 PM] old_frog_#6669
likely need to approve with 1 tx and withdraw with another

[01/25/2022 8:40 PM] old_frog_#6669
@Androc01 that is the same vault


[01/25/2022 8:41 PM] old_frog_#6669
are you sure you deposited? It takes 2 transactions, an approval and a deposite. Double check your transactions. The vault APY has been updated as the recent strategies with 0xDAO and veDAO have ended so APYs will come back down


[01/25/2022 8:42 PM] Androc01#4538
@old_frog_ Yes got my yvwftm and used that for collateral on abra for MIM


[01/25/2022 8:43 PM] defiglenn#3350
It won't show up in your wallet because you used it as collateral on Abra. Don't worry though you are still earning on it, so can realise this return when you withdraw from abra

Hey i deposited 47k worth of crypto but my borrow limit is stuck at 24k and 62%


[01/26/2022 11:23 AM] defiglenn#3350
That's because liquidation risk would be higher if you were allowed to borrow more

There is something wrong with IronBank. I enabled the collateral toggle but it doesnt show..

[01/26/2022 2:03 PM] j.#6352
i have no idea what that means. sorry. are you using your hardware wallet with metamask or just the hardware wallet directly?


[01/26/2022 2:04 PM] oneconfirmation#5092
hardware wallet directly


[01/26/2022 2:04 PM] j.#6352
try interfacing with metamask

[01/26/2022 2:08 PM] oneconfirmation#5092
that didn't work either with metamask


[01/26/2022 2:09 PM] j.#6352
try 1inch if there's still some liquidity somewhere


[01/26/2022 2:10 PM] j.#6352
or curve.fi/y


[01/26/2022 2:11 PM] j.#6352
not sure if curve can unwrap yUSDC to to USDC. if not, and this can get very expensive, deposit yUSDC in the curve pool then withdraw USDC


[01/26/2022 2:12 PM] oneconfirmation#5092
alright i used firefox with metamask and the gas fee control popped up on v1.yearn site


[01/26/2022 2:12 PM] oneconfirmation#5092
i'll wait for gas to be lower and do the claim.


[01/26/2022 2:13 PM] oneconfirmation#5092
after claiming the yUSDC where can i swap yusdc or migrated to yearn v3 ?


[01/26/2022 2:13 PM] j.#6352
withdrawing from yUSDC Earn will give you back USDC


[01/26/2022 2:13 PM] j.#6352
so just deposit to the USDC vault on yearn.finance


[01/26/2022 2:14 PM] oneconfirmation#5092
so claiming the yusdc will automatically convert that to usdc ?

The textual message I'm seeing on the yfi website when retrying is:

Hi, I deposited some wFTM in the vault and went to abracadabra to lend some MIM with the yvWFTM. I deposited the MIM also in a vault. But now I can't see my wFTM vault anymore. Is this because all the yvWFTM is deposited inabracadabra?

from any wallet or just trust wallet

from metamask you just click the 3 dots and then this button, look for yearn and disconnect wallet

Eth gas fees are very high


[01/26/2022 11:35 PM] arberx#3367
And the deposit transaction is complex


[01/26/2022 11:35 PM] arberx#3367
Best bet is to just leave it in there now long term

again, if eth fees get significantly cheaper in the next couple months, you can test out to see what a withdraw will cost


[01/26/2022 11:49 PM] kx9x#3778
Explain? Ethereum runs a fee market where you have to pay more to get your tx submitted. Ethereum has failed to scale for like 6 years now, so the price is extremely expensive for any sort of transaction. All complaints should be directed to the Ethereum foundation on the lack of scale

Hello all! I have been farming WBTC and WETH on Fantom Yearn vaults! Since the boosted APY's ended (for the Solidly TVL snapshots) the website or other DeFi dashboards do not show any incoming yield anymore.


[01/27/2022 10:40 AM] Crolev#3404
They still do, it's just that now the yield is much lower and it takes a while to see it grow.


[01/27/2022 10:40 AM] 0xGengar#9384
The strategy shows that it is utilizing Scream.sh to borrow and redeposit


[01/27/2022 10:41 AM] 0xGengar#9384
Any chance the Scream.sh side is overborrowed and the strategy cannot exit to sell the farmed tokens?

go to connextscan.io then enter your address in the search bar on the top right


[01/27/2022 11:43 AM] j.#6352
this is to show the bridging that happened


[01/27/2022 11:44 AM] j.#6352
then, check your address on etherscan


[01/27/2022 11:45 AM] j.#6352
you'll see the transfer to another address


[01/27/2022 11:46 AM] j.#6352
then if you check that address, you'll see another address which had a transaction with Binance. so you might be able to follow this by asking them if you want to


[01/27/2022 11:46 AM] j.#6352
assuming that the two addresses following your address from the above process are not yours

sorry if dumb question


[01/27/2022 12:11 PM] jcgravvity#1320
it didn't seem to work at first, so i got rid of all the decimals and hit refresh a couple of times and eventually it just worked


[01/27/2022 12:11 PM] weeper#2138
am trying this as well but keep getting failed tx maybe ill wait a bit


[01/27/2022 12:13 PM] weeper#2138
got it to work thanks lads


[01/27/2022 12:15 PM] j.#6352
me being lazy, i actually never had to change my RPC URL. so you probably dont have to. any Fantom issues ive had were always resolved by waiting and trying over and over


[01/27/2022 12:16 PM] j.#6352
but in case youre still interested, on metamask, go to Settings, Advanced, Networks, Fantom, then edit the RPC URL there to something else you want to try


[01/27/2022 12:18 PM] weeper#2138
yeah thats what I ended up doing and dropped some decimals

[01/27/2022 1:57 PM] kx9x#3778
strategies "borrow" money from the vault and debt ratio means how much % of vault money is going into a strategy. it has nothing to do with like actual debt


[01/27/2022 1:58 PM] kx9x#3778
it is just terminology


[01/27/2022 2:01 PM] grant#3690
Gotcha, thanks. In that case though, the actual debt ratio in my 1st pic would actually be 100% as opposed to the stated 50%, correct?


[01/27/2022 2:02 PM] grant#3690
Because the total debt matches the estimated assets


[01/27/2022 2:02 PM] ONI#6888

[01/27/2022 2:03 PM] ONI#6888
Also if you see in the top left corner there is a description on most fields


[01/27/2022 2:03 PM] ONI#6888
which vault?


[01/27/2022 2:04 PM] kx9x#3778
that is one strategy, so its total assets/debt will be the same unless there is a loss or it didn't report a credit to the vault yet-- then it might have more assets than debt.


[01/27/2022 2:04 PM] kx9x#3778
look at the vault page to see total assets, it should be about double what you see on that 50% strat, I believe


[01/27/2022 2:05 PM] grant#3690
Ok let me go find that vault again, I realize my screenshot cropped out the name


[01/27/2022 2:06 PM] kx9x#3778
unless the vault isn't fully utilized or the strategy is 50% debt but it hasn't been fully filled yet


[01/27/2022 2:14 PM] grant#3690
Yes, you're right. That vault, SUSHI v0.4.3, is splitting it's assets 50/50 between 2 strats

The strategist is someone who writes a strategy in standard compatible with vault for a given token - it's usually a fork of this repo: https://github.com/yearn/brownie-strategy-mix
Read this thread to find out more about the research and approval pipeline for strategies: https://twitter.com/flashfish0x/status/1460246273488044036
Strategists do not do the harvests themselves - it is done through Keep3r protocol by bots.

Why are you asking? Do you want to become a strategist?

[01/27/2022 5:04 PM] Henri#2328
What Yearn.watch is showing me is the correct value, so whatever the API from Yearn.watch is giving me is off by around 650k

So somewhere that number has to be reduced and I haven't found the calculations for that yet

are you asking because you are looking for a api to query this info from or? I will ask about why the subgraph doesnt seem to be up to date though


[01/27/2022 5:11 PM] bfs#7030
the problem is the subgraph

【Please tell me 】
I have two questions.
1. At what point does the Yearn Finance strategy switch?
Or will new ones be added and gradually become more prevalent?
If you have a link, please let me know. .
2. What is the process for determining the strategy?
I understood the process for governance in this source but I can’t find some sources how to determine vault’s strategies

I believe you can zap into the wBTC vault with any other assets


[01/28/2022 12:58 AM] old_frog_#6669
but it will be converted to wBTC and accrue yield as wBTC


[01/28/2022 12:58 AM] yahtzeefish#9367
Not sure what this means... zap into? What if I have renBTC on Ethereum?

Should say on yearn.finance how much you've earned


[01/28/2022 8:54 AM] Moldunko#2031
nothing since Yearn's APY are deceptive / rarely updated 🙃 
DAI and USDC's ones have been the same for several days when in fact, you earn nothing 👍

[01/28/2022 8:55 AM] ONI#6888
This isnt how vaults work some can take up to two weeks to harvest, you can view these stats and how much share price has increased at yearn.vision


[01/28/2022 9:06 AM] Moldunko#2031
how can it take so long to harvest despite your TVL? It's way higher than other competitors and they harvest more frequently with the same assets (mine were stablecoins + BTC + ETH = 4 different vaults on Fantom) 🤔 
so will the current APY still be valid after 2 weeks? Because if it's not the case, you may miss other opportunities


[01/28/2022 9:07 AM] ONI#6888
depends on the vault we have probably over 50


[01/28/2022 9:09 AM] Moldunko#2031
well meanwhile I've also seen the message quoted in the strategies channel: a bit confusing to have monthly APY when you're used to ones that are updated hourly
but W&S for the new system: thank you for your answers


[01/28/2022 9:10 AM] ONI#6888
it just depends really you can have all of those the question is which is accurate or most accurate? generally 1m and 1w show you good past estimates and 1d is good now estimates, the probably with 1d is vaults will be at 0 apy for some days till they harvest because they have not enough farmed tokens to make harvest profitable yet (some vaults).


[01/28/2022 9:10 AM] ONI#6888
you can look at these stats at yearn.vision if you want to check it out


[01/28/2022 9:15 AM] Moldunko#2031
I understand your point of view: didn't expect such difference in time frame though


[01/28/2022 9:19 AM] ONI#6888
so if a vault harvest every week, then on 1 day apy for 6 days it will show 0 and 1 day it will be up really high, longer time frames help even this out, but that is just how the vaults work. with multiple strategies.

[01/28/2022 9:20 AM] ONI#6888
Also if you see the pinned msg here it links to a message elsewhere that says web team is working to improve apy's on the site and how they are displayed so its def something we are looking into


[01/28/2022 9:21 AM] Moldunko#2031
yes, I've seen this part, thank you


[01/28/2022 11:51 AM] tche#3831
Hello, I'd like to find a way to calculate yearn vault apy programmatically but "https://api.yearn.finance/v1/chains/1/vaults/all" seems not to give the same results as what we can see on the App. Would you know why? Is it because of a difference in time?


[01/28/2022 12:02 PM] defiglenn#3350
Have a look on joinwido.com , they show the last 3 months historical vault APY


[01/28/2022 12:45 PM] tche#3831
@defiglenn nice, I am looking. But do you know how they get it and if the data is reliable?

hey guys - i just bridged some FTM over to fantom network and want to test out the yearn vaults here. despite spookyswap and ftmscan displaying my FTM balance, yearn is not. Anyone know why? is there a lag?


[01/28/2022 3:48 PM] Crolev#3404
Hello,
Yearn vaults run on ERC20 type tokens, so you need to wrap your FTM first.
You can do it on SpiritSwap: https://swap.spiritswap.finance/#/exchange/swap/FTM/WFTM

@Unknown moved your question here
> *After a week, i still don't have any reward for my weth on fantom. Anyone have the same issue?*
Previously APY was much higher thanks to 0xDAO and veDAO farming, but now it's over because those protocols ended emissions and APY is back to normal. 
It will take a longer while until accumulated yield is high enough to be noticeable.

Thanks

im running 2 vaults on fantom for mim and dai with the apys around 15%, but somehow the amount in "earned" is waaay to little compared to this apy (like 1/10). i am in the vaults since a few days. what can be wrong here?


[01/28/2022 7:32 PM] Crolev#3404
The APY displayed next to vaults is based on 30 day average so it's skewed a bit by recent weDAO and 0xDAO farming that has ended by now. It will normalize over time.
In the meantime you can use yearn.watch to view the most up to date APR for each strategy used in a vault:

[01/28/2022 7:33 PM] de.hungriest#4847
ahh i see thank you for the quick reply! so eg even the 16% is a bit skewed from the 44% before from 0xDAO days etc


[01/28/2022 7:40 PM] Crolev#3404

@Unknown moved your question here:
> is there a way to see the actual apy over the last few days for a pool? ive been in dai like 4 days and so far projected for less than 1%
Assuming you're on Fantom network you can check it here:

yep im on fantom. this is interesting


[01/28/2022 8:16 PM] tailwagger#7100
i dont see where it says the actual payout? just want to make sure im not missing anything...and rewards from dai have been way below the 15% it says when you stake?


[01/28/2022 8:18 PM] Crolev#3404
The APY displayed on Yearn website is calculated as an average of the last 30 days and there was recent veDAO/0xDAO farming event that skewed that history. It will normalize over time.
If you'd like to check the most recent APR for each strategy in vault then click on Strategies tab, go into individual strategies and check the Reports tab - it contains information about all most recents harvests for each strategy.


[01/28/2022 8:23 PM] tailwagger#7100
ohhh thanks i see now. and the big strategy for dai is down to 4%


[01/28/2022 9:44 PM] Crolev#3404
@Unknown I moved your question here
> hi guys, im in the DAI vault, and it pays 15% APY. Does it take a while to spool up or something because i have been in for about 2 days and the amount earned is significantly less than 15% APY (even I reduce it to the APR equivalent)

Please check the discussion above - it's about the same topic.

refresh, you might see more profit now


[01/28/2022 9:47 PM] kx9x#3778
but still, I don't think the 15% is totally accurate since the skew from rolling average


[01/28/2022 9:47 PM] kx9x#3778
the team is working right now on adding more APY numbers to make it clear


[01/28/2022 9:47 PM] kx9x#3778
including per strategy apy and forward looking apy that isn't just an average of the past


[01/28/2022 9:51 PM] nbourbon#3184
I see that DAI APY is about 15% but after few days with my DAIs on that vault, I can see that I earned almost 0%. is that APY coming with some lag or wrong?

@Crolev you mentioned above to check the reports tab.. where do I see that reports tab?. and by the way, do you know if Yearn is planning to shift from scream to curve as to improve the yield?

You can check it here:
https://yearn.watch/network/fantom/vault/0x637eC617c86D24E421328e6CAEa1d92114892439
Click on the strategies tab, then go into individual strategies and you can view individual harvests in the reports tab on each strategy.

Vaults use multiple strategies and if some strategies perform better then over time funds will be shifted to them.


[01/28/2022 10:16 PM] Crolev#3404
If there are more protocols found that can be farmed then Yearn strategists will write new strategies and they will be implemented.


[01/28/2022 10:17 PM] Crolev#3404
Right now it's much harder to find good yield, because overall market is in bearish trend.

ethereum


[01/29/2022 2:23 PM] Crolev#3404
Hello,
That sounds about right - the yield is not linear, not the same every day or week and is dependent on factors such as price of the tokens being farmed, the one in a time strategies such as 0xDAO or veDAO or the monthly grants from the Fantom Foundation that are donated to vault token holders.
To get the best results from the vaults tokens should be held long term.

For data about the most recent harvests go to:
https://yearn.watch/network/fantom/vault/0x0DEC85e74A92c52b7F708c4B10207D9560CEFaf0

Select WETH as asset on top and ETH as asset on bottom. It will not make any trade, it will only unwrap your ETH from the contract.

Did you withdraw your WETH from yearn vault first?


[01/29/2022 2:48 PM] psyduck#5352
Is the APY on the vaults in Fantom of average over some time period or are they actual yields?  The reason I ask is that, doing my own back of the envelop computation, the yields on USDC seem lower than advertised.  Either that, or the website maybe doesn't update earnings continuously.  Either way, I'd like to understand the descrepancy between what I am see as the advertised APY and what I am earning in reality.


[01/29/2022 2:48 PM] kx9x#3778
it is a monthly average right now

[01/29/2022 2:49 PM] psyduck#5352
I see.  So, basically the current yields are WAY below the advertised yield, on account of the fact that APYs a week or so ago were like 5x higher.


[01/29/2022 2:49 PM] kx9x#3778
the advertised yield is just a monthly average, not a projection of future yield

you can see the big spike that day


[01/29/2022 2:52 PM] kx9x#3778
then 01/22 to around 01/25 you can see the slope increased from 0xdao


[01/29/2022 2:52 PM] kx9x#3778
now the slope is much lower since most of usdc funds are farming scream but scream tanked hard

[01/29/2022 2:53 PM] psyduck#5352
Yeah.  This is my concern.  The yields were super high when they were farming 0xDAO.  So, now that that's over, the average is including those insanely high yields.  The current advertised yield on BTC is like 10%, but that figure isn't close to the actual yield.  So, it would be nice to know what the actual yield is in some way or form.


[01/29/2022 2:53 PM] kx9x#3778
scream had a massive head and shoulders so yield dropped for us there

hey guys, quick question regarding vaults, I've staked some FTMs into vault but there are some pennies received, how is APY calculated on the asset? Currently it's 9,87% APY on FTM, do I get that percentage on FTM or on the earned $?


[01/29/2022 5:30 PM] Crypto Zen | ZEN#7405
Hi all, i also recently deposited some Stables into vaults, the APY doesn't correspond to the Earned amount on a daily basis.  The APY looks like it's actually much lower.  Do I need to wait a week for things to "catch up" or are APY calcs bugged?

Hello friends,
The metamask wallet I use in YF on Fantom has probably been hacked. Coins have disappeared from it to an address I do not know. 
I want to withdraw Bitcoin out of the Vaults and put it back with a new wallet. Is there a way to do this without going through the wallet which I deposited? I'm afraid the hacker has access to it. 
any help will be much appreciated.


[01/29/2022 8:53 PM] TorJado#3802
If you still have the yVault tokens, you can send them directly to another secured wallet


[01/29/2022 8:53 PM] shuvadam#2695
the vault tokens are in the vault

yes


[01/29/2022 9:12 PM] shuvadam#2695
i sent 1 FTM from binance


[01/29/2022 9:12 PM] TorJado#3802
if you want to test, you can deposit 1 ftm in the yearn fantom pool, send the yftm to your fantom wallet, and try to withdraw the ftm from yearn in the new wallet


[01/29/2022 9:12 PM] TorJado#3802
that way if something goes wrong, its only 3$ 😅


[01/29/2022 9:13 PM] shuvadam#2695

looking at the threads above I can't seem to withdraw from the vault  - and weth is not an option for available destinations for the withdrawal. What am I doing wrong?

@Unknown ibEUR does not have much liquidity, I'm not sure what the best way to withdraw it is at the moment, I think it is on either curve or fixed forex


[01/29/2022 9:18 PM] TorJado#3802
can you withdraw here? https://curve.fi/factory/3/

on yearn, can you withdraw to ibEUR


[01/29/2022 9:19 PM] TorJado#3802
you currently have yibEUR right?

and then withdrawing to ibEUR on the curve link


[01/29/2022 9:22 PM] TorJado#3802
and then swapping that on sushiswap or whereever


[01/29/2022 9:26 PM] zirkys92#2745
Thnaks on https://curve.fi/factory/3/withdraw it does not show any balance once wallet is connected  - so it must be a vault token correct (sorry just first few months in defi)

[01/29/2022 9:26 PM] TorJado#3802
yeah, so try withdrawing as curve ibEUR without changing the withdrawal coin


[01/29/2022 9:28 PM] TorJado#3802
you have a token - yCrvIbEUr which is a token saying yearn owes you crvIbEUr, and crvIbEUR is a token that says you have an LP for ibEUR-sEUR on curve. You can withdraw crvIbEUR for just ibEUR or sEUR, and you can swap that on a dex


[01/29/2022 9:28 PM] TorJado#3802
you are many layers deep my friend


[01/29/2022 9:28 PM] shuvadam#2695

add that to metamask


[01/29/2022 9:31 PM] zirkys92#2745
Yeah, you are right, I assumed yearn would handle the deconstruction of the token automatically back to ETH or whatever , as they automatically handled the construction of the token. Happy to unwrap the pair but not sure how as dex does not read the token in my wallet


[01/29/2022 9:33 PM] TorJado#3802
They often do handle it correctly, its just that they have a hard limit of slippage/liquidity necessary to do that


[01/29/2022 9:33 PM] TorJado#3802
they are very conservative to ensure not accidentally selling a ton of your tokens at a loss


[01/29/2022 9:34 PM] TorJado#3802
which step are you at?

[01/29/2022 10:03 PM] zirkys92#2745
Success. I withdrew from the vault to my yearn wallet (gas went down heaps) then converted pair on curve link and took it 100% as ibEUR and when it populates in my metamask I will swap it out on a dex - thanks Torjado

[01/30/2022 5:04 AM] HeliBen#2546
I am trying to withdraw from the curve LUSD vault (on ETH). The simulation for receiving curveLUSD works but for receiving USDC it keeps giving "simulation failed"
Is it safe to withdraw to USDC anyways, or should I assume the swap function doesn't work somehow and I have to withdraw curveLUSD?


[01/30/2022 5:05 AM] old_frog_#6669
sounds like its having a tough time calculating that extra tx , the vault would still need to withdraw curvLusd, and then swap to usdc


[01/30/2022 5:06 AM] HeliBen#2546
interesting, simulating withdrawing DAI and USDT works, too. Only USDC fails


[01/30/2022 5:07 AM] HeliBen#2546
I guess I'll better do that


[01/30/2022 5:09 AM] HeliBen#2546
oh but actually hitting withdraw to USDT yields another error message 😦


[01/30/2022 5:09 AM] HeliBen#2546
zapper api REQUEST FAILED (STATUS 500 )


[01/30/2022 5:10 AM] old_frog_#6669
could be zapper issue as well, as those functions were routed through zapper


[01/30/2022 5:11 AM] old_frog_#6669
maybe someone else has better feedback about this, but maybe easiest going dai or just exiting to lusd and then withdrawing from lusd on curve


[01/30/2022 5:11 AM] HeliBen#2546
I think only to curveLUSD works at the moment yes


[01/30/2022 5:12 AM] HeliBen#2546

yvWFTM is the vault token

im sorry, but i really dont understand what you mean. i know i have ywFTM in my wallet as soon as i got wFTM on yearn, but since a few days i dont get any wFTM on yearn, i dont earn anything.


[01/30/2022 10:49 AM] j.#6352
maybe the number of digits on the UI is not long enough to show the earnings


[01/30/2022 10:50 AM] j.#6352
if you look at the screenshot of the graph above, you'll see that it's growing constantly over time


[01/30/2022 10:51 AM] j.#6352
i chose a range of the past two days since your concern is about the past three days


[01/30/2022 10:52 AM] j.#6352
you might also notice that the Y axis goes from 1.88712 to 1.88724


[01/30/2022 10:52 AM] j.#6352

You mean you’re getting an error or literally failing and burning gas?


[01/30/2022 2:30 PM] fabri1983#0730
getting an error: failed fetch (or similar). No burning gas. Well, I'm assuming it's not burning any gas since on ftmscan the operation does not appear

FTM


[01/31/2022 7:41 AM] Crolev#3404
Try changing your RPC in Metamask settings from https://rpc.ftm.tools/ to https://ftmrpc.ultimatenodes.io/ and let me know if it worked. The default RPC is overburdened with the increase of load and it might be the cause of this problem.


[01/31/2022 7:56 AM] sdsr#8724
I tried but MM doesn't let me do the change, it flipped back to  https://rpc.ftm.tools/ automatically  while it says address not valid


[01/31/2022 7:57 AM] Crolev#3404
After making the change you need to click the save button at the bottom of the form - you need to scroll all the way down to see it.


[01/31/2022 8:18 AM] sdsr#8724
ok, I changed it and saved it but it didn't work, I still got the error .....


[01/31/2022 8:28 AM] Crolev#3404
Try also deleting a couple digits at the end of the number of MIM tokens you want to supply.
Also just to make sure - you do have some FTM to pay for the transactions, right?


[01/31/2022 8:29 AM] sdsr#8724
i have 10 FTM, enough for gas. I'll try deleting decimals


[01/31/2022 8:31 AM] sdsr#8724
Ughhhh, still the error!


[01/31/2022 8:54 AM] Crolev#3404
I think I found the source of the problem - it seems that Iron Bank has disabled supplying MIM which is visible on their main frontend ( https://app.ib.xyz/ ) but on Yearn website it gives this cryptic error.
I will talk to the team to see what can be done to fix the UI on our end.

@Unknown you need to approve your tokens first, before supplying them

it's the button on the left

Hi team, I have a question regarding the Dai stablecoin vault. The stated APY is 15.6%. I currently have about $9000 deposited into it. Per my calculations, 9000 x 0.156 = 1404 / 365 = $3.84 expected interest per day. I've had my money parked in there for 3 days so far and it's earned about 50 cents! Any idea what's going on?

already read that. for my link its showing the same amount of yLink as i have link deposited, for wFTM it doesnt


[01/31/2022 2:42 PM] j.#6352
it's not all the same


[01/31/2022 2:43 PM] j.#6352
that might mean that your LINK vault (or deposit) hasnt earned anything


[01/31/2022 2:48 PM] Kxlxxn#8789
it earned me way more than the wFTM deposit, because my wFTM deposit barely earns me anything atm, even tho it has a higher apy and a lot more fantom than i have Link

The ibGBP vault is harvesting nothing. I think something is wrong.

FYI moving funds to the strategy is also a harvest


[01/31/2022 3:11 PM] Robert Z#2072
Seems the actual returns on fantom chain are much lower than the posted APR on the website. Any way we could inspect the status of the vaults on fantom?


[01/31/2022 3:16 PM] defiglenn#3350
You can look on yearn.watch by: select fantom chain in top right -> clicking the vault of your choice -> strategies -> click on one to see the reports/harvests for it

How Yearn increases your yield | Yearn.finance
Almost everything that yVaults interact with is available to the public. So how is Yearn able to offer users better yield than they'd be able to achieve on their own?

[01/31/2022 3:35 PM] defiglenn#3350
yvBOOST automatically gains returns, you don't have to do anything with it. When you are ready to cash in, I believe you just sell it on sushiswap. The price goes up over time depending on how its performing


[01/31/2022 3:36 PM] defiglenn#3350
^ not 100% on this


[01/31/2022 3:37 PM] inthetrees#9226
So my position doesn’t increase, just the value. Its a better understanding than mine.  TY


[01/31/2022 3:48 PM] Crolev#3404
The way it works is that the ratio of yveCRV tokens to one yvBOOST token grows over time and whether yvBOOST is profitable for you depends on the price of yveCRV tokens.

You can view the increasing ratio of yveCRV tokens to yvBOOST vault tokens over time here:
https://yearn.vision/?orgId=1&refresh=1m&from=now-1y&to=now&viewPanel=24 (just select yvBOOST on the legend on the right)


[01/31/2022 3:51 PM] 0xNi#8324
Is the LUSD vault active? It has been showing nothing under Earned.


[01/31/2022 3:54 PM] Crolev#3404
When did you deposit?
Last time a harvest was done was a week ago. Your yield grows every time a strategy is harvested which can happen between every couple days to every couple weeks.

You can check here: https://yearn.watch/network/ethereum/vault/0x378cb52b00F9D0921cb46dFc099CFf73b42419dC


[01/31/2022 3:55 PM] 0xNi#8324
6 days ago


[01/31/2022 3:56 PM] Crolev#3404
Okay then you need to wait a little bit longer then. You can use the link from my message to check when the strategy gets harvested or watch #🌽mainnet-harvest channel.


[01/31/2022 3:57 PM] 0xNi#8324
thanks for answering. Is *Time Since Last Report: 6 days 21 hours 5 minutes* the last harvest time?


[01/31/2022 3:59 PM] Crolev#3404
Yep - next time a harvest is done it will reset.


[01/31/2022 4:08 PM] inthetrees#9226
Thank you for more info. Then i right for thinking that at anytime I exit my position of boost, it will be a capital gain transaction rather than an interest/income transaction?


[01/31/2022 4:10 PM] Crolev#3404
I don't know the tax code so I can't advise you on that. You probably should seek an advice from a licensed professional.

[01/31/2022 4:28 PM] Crolev#3404
Did you withdraw it from the vault already?
If yes then use curve to withdraw your funds from the pool: https://curve.fi/


[01/31/2022 4:30 PM] ravioli-give-me-the-formuoli#4421
I did, so now I have the crvLINK in my metamask


[01/31/2022 4:31 PM] Crolev#3404
Yep, and you can withdraw it from curve now


[01/31/2022 4:43 PM] ravioli-give-me-the-formuoli#4421
Can you share a link to the pool? I only found a pool for slink


[01/31/2022 4:44 PM] Crolev#3404

@Thirdwave take a look at the image below - it explains why is there a difference between the APY you see in the UI and the APY you are getting in the short term


[01/31/2022 6:58 PM] Crolev#3404
Basically the displayed APY is a long term rolling average (past data)


[01/31/2022 10:44 PM] inthetrees#9226
I forgot to ask you. Do i still earn this in rease if i swapped for the yvBOOST token rather than going through the other transaction methods


[01/31/2022 10:49 PM] Crolev#3404
yes, the increase in value accrues for the tokens regardless how you obtained them or how you hold them, yvBOOST tokens will be redeemable for more yveCRV in the future than they are right now


[02/01/2022 2:55 AM] p_rootes#3993

There are two transactions if this is your first time withdrawing from the vault. One is an approval, the second is the actual withdraw transaction.


[02/01/2022 4:33 AM] j.#6352

[02/01/2022 4:38 AM] Solarion#1348
Oh alright


[02/01/2022 4:38 AM] Solarion#1348
So im assuming gas is always super high to withdraw in this pool


[02/01/2022 4:39 AM] j.#6352
yes Curve-based vaults are almost always expensive, but the most ive paid before was just over $200


[02/01/2022 4:39 AM] j.#6352
Metamask might show a wrong estimate if you dont have enough ETH though. maybe that's why you see the $500 figure


[02/01/2022 4:39 AM] Solarion#1348
What other options do I have apart from paying this high a gas?


[02/01/2022 4:40 AM] Solarion#1348

I've been in ibGBP and ibEUR for weeks and still have "0" earned.  Why is that?   I noticed that harvest transactions have occurred with 0 profit, e.g. https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/879906686805106698/936732584577208320

Can you share a screenshot? Sounds like your withdrawal didn't go through


[02/01/2022 7:13 PM] grant#3690
I'm trying to understand the risk behind putting assets into a yearn vault 

The other day, I saw an admin in the channel mention that some of the vault strategies involved leverage. The docs mention borrowing from the iron bank, but not much else. Is there a theoretical scenario where the value of a token / multiple tokens drop, and vault(s) become unprofitable as a result of paying back leveraged loans?

Yearn’s vaults can be exposed to multiple strategies. Each additional strategy increases diversification but also increases the probability that a strategy could lead to capital losses.

I don't believe we have much history of vaults being unprofitable as the strategist in charge of the vault would move the users funds out at the point it became unprofitable


[02/01/2022 8:28 PM] Crolev#3404
The leverage is usually used for very safe purposes such as lending and borrowing the same asset in the same protocol if reward protocol yield is greater than the difference between lend and borrow and to borrow stables on a very low rate against the asset (i.e. DAI on Maker) and then use it to farm some other protocol at APY higher than the cost of borrow.

Thank you.

Hey, this cannot be right. You shouldn't receive a 1 to 1 yveCRV to yvBOOST, right? It should be with respect to the current ration.

[02/02/2022 7:03 AM] Crolev#3404
This means that for 100 yveCRV you will get an x amount of yvBOOST tokens that can be redeemed for 100 yveCRV.
Also it seems to be the old UI - make sure to use the new one: https://yearn.finance/#/labs

By the way yveCRV is still below its CRV peg so make sure you don't deposit CRV into yveCRV directly, but rather you either buy yveCRV on Sushiswap to deposit it to yvBOOST or buy yvBOOST tokens directly on Sushiswap - depending on what is cheaper at the current moment.


[02/02/2022 8:56 AM] Ale.Argento#6361
I can't understand how @yearn.finance works if I staked 25 ETH a week ago at 8.88% APY it gave me USD 1.17
How is this explained?

[02/02/2022 9:05 AM] Crolev#3404
The short answer is that the displayed APY is an average of the last 30 days and the short term APY might be different if yield from strategies has decreased recently - for example the price of Scream token which some strategies farm has decreased, as have lending rates and 0xDAO and weDAO farming ended which was the reason for the spike in APY in the last month.
Devs are working on improving the APYs displayed in UI so that they are more informative.

Hello,
I am staking almost 2 YFI on https://ygov.finance/stake
Please see below details.
I do not understand why I have no rewards available.
Is this the right place to stake YFI ? I own those 2 YFI and would like to stake it forever with the best possible APY. Can you please let me know what i am doing wrong.
Thanks much for the help.

========== STAKING =========
There are total : 36666 YFI.
There are total : 686.3752603442272 YFI staked in YFI governance pool (1.87% of total YFI)
= $17,070,152.72

You are staking : 1.9985 YFI (0.291% of the pool)
= $49,702.70

Votelock : NO

======== yCRV REWARDS ========
Reward rate : 0 yCRV per 1 YFI per week

Claimable Rewards : 0 yCRV = $0
Hourly estimate : 0 yCRV = $0.00 (out of total 0 yCRV)
Daily estimate : 0 yCRV = $0.00 (out of total 0 yCRV)
Weekly estimate : 0 yCRV = $0.00 (out of total 0 yCRV)

Hourly ROI in USD : 0%
Daily ROI in USD : 0%
Weekly ROI in USD : 0%
APY (unstable) : 0%


[02/02/2022 3:27 PM] Crolev#3404
This is a very old website. Please use the new one: https://yearn.finance


[02/02/2022 3:37 PM] zuroro#4574
thanks for your reply @Crolev . So this old version does not work ? Strange as it looks like the newest version (better than yearn.finance) and similar to https://fixedforex.fi/ or https://keep3r.network/ which I believe are from the "same family"... So if if stay on https://ygov.finance/staking nothing will happen ? I did pay for gas fees and etherscan shows success for this stacking of 2 YFI.... what is your advice to stake YFI for the long run with best APY please ?


[02/02/2022 3:38 PM] defiglenn#3350
Yearn.finance best place to stake YFI, you can also use as collateral to borrow against on the likes of Maker and Aave


[02/02/2022 3:42 PM] Crolev#3404
You can bridge your YFI to Fantom and put it into Yearn vault on that chain, you can create a Maker vault to borrow DAI at 1% APR and put that DAI into DAI Yearn vault to earn 3% APY and collect the difference and you can supply it to Aave (or other lending protocol) and use it as a collateral for leverage trading.
In the future you will be able to also stake your YFI in exchange for veYFI NFT (read https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth/proposal/0x8f7417fa5565d9f46e16618503e8808c36d51b2a9e8217a68c632d7c090d69d9 ), but until then you can consider above options.
Personally I have bridged my YFI to Fantom and put them into Yearn vault.

[02/02/2022 3:51 PM] zuroro#4574
i guess it created it just to DM me since crolev answered me


[02/02/2022 3:53 PM] zuroro#4574
concerning my issue... should I unstake from https://ygov.finance/stake ? and stake it on yearn.finance ? do you know the usual APY please ?


[02/02/2022 3:54 PM] kx9x#3778
yeah... unstake that for sure


[02/02/2022 3:54 PM] kx9x#3778
the yfi yield on the yearn vault at yearn.finance isn't great. we have had some okay strategies in the past but they kinda dried up. I bridge my YFI to fantom now to get yield


[02/02/2022 3:54 PM] kx9x#3778
but another option is to lend your YFI and borrow stables to farm


[02/02/2022 3:54 PM] kx9x#3778
or


[02/02/2022 3:55 PM] kx9x#3778
wait until we launch xYFI/veYFI a la #yip-65-passed and you will be able to stake it for profit sharing


[02/02/2022 3:55 PM] kx9x#3778
don't have an ETA for that yet though


[02/02/2022 3:56 PM] kx9x#3778
wow, a lot of people actually stake on that old contract


[02/02/2022 3:56 PM] kx9x#3778
how are they finding it?


[02/02/2022 3:56 PM] kx9x#3778
@Unknown how did you get pointed to that old staking contract and ui?


[02/02/2022 4:04 PM] zuroro#4574
thanks your reply. Not sure how, I guess through twitter yearn account....  not sure sorry... why not forwarding the website address to the new one then ?


[02/02/2022 4:05 PM] zuroro#4574
how to bridge it to fantom and what is the APY there please @kx9x ?


[02/02/2022 4:08 PM] zuroro#4574
15.65% not bad !


[02/02/2022 4:09 PM] zuroro#4574
i guess I will seek how to bridge my YFI to fantom and put it there until I can get profit sharing with YIP 65


[02/02/2022 4:09 PM] kx9x#3778
well....

this fantom API is a joke


[02/02/2022 4:11 PM] kx9x#3778
I think current APY is not great at all, so don't get too excited


[02/02/2022 4:11 PM] kx9x#3778
it was good during the vedao/0xdao period but that was short-lived


[02/02/2022 4:12 PM] zuroro#4574
@Unknown why do u think this API is a joke ?


[02/02/2022 4:12 PM] zuroro#4574
@kx9x what's your estimate of the currenty APY then ?


[02/02/2022 4:14 PM] kx9x#3778
based on scream lending rates, I think less than 0.5% to be honest


[02/02/2022 4:14 PM] kx9x#3778
we really need to update the UI to not use monthly


[02/02/2022 4:14 PM] kx9x#3778
I might start making more noise about it, it has been too long


[02/02/2022 4:15 PM] zuroro#4574
thanks for telling the truth


[02/02/2022 4:15 PM] kx9x#3778
like we do convert our fantom foundation grants and donate them to the vaults each month and that should happen in a few days, but TVL went up a lot so the impact there might not be as high as it was in prior months


[02/02/2022 4:16 PM] kx9x#3778
I might move back to lending my yfi on Tarot

and this one is true ?


[02/02/2022 4:18 PM] Crolev#3404
yes, but it's for liquidity pool tokens


[02/02/2022 4:19 PM] Crolev#3404
so you would be a subject to impermanent loss if one of those assets went up in price a lot against the other


[02/02/2022 4:19 PM] Crolev#3404
or is it


[02/02/2022 4:20 PM] zuroro#4574
yes I understand, tks @Crolev . ALso when exiting such strategy, I can chose to get either YFI or ETH or i will get what I supplied ?


[02/02/2022 4:20 PM] kx9x#3778
nope


[02/02/2022 4:20 PM] kx9x#3778
you just single side lend

oh okay then


[02/02/2022 4:20 PM] kx9x#3778
you don't have to farm with LP


[02/02/2022 4:20 PM] kx9x#3778
you won't earn any tarot tokens, but you get thicc supply side APR


[02/02/2022 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
you are providing liquidity for people to leverage


[02/02/2022 4:21 PM] zuroro#4574
May I ask: how secured/audited is tarot ? same family as yearn/keep3R/fixedforex ?


[02/02/2022 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
they get higher APRs, gov token print, but are susceptible to liquidation and IL


[02/02/2022 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
it is a fork of an audited bsc protocol called like impermax?


[02/02/2022 4:21 PM] kx9x#3778
it is not a yearn product.


[02/02/2022 4:22 PM] kx9x#3778
yearn will eventually use it for strategies, but the code is still be reviewed


[02/02/2022 4:22 PM] zuroro#4574
no track of hack in the past for tarot ? can u remind me of the site to look for such info please ?


[02/02/2022 4:24 PM] zuroro#4574
why don't you put it there (ie on tarot)? because you are supporting yearn products and prefer to put it on yearn vault on fantom ?


[02/02/2022 4:25 PM] kx9x#3778
oh because the apy on yearn was really high for a period of time due to the 0xdao/vedao strats


[02/02/2022 4:25 PM] kx9x#3778
and I was too lazy to migrate afterwards


[02/02/2022 4:26 PM] zuroro#4574

it's was there a few months ago, but i hardly check it so not sure what happened

[02/02/2022 4:37 PM] GoudaCheese#0667

[02/02/2022 4:37 PM] Crolev#3404
that's a curve token


[02/02/2022 4:37 PM] Crolev#3404
it's for the pool with USDC/USDC/DAI stables


[02/02/2022 4:38 PM] Crolev#3404
you can check your transaction history on etherscan


[02/02/2022 4:39 PM] GoudaCheese#0667
ok, it would be a yve token right

then it looks like the yvboost was sent somewhere


[02/02/2022 4:44 PM] Crolev#3404
Was it sent just as a transfer or as an interaction with a smart contract?


[02/02/2022 4:45 PM] GoudaCheese#0667
oh i thinnk i did that nevermind


[02/02/2022 4:45 PM] GoudaCheese#0667
i figured it out i think


[02/02/2022 4:45 PM] eoj#7391
ive had alot of money in there for a week or so and its done nothing, not word or UI warning. Had to come to the discord to find out

was it the yvboost?


[02/02/2022 4:47 PM] GoudaCheese#0667

If i wanted to bridge to fantom about how much gas would it be?


[02/02/2022 5:02 PM] GoudaCheese#0667

[02/02/2022 5:05 PM] eoj#7391
usdc/dai fantom vaults


[02/02/2022 6:02 PM] defiglenn#3350
hard to say, think it will say before you do it. Can bridge on spookyswap if you're looking for a place to do it


[02/02/2022 6:32 PM] GoudaCheese#0667
oh fantom, i haven't used those yet, so you think its not safe to use yet


[02/02/2022 6:36 PM] defiglenn#3350
It's safe to use, it's just the APY shown is misleading because it's based on the last 30 days where there was a highly performing strategy which has now ended. Returns closer to around 3% than the advertised 10% to take USDC on fantom as an example

i swear i havent got any yield in like a week lol


[02/03/2022 4:58 AM] Crolev#3404
It's working, you can check the growing share price here: https://yearn.vision/?orgId=1&refresh=1m&viewPanel=24&from=now-7d&to=now (select your vault on the list on the right)
The yield right now is much lower than before due to multiple factors: lending rates went down since the market is rather bearish right now, prices of tokens being farmed are lower and there's no one-in-a-time farms like 0xDAO or weDAO anymore.
Strategists are working on new strategies that that will help increase yield, but it will take a couple weeks until they get audited and tested properly to be deployed on production.

@Unknown moved your question here:
> I didn't recieve my yvwftm when depositing wftm into the vault, does this usually take linger than 20 mins?
The first transaction is approval of the token to be used by smart contract. You need to make a second transaction to actually deposit to the vault.


[02/03/2022 5:11 AM] Shrell#6263
I have deposited to the vault I can see it sitting in the vault. I added yvwftm to my metamask but havnt recieved anything


[02/03/2022 5:12 AM] Crolev#3404
Can you see the vault tokens on ftmscan on your address?


[02/03/2022 5:16 AM] Shrell#6263
Yes I can see 113 yvwftm tokens on ftm scan


[02/03/2022 5:23 AM] Shrell#6263
Also is that right you recieve about a quarter of the yvftm compared to how much wftm you deposit


[02/03/2022 5:27 AM] Crolev#3404
Each vault token can withdraw 1.887 FTM, so the amount of vault tokens you received times 1.887 should be equal to your deposit.


[02/03/2022 5:48 AM] Shrell#6263

[02/03/2022 5:58 AM] cryptoAslan#8635
is the zapper integration going to be fixed anytime soon? For weeks, it fails when trying to withdraw to ETH, always have to withdraw to CRV tokens, then to withdraw from curve costing extra fees for multiple steps


[02/03/2022 8:47 AM] shin0bi#0904
i mean seems like deploying to iron bank for the time being would be ideal bc i literally have not seen any yield in like a week x)


[02/03/2022 8:52 AM] Crolev#3404
There is a strategy like that in the works, but it takes a while until it gets vetted and deployed to production.


[02/03/2022 8:53 AM] shin0bi#0904
but it literally says "Lender Optimizer
Supplies DAI to Iron Bank or Scream whichever has the best yield to generate interest. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more DAI, then deposited back into the strategy."


[02/03/2022 8:53 AM] shin0bi#0904
like thats in the description for the vault


[02/03/2022 8:55 AM] Crolev#3404
I think that strategy would fold Iron Bank (supply and borrow simultaneously) to farm the protocol tokens.


[02/03/2022 8:55 AM] Crolev#3404
There is a similar strategy already, but for Scream


[02/03/2022 8:59 AM] shin0bi#0904
ah well that kinda doesnt make sense atm, seems like the optimal yield rn would be to supply to iron bank w out folding. literally says apy is 15% rn but ive made like under 0.1% apy last several days


[02/03/2022 8:59 AM] shin0bi#0904
something doesn't add up lol


[02/03/2022 9:00 AM] shin0bi#0904
i could jus supply to iron bank myself but like the vault is supposed to optimize for me isnt it

[02/03/2022 10:30 AM] Mr.G#8777
Hello team. Just checking apr showing on your website and apr I calculate. They are quite far away from each other. Can I read about it somewhere? Or can you explain real quick why that huge spread?

[02/03/2022 10:56 AM] Crolev#3404
The short answer is that the APY displayed in UI is historical - it's an average of the last 30 days.


[02/03/2022 10:56 AM] Crolev#3404
And it will differ from the short term APY.


[02/03/2022 10:58 AM] Mr.G#8777
I just calculated and it’s 5 instead of 15. That’s a huge gap. Will you adjust?


[02/03/2022 11:01 AM] Crolev#3404
Devs are working on improving the UI and displaying the APY in different time windows to make it more informative, but it takes time before it will get deployed in production.


[02/03/2022 11:03 AM] Mr.G#8777
Thanks. Meanwhile I would withdraw funds as we have to calculating with displayed APY without the need to recalculate daily or weekly. Will keep my eye on you guys and come back when proper displayed. Thank you very much for the info


[02/03/2022 12:20 PM] Linda2024#9260
Can I transfer the yvWETH token from one wallet to another wallet?


[02/03/2022 12:24 PM] Crolev#3404
Yes


[02/03/2022 8:37 PM] Kitteh#7534
Can anyone confirm if the other vaults are experiencing the same APY mismatch that we're seeing for DAI between what's stated and actually being earned? Like for MIM, USDT or USDC?


[02/03/2022 8:40 PM] Crolev#3404
The APY displayed in Yearn UI is an actual (real) average over the last 30 days and it's the same approach for all vaults. Short term yield will differ from that if the profitability of strategies has reduced recently.
Devs are working to make the UI more informative by displaying APY in additional time windows, but in meantime you can use this:

[02/03/2022 8:44 PM] Kitteh#7534
Yes, but given what i've earned over the last few days the real APY (not averaged) has been more like .002% daily. I get that what's being displayed is an average. I'm just wondering if people who are actively invested in the other stablecoin vaults are seeing as large of a discrepancy between the stated average yield and what they're actually receiving each day as rewards. Or am I missing something with regards to how rewards are paid out?

[02/04/2022 6:51 AM] zuroro#4574
hi guys, one question please. I am a long term holder of YFI. I understand current APY are bad but with YIP-65 it should get better. My aim is to deposit/stake my YFI at the right place to get the right APY and forget about it for a few years.... So is the vault on yearn.finance for YFI the right place to do so ? I mean currenty APY is 0.26% but this is the place where it might get better in the future ? or my YFI should be put some other place ? thanks much in advance for the advices.


[02/04/2022 6:53 AM] Crolev#3404
The vault has little funds so it takes time before it's worth it to harvest it.


[02/04/2022 6:55 AM] Crolev#3404
You can bridge your YFI to Fantom and deposit it to Fantom YFI vault that has higher APY.
You can farm it on various Fantom protocols.
You can open a Maker vault to borrow DAI against YFI and then put that DAI into DAI vault on Yearn to earn more income than debt cost.

[02/04/2022 6:58 AM] zuroro#4574
thanks @Crolev  I am not into fancy schemes like borrow against and deposit borrowed etc as I do not want to get liquidated. I am seeing long term... I am also a little bit worried doing bridging because of what Vitalik said about it and what happened with wormhole.... YFI bridge to fantom is safe ? The future of YFI will be more on Etherum or Fantom as per your opinion ? thanks much


[02/04/2022 7:01 AM] Crolev#3404
The bridge from Ethereum to Fantom is operated by Multichain (previously named Anyswap). You need to research it for yourself and decide whether you are okay with using it.
If you are then the bridge can be used through Spookyswap UI: https://spookyswap.finance/bridge


[02/04/2022 7:02 AM] zuroro#4574
got u tks. The future of YFI will be more on Etherum or Fantom as per your opinion ?


[02/04/2022 7:03 AM] zuroro#4574
my point is that is APY on Etherum will soon match the APY on Fantom, I can wait... But if you say fantom is supposed to be the blockchain around yearn, then I will bridge....


[02/04/2022 7:04 AM] Crolev#3404
Yearn will support more chains in the future, but there are no plans to shift away from Ethereum as mainnet.


[02/04/2022 7:04 AM] Crolev#3404
Yearn is not moving from Ethereum to Fantom, but rather supporting Fantom as an additional network.


[02/04/2022 7:06 AM] zuroro#4574
understood. many thanks. I thought Andre Cronje was in someway associated with fantom ? Sorry I am lacking of knowledge, hard to keep up with all devs ! is there a specific relation between andre/yearn and fantom ?


[02/04/2022 7:24 AM] Crolev#3404
Andre is a technical advisor to the Fantom Foundation and founder of Yearn. He's no longer affiliated with Yearn as he gave away all his YFI tokens. There is no direct relation between Yearn and Fantom Foundation.


[02/04/2022 7:26 AM] zuroro#4574
@Crolev  you rock, tks much for answering all my questions.... still not sure I want to bridge because of past issues (wormhole) and what Vitalik said.... do you think yearn vault on eth for YFI will get back to normal (at least more than what my bank offers) soon ?


[02/04/2022 7:28 AM] Crolev#3404
It's hard to say, because it depends on future yield from various protocols. If the current bear-market ends and we become more bullish then lending rates and prices of farmed tokens should go up, but no one knows for sure when this is going to happen.


[02/04/2022 7:29 AM] zuroro#4574
got u. one last question for today: how to explain the difference of APY for YFI between Etherum and fantom ? offer vs demand ?


[02/04/2022 7:30 AM] zuroro#4574
also did u personally bridged some of your assets through spookyswap ?


[02/04/2022 7:31 AM] Crolev#3404
There is orders of magnitude more value locked in Ethereum than Fantom so there's higher competition on Ethereum network.


[02/04/2022 7:32 AM] Crolev#3404
Yes, I bridged all my YFI there, but just because I did doesn't mean you should too. You need to do your own research into Multichain/Anyswap to figure out if you are comfortable holding your coins on that bridge.


[02/04/2022 7:35 AM] zuroro#4574
many thanks again


[02/04/2022 8:12 AM] jackfrosty747#7882

I would like to report again a problem that I had between 25 and 27 January. i am sure i interacted with yearn finance mim vault. I have already asked this question and I have but I would like to know where I can report.


[02/04/2022 11:59 AM] j.#6352
what problem?


[02/04/2022 12:02 PM] alenikov#4972
we have already spoken in private. but from research I have done I am sure I have interacted with the mim vault of yearn finance. As I have seen that yearn uses sushi in his strategy, and it turns out that my funds have actually been swapped into sushi, I would like to know if any funds have been stolen from the mim vault.


[02/04/2022 12:03 PM] j.#6352
didnt we already establish that your address has been compromised?


[02/04/2022 12:04 PM] j.#6352

[02/04/2022 12:08 PM] alenikov#4972
my address has not been compromised. I double checked several times afterwards. no other movements were made. it was just a problem interacting with that vault


[02/04/2022 12:10 PM] j.#6352
but you dont recognize the actions and movements we talked about


[02/04/2022 12:11 PM] j.#6352

[02/04/2022 12:11 PM] j.#6352
you said you never used xpollinate and you didnt even know what it was


[02/04/2022 12:12 PM] j.#6352
you also never used ethereum mainnet, but your address has actions on mainnet involving those transfers


[02/04/2022 12:22 PM] alenikov#4972
but the times of mim and ftm have not had any kind of problem? it is not possible to investigate? are there other channels where to report the problem besides discord?


[02/04/2022 12:24 PM] j.#6352
the fact that you dont recognize several of the actions means your address has been accessed by someone who is not you. this means access to everything with that address. it doesnt matter when something happened. the attacked has access to everything in that address


[02/04/2022 12:24 PM] j.#6352
you can report here in this channel as you did now and previously, but no one can help you


[02/04/2022 12:25 PM] j.#6352
i also recommend you stop using that address. i saw very recent actions


[02/04/2022 1:28 PM] alenikov#4972
the recent actions I have carried out with my address


[02/04/2022 1:29 PM] j.#6352
stop using that address!


[02/04/2022 5:57 PM] DerpeeDog#6148
G'day. After deposit into vault does it take a certain amount of time for the correct 'earned' amounts to reflect correctly? Mine doesn't seem accurate, I don't believe.


[02/04/2022 5:59 PM] Crolev#3404
The earned amount is increased every time a harvest is done which is between every couple days to every couple days for Ethereum and a couple times a day for Fantom.
The displayed APY is actual yield over the last 30 days, but it might be different from short term yield if profitability of strategies has recently declined.


[02/04/2022 5:59 PM] Crolev#3404
You can use a bot in this Discord to view the APY for additional time windows:

- and received 772 yvBOOST token worth $2756 (772×3,57).

The APY displayed in the UI is an average over the last 30 days. It will differ from short term APY if the profitability of strategies has declined recently - as it is the case here. Devs are working on adding additional APY timeframes to the UI so it's more informative.
In the meantime you can view the additional time windows using the bot:

The APY displayed in the Yearn UI is an average over the last 30 days. The earnings increase every time a strategy is harvested which happens every couple days or weeks for Ethereum and a couple times a day for Fantom.
You can view the harvests here: https://yearn.watch/network/fantom
And you can type `=ftmvault yvMIM` in #🤖bot-spam  to see the APY in additional time windows.

The APY displayed in Yearn UI is an average over the last 30 days and will differ from the short term APY if the profitability of strategies has declined recently - as it is the case here.
You can type `=ftmvault yvDAI` in #🤖bot-spam to view the APY for additional time windows or go to https://yearn.watch/network/fantom to view the APR of the most recent harvests.

No airdrop


[02/05/2022 11:27 AM] Crolev#3404
There will be a Fantom Foundation donation to Yearn in a couple days which is split between WFTM vault and other vaults, but given that TVL of Yearn on Fantom is through the roof it probably won't have the pump effect it had previously - now a lot of users put their funds into Yearn anticipating that donation.

First time farming?


[02/05/2022 12:12 PM] Crolev#3404
The lending rates and prices of tokens being farmed have both gone down recently which negatively impacts vault yields. There are more strategies in development, but it will take a while until they are vetted and deployed on production. Also there is a monthly grant from the Fantom Foundation coming soon that will be distributed to vault token holders through increased yield.


[02/05/2022 12:15 PM] pcliff069#8903
but if it is zero it is zero for all - not zero for 24 hours, then somehow it gets to a week %, and then a year. I understand things going up and down - part of the game. But not advertising 14 and actually paying zero. That costs me time and money.


[02/05/2022 12:16 PM] Crolev#3404
Devs are working on improving the UI to display the APY in additional time windows so users will be more informed about how the yield changes in the short term.


[02/05/2022 12:18 PM] pcliff069#8903
thanks -- but really doesn't answer why app is misleading and costly (wrapping, staking - thank f it was on fantom


[02/05/2022 12:21 PM] Crolev#3404
This UI was made with Ethereum in mind where harvests are done much more rarely than on Fantom - on Ethereum that could be between every couple days to every couple weeks so 30 day time window is perfect - on a daily or weekly the APY would be often 0 because harvest hasn't been done yet and on day of the harvest it would display a very large short term yield.

{Reactions}
👍 

[02/05/2022 12:22 PM] Crolev#3404
On Ethereum users try to stay in vaults for long term - for months or even years to optimize their tax costs and over such long periods of time the possible variances in yields average out.


[02/05/2022 12:22 PM] Crolev#3404
On Fantom users seem to try to game the yield to get as much of it in the short term which is unlike Ethereum users - so we are working on improving the UI to address that too.


[02/05/2022 12:25 PM] pcliff069#8903
look thank you, but I can't see any point in leaving this asset here - I know the risks are small but there are still risks so earning zero doesn't justify them. I was looking for a long term park - harvesting was not the issue, it is having an asset at risk earning zero. Might as well be in the Ledger.


[02/05/2022 12:31 PM] Crolev#3404
This is perfectly okay and understandable - I would not want to use a vault without any perspective of yielding profit either. This will eventually be alleviated, but new strategies need to go through the vetting process first so they are ensured to be safe. I would suggest only to wait at least until monthly Fantom Foundation grant is distributed so you don't leave with nothing.

How is decided the amount of assets assigned to each strategy? Or the % that each strategy has of assets with respect the total amoount of assets


[02/05/2022 1:36 PM] Crolev#3404
The allowances of each strategy in a vault is decided and updated through a multisig based on factors such as vetting status of the strategy and it's performance.

@Cha I moved your question here:
> hey, I was staking mim to yearn finance and all of the sudden they have completely disappeared and the pool does not exist in the vault, can someone please assist?
Did you deposit your vault tokens to any lending protocol?


[02/05/2022 6:20 PM] Crolev#3404
Also the way you worded this question might have prompted some scam bots to DM you


[02/05/2022 6:20 PM] Crolev#3404
Beware of DM scams.


[02/05/2022 6:23 PM] Cha#6235
thank you for doing so and I will definitely be weary of scammers. so yeah I first put my wrapped ftm on yearn finance to get yvwftm, I then put the yvftm on abacadabra to borrow mim, I then took those gained mim and put them in the mim pool in the yearn finance vault


[02/05/2022 6:24 PM] Cha#6235
now my mim I had on yearn finance have dissapeared


[02/05/2022 6:26 PM] Crolev#3404
Just to make sure - did you make both transactions to deposit MIM? First one is approval and the second one is deposit.
When you go to your address on ftmscan do you see the vault tokens on your address?


[02/05/2022 6:28 PM] Cha#6235
I don't do you have the coin address by any chance so I can add it to my metamask to see if it comes up?

Hi! I have a small amount of ETH (0.07) in a vault. I'm trying to withdraw it, but I keep getting an HTTP 500 error displayed. I have ETH in my wallet for gas, but either way I never even get a request to confirm the TX in my wallet (Metamask). Anyone seen something like this before?

You can type `=ftmvault yvWBTC` or `=ftmapy yvWBTC` in #🤖bot-spam to see APY for additional time frames.
Devs are working already on adding them to UI, but it will take a while longer.

Well, unfortunately there isn't much we can do to check that. Iron Bank is a separate project with its own team. Yearn only provides additional UI.

Hi to all, just one question. Today I have checked my vault with WFTM but it has disappeared. What is happened? Where are my tokens? Thanks!


[02/06/2022 3:17 PM] Crolev#3404
Did you deposit your vault tokens to Abracadabra?
Have you checked your address on ftmscan?


[02/06/2022 3:17 PM] Malark Morn#6456
Yes I have used the yvftm oh abracadabra


[02/06/2022 3:18 PM] Malark Morn#6456
But I have not been liquidated


[02/06/2022 3:18 PM] Malark Morn#6456
Still safe


[02/06/2022 3:18 PM] Crolev#3404
Then this is normal. You deposited your vault tokens to another protocol and you don't have them any longer in your wallet.
When you withdraw your tokens from Abracadabra you will see them in Yearn UI again.


[02/06/2022 3:19 PM] Malark Morn#6456
So I am not gaining the %vault?


[02/06/2022 3:20 PM] Crolev#3404
You are - the yield is distributed as a growing share price of the vault over time and it's the same regardless where you hold your tokens - in your wallet or in a smart contract.


[02/06/2022 3:22 PM] Malark Morn#6456
Thanks for your answers. Now it is clear 💪🏼


[02/06/2022 5:20 PM] DontHassleHoff#8210
hi - complete newbie question. i own the ERC20 token SYLO. yearn dashboard says i can deposit and the expected yield is ~32%. where can i read up on how this works?


[02/06/2022 5:24 PM] chud575#4936
ty


[02/06/2022 6:06 PM] kx9x#3778
That means you would swap your sylo for whatever vault you are going into


[02/06/2022 6:07 PM] kx9x#3778
It is just selling your sylo, so you won't own sylo anymore. If it goes up, you lose out on those gains


[02/06/2022 6:18 PM] DontHassleHoff#8210
thanks, i dont think its a good use of funds!


[02/06/2022 6:53 PM] Branji#7067
Can someone please explain where I am going wrong with yearn? I deposited 1220 WFTM at +10%. Acording to my APY calculator I should be earning about 2.2 WFTM per week. Just checked it and it says i have earned $0.68 in a week Doesn't add up to me. Not even close. Any ideas? I haven't used Yearn before. Thanks for any ideas.


[02/06/2022 7:12 PM] Crolev#3404
The APY displayed in UI is an actual average of last 30 days.
You can view it in additional time windows using commands `=ftmvault yvWFTM` and `=ftmapy yvWFTM` in #🤖bot-spam 
Devs are working on including additional time frames in the UI as well, but it's going to take more time.


[02/06/2022 7:29 PM] Branji#7067

It still says current rate is 8.8%, am I right. I haven’t been paid anywhere near that.


[02/06/2022 7:42 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
If you were in the vault the latest month you would have earned 8.8% APY during that time, that’s what it means


[02/06/2022 7:45 PM] Branji#7067
Ok. Any way to tell the current rate? I’ve been paid way lower than that. I must be missing something


[02/06/2022 8:08 PM] Crolev#3404
You can use the weekly rate you got from bot as a reference. The yield is not linear and varies depending on lending rates, proces of tokens being farmed and so on. So if it has recently declined as it the case here it will be lower than the monthly average.


[02/06/2022 8:15 PM] mugabuga#9342
Not sure if this is the right channel to be asking this in but how does the yvBOOST vault compare to staking CRV for cvxCRV on Convex? Yearn seems to be the much better option with a higher yield and autocompounding but I'm just wondering if I'm missing anything

It's a new vault so it will take a while until it shows historical APY, but I would expect something in line with what you can see on curve.fi for this pool.


[02/07/2022 3:06 PM] harvw#3182
cool thanks


[02/07/2022 3:13 PM] Crolev#3404
Unfortunately the way yveCRV tokens work (and same for cvxCRV) is that you lock up your CRV permanently into those tokens. This means that at times one yveCRV is going to be worth less than one CRV because people can freely trade them - as is the case here.
Hopefully the peg will be restored soon, but it might take a while until that happens.


[02/07/2022 3:13 PM] Crolev#3404
In the future I recommend to check on Sushiswap if it's not more financially viable for you to buy yvBOOST tokens directly.

You can view the growth of share price over the last 30 days in above link - just select your vault on the list on the right.
Your profit is the difference between share price at the beginning and at the end. At your position size it might take a while until the earned amount becomes noticeable.

Now I understand, thank you. Although, I stay a little sad and feel as if I had lost $926... Maybe you could put a "More info" button there in the vault to notify people about the SushiSwap way.


[02/07/2022 3:53 PM] svtmd1#0341
are the APYs on fantom yearn accurate?


[02/07/2022 4:04 PM] Crolev#3404
The APY displayed in UI is an actual average of vault performance over the last 30 days. It will differ from the APY in shorter term if the yield has recently declined as it is the case here - due to lending rates going down, farming tokens going down in price and farms getting retired. New strategies are in development, but it will take a while until they are vetted as safe to be deployed to production. There is also monthly grant from Fantom Foundation that is distributed to vault token holders through increased yield.
You can view the APY in additional time frames using bot commands `ftmvault yvWFTM` and `ftmapy yvWFTM` in #🤖bot-spam.
Devs are working already on adding those additional time frames to the UI, but it will take some time. In the meanwhile please use the bot.


[02/07/2022 4:30 PM] lowquat#4801
if the apy is the average over the last 30 days, shouldnt it go down instead of stay fixed for the past couple weeks? or does this apy update once a month and reflect 30 days before update


[02/07/2022 4:41 PM] Crolev#3404
It's rolling 30 days so it's always 30 days before today.
You can verify the APY for yourself by using http://fantom.yearn.science:3000/?orgId=1&refresh=1m&from=now-30d&to=now&viewPanel=24 and selecting your vault on the list on the right. Share price at the end divided by the one at the beginning and then annualized should be roughly equal to what you see in the UI.


[02/07/2022 4:49 PM] jackfrosty747#7882
The Fantom DAI vault is showing as 0% now.  Why is that?


[02/07/2022 4:52 PM] lowquat#4801
ty. i tried calculating the FTM tricrypto according to the link and the APY is ~10.84% while the site says 21.35%


[02/07/2022 5:00 PM] Crolev#3404
Sorry about that, this is clearly some error. I informed the dev team about this and I will get back to you once I get a response.

I've just checked and it looks wrong to me too


[02/07/2022 5:11 PM] Crolev#3404
Everything seems fine with yvDAI on Fantom:

yvDAI 30 day rolling average stated on Yearn website: 11.46%
In API ( https://api.yearn.finance/v1/chains/250/vaults/all ) it's also 11.46%
Based on yearn.vision ( http://fantom.yearn.science:3000/?orgId=1&refresh=1m&from=now-30d&to=now&viewPanel=24&autofitpanels ) it's (1.0682946/1.0591821)^(365/30) = 10.99% which is also in line with above - the difference is probably due to me using different compounding period than actually used in source code.

The yield is not the same every day (see attached pic) so the yield in short term will differ from yield in the long term. See also my message a couple posts above: https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/734811808401063966/940322082682720346

What error message are you getting?


[02/07/2022 6:24 PM] defiglenn#3350
You could give it a try on the Yearn UI at yearn.finance

Try a hard refresh ctrl + shift + r or shift + f5
or a different browser


[02/07/2022 7:02 PM] defiglenn#3350
Try asking in the #🏦iron-bank channel too if that doesn't work , it's not a Yearn product so i'm not sure what else to suggest


[02/07/2022 7:19 PM] Bfjohnson2#5110

Hello, I've deposited WFTM into the yVault a while back, but I don't seem to have the yvWFTM tokens in my MetaMask wallet, any ideas on what I could be doing wrong? Added the contract address from here: https://ftmscan.com/token/0x36e7aF39b921235c4b01508BE38F27A535851a5c but shows 0. Thanks in advance

Did you deposit your vault tokens to Abracadabra?
When you go to ftmscan and check your address do you see the vault tokens on your address?


[02/08/2022 3:22 PM] JHolme5 | perp.com#0113
Nope, I didn't deposit them anywhere. 

I see I have them on FtmScan but they don't appear in MetaMask. Should I just try depositing on Abracadabra and see what happens? Thanks for the fast response!


[02/08/2022 3:23 PM] Crolev#3404
No, you don't have to deposit them to Abracadabra.


[02/08/2022 3:23 PM] Crolev#3404
Go to vault page: https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x0DEC85e74A92c52b7F708c4B10207D9560CEFaf0


[02/08/2022 3:23 PM] Crolev#3404
And click the little metamask button.


[02/08/2022 3:23 PM] Crolev#3404
That should add the token contract address to your metamask.


[02/08/2022 3:24 PM] JHolme5 | perp.com#0113
OK, yh I already had WFTM added, just don't see yvWFTM


[02/08/2022 3:25 PM] JHolme5 | perp.com#0113
Added the contract address for yvCRV, and that works. It just does not work for yvWFTM.


[02/08/2022 3:26 PM] JHolme5 | perp.com#0113
You know what, I think it's just a UI/MetaMask issue, it doesn't show. When I go to Abracadabra, I am able to borrow and it shows my yvWFTM


[02/08/2022 3:27 PM] Crolev#3404
Oh okay - it should have pinged Metamask to add the vault tokens.
Try adding tokens based on contract address 0x0DEC85e74A92c52b7F708c4B10207D9560CEFaf0


[02/08/2022 3:28 PM] JHolme5 | perp.com#0113
Ah yes, that works, thank you!


[02/08/2022 3:28 PM] Crolev#3404
In Metamask on assets tab - at the bottom of the list click on import tokens, then paste above address and confirm


[02/08/2022 3:28 PM] JHolme5 | perp.com#0113
That's a diff contract address to the one on FtmScan?

[02/08/2022 3:47 PM] BuffedPotato#6290
yeah, that would've been my next question, how do I know the timing?


[02/08/2022 3:47 PM] defiglenn#3350
The amount will only go up when there's a harvest so it doesn't go up continuously, i'd check back in a few weeks and it should show a more consistent return


[02/08/2022 3:47 PM] defiglenn#3350
We can't say the timing because then people would deposit in the vaults just before the harvest, but it really ranges from every few hours to every few weeks depending on the vault


[02/08/2022 3:48 PM] BuffedPotato#6290
oh, yeah, that makes sense, thank you very much, that clears up everything

Hi all - I’m hoping someone from admin will be able to help.. Is there a location that stores updated prices for the yearn fund tokens?


[02/09/2022 12:32 PM] ONI#6888
you want to know the vault tokens' share price?


[02/09/2022 12:33 PM] ONI#6888
like yvWFTM share price or?


[02/09/2022 12:33 PM] drw76#0433
Yes please


[02/09/2022 12:34 PM] drw76#0433
And any of the yearn tokens generated from the LP’s


[02/09/2022 12:34 PM] ONI#6888
you can pull it from each vault contract via etherscan


[02/09/2022 12:34 PM] drw76#0433
The prices of them


[02/09/2022 12:34 PM] ONI#6888
you can also view share price here under harvest https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdffd/vault-overview?orgId=1


[02/09/2022 12:35 PM] ONI#6888
harvest Share Price = current share price and below it is a graph of share price over time


[02/09/2022 12:35 PM] ONI#6888
share price =/= $ price though


[02/09/2022 12:37 PM] drw76#0433
Sorry, what do you mean by this last comment?


[02/09/2022 12:37 PM] drw76#0433
Thank you very much for your help btw


[02/09/2022 12:37 PM] ONI#6888
So when vaults harvest they donate the profits to the vault, increasing share price


[02/09/2022 12:38 PM] drw76#0433
And so is the share price essentially the $ price per token held?


[02/09/2022 12:38 PM] ONI#6888
share price is the rate the vault token is converted to the base token


[02/09/2022 12:39 PM] ONI#6888
so for example yvWFTM share price is 1.887768087


[02/09/2022 12:39 PM] ONI#6888
so this is the fantom vault wftm


[02/09/2022 12:40 PM] ONI#6888
so if you deposit 100 wftm to the vault you get 100/1.887768087 = 52.9 yvWFTM


[02/09/2022 12:41 PM] ONI#6888
so if you know share price you can just do the conversion to base token then to find $ amount multiply by base token price


[02/09/2022 12:41 PM] ONI#6888
so vault share price just goes up over time as harvest is called and strategy earn yield


[02/09/2022 12:42 PM] ONI#6888
does that make sense?


[02/09/2022 12:43 PM] drw76#0433
Yes I think I’ve got it - If I have any further questions I’ll give you a shout


[02/09/2022 12:43 PM] drw76#0433

you can view the vault share price on yearn.vision if it increased that is when yield was harvested and added to the vault


[02/09/2022 6:02 PM] ONI#6888
its not zero I think yield has dropped for a bit I would wait till harvests happen

Maybe a little tweet about this issue would be useful to avoid this kind of repeated question, it would bother you less.

Hey guys, i am having an issue with wftm compounding... seems like its stuck


[02/09/2022 11:12 PM] bratok#5250
Not accruing anymore


[02/09/2022 11:28 PM] bratok#5250
Probably about a week or so


[02/09/2022 11:28 PM] bratok#5250
It compounded nicely for 2 weeks and then it stalled


[02/09/2022 11:29 PM] bratok#5250

Hey folks, I’m getting “Simulation Failed” when attempting to deposit to vault Curve CRV-ETH.  I was trying to deposit ETH assuming it would zap if needed. 
Any ideas or different ways I should try?

Hello! I have had my 7,640 WFTM staked for 3 days now... Why does my Earned column still show $0.00?  I should be earning about $3.60/day. I have tried to follow other support questions but I don't see what step I am missing. Suggestions?

[02/10/2022 3:02 PM] defiglenn#3350
With Yearn, the vaults don't earn continuously, it's at irregular times as mentioned above so it's probably because there hasn't been a harvest in 3 days


[02/10/2022 3:02 PM] Skydohr#4461
Interesting, so its also safe to say I'm not compounding either?


[02/10/2022 3:03 PM] defiglenn#3350
When the vault returns a profit, this will then compound, so the next time the vault earns a profit you will earn a larger profit


[02/10/2022 3:05 PM] Skydohr#4461
When is that going to happen lol? Is there anyway to see a history?

Can see here the vault hasn't return a profit since the 7th so it's normal what's happening. One thing I would say is that vault returns on FTM are low at the moment because our highly profitable strategies finished recently. We are working on coming up with some new ones at the moment

[02/10/2022 4:43 PM] defiglenn#3350
Have you got it deposited elsewhere? i.e. abracadabra, is your wallet connected?


[02/10/2022 4:46 PM] rg86crypto#6010
I see what's happened, had it in Abra, looks like got liquidated. Good thing it was a small trial amount!


[02/10/2022 5:18 PM] ONI#6888
ah sorry to hear that, when you have a loan best not to leverage too close to the liquidation point and to watch it carefully

[02/12/2022 7:59 AM] Crolev#3404
Which vault did you deposit to?


[02/12/2022 8:01 AM] spicylimon#9769
BOO and wETH (fantom chain)


[02/12/2022 8:03 AM] spicylimon#9769
I did two transactions. Meta mask sent back the receipt and it was successful however nothing came to the vault. I rechecked the account in my meta mask, the crypto amount is still there.


[02/12/2022 8:03 AM] Crolev#3404
Oh - so you still have the tokens you wanted to deposit?

[02/12/2022 8:04 AM] Crolev#3404
Just to be sure - when you go to ftmscan and check your address - do you see the tokens you wanted to deposit or vault tokens (they have names starting with yv)

hey not sure where to put this but if a user withdrawals their deposited crvCrvEth from Convex and then goes to try to deposit into the yvCurve-CRVETH pool - its reporting the amount of yvCurve-CRVETH you receive as the same amount of crvCrvEth -

if the vaults are suppose to accept deposited crv/eth in the crvCrvEth valut, and can accomidate then stake through the yearn yvCurve-CRVETH valut, then the caluclation is off 

if the yearn  yvCurve-CRVETH vault is NOT suppose to accept crvCrvEth that is deposited in curve already but not staked in the guage, then you might want to look at removing it as a selectable option

its the pooled token thats not deposited in the guage, 325 crvCrvEth is alot more than 327  yvCurve-CRVETH i beleive - atleast when i was playing with the amount of yvCurve-CRVETH id get from a small amount of eth - it was signifigantly different

try removing the decimals. If it doesn't work i'd recommend asking in the Cream Finance discord as Iron Bank is there product, not ours


[02/13/2022 2:44 AM] TurboRMK817#9553
Not sure if this is the place to ask, but I'm kinda stuck and no amount of reading the docs is helping me wrap my head around it... 

For the last 5 months or so I've had some funds in the yvBOOST strategy. That's been all fine and I have yet to even touch the funds in there by any capacity. However, about 2 weeks ago my "Vault Earnings" and "est. Yearly Yield" have dropped to $0.00 and have remained there since; which just seems odd.

Just wondering if there's a particular reason or if I need some kind of action on my part??

Anyways, thanks for any insight anyone can give me. I'd really appreciate it!


[02/13/2022 2:11 PM] TorJado#3802
@TurboRMK817 Can you confirm the yvboost tokens are still in your wallet on etherscan?


[02/13/2022 2:13 PM] j.#6352
if you moved them out of your address and back, your "earned" will change


[02/13/2022 2:14 PM] TurboRMK817#9553
Can confirm. Etherscan says I am holding the same amount of yvBoost tokens as when I first deposited.


[02/13/2022 2:17 PM] TurboRMK817#9553
I don't believe I have moved them out of my address. I actually haven't even touched my wallet — no deposits, no swaps, nothing — since I deposited into the yvBOOST strategy in October.


[02/13/2022 2:18 PM] j.#6352
im gonna go with "ui issue" on that one then. but i wouldnt rely on Earnings as useful info since yvBOOST price in USD fluctuates a lot


[02/13/2022 2:25 PM] TurboRMK817#9553
That's what I figured; thanks for reassuring me! Just wanted to make sure it was just a bug or something and not a lack of understanding of the strategy on my part.

from Vault to Metamask --> WETH
WETH -> ETH (??)

1. Withdraw from ETH vault to WETH
2. Unwrap WETH to ETH (you can do this on any DEX or AMM or on Zapper)

tell me, a LUSD pool on eth, with a large drop in ETH, ETH is credited, the strategy sells them and puts LUSD, as well as LQTY?


[02/14/2022 1:18 PM] defiglenn#3350
Supplies LUSD to Liquity's Stability Pool to earn LQTY rewards and ETH (from trove liquidations). Earned tokens are harvested and sold for more LUSD which is deposited back into the strategy.

hey.  I've just added more collateral however my "Borrow limit used" has not gone down.  The new funds have collateral turned on, have shift+f5, and changed in and out of wallets.  Any ideas why it's not updating?  Just don't want to get hit with a liquidation.


[02/15/2022 3:53 AM] kx9x#3778
What is the collateral?


[02/15/2022 3:54 AM] kx9x#3778
Check the iron bank front end for collateral cap, see if the asset is capped now


[02/15/2022 3:54 AM] kx9x#3778
app.ib.xyz should show collateral remaining for an asset


[02/15/2022 3:54 AM] Beaker#6686
TUSD


[02/15/2022 3:56 AM] kx9x#3778
That has a collateral factor of 0%


[02/15/2022 3:56 AM] kx9x#3778

[02/15/2022 7:40 AM] j.#6352
you'll find them in the Labs section on the menu on the left. If you're coming from CRV, just buy yvBOOST on Sushiswap instead of depositing to yveCRV then to yvBOOST

[02/15/2022 2:58 PM] ONI#6888
yes you should be able to zap it into the curve usdn vault did you try?

**from discord support**

Keep in mind that if you have an IP address that was used at any point by a user who was banned, you might be banned because of that.

Also, if you were a member of the server in the past, it is possible that a "ghost" version of your account is still a member. This will prevent you from joining again. Have the mods check their user list to make sure your Discord Tag isn't on it. If it is, and you're not in the server, it could be that you weren't fully kicked originally. Once your "ghost" is kicked, you should be able to join again.

Another option is that a moderation bot has your Discord Tag in its blacklist. You can ask the mods to check each bot's blacklist to ensure that your Discord Tag is not on it.

I hope this information helps, but if you still can't get in, let me know!

Hi, I'm trying to do my taxes, but am unsure how to download my transactions from yearn finance, so that I can upload them into a tax program. Can someone please help?


[02/16/2022 8:19 PM] esdmd#8067
sorry, I guess this should be in the other section.


[02/16/2022 8:51 PM] old_frog_#6669
tokentax software is pretty helpful, there may be some others as well


[02/16/2022 9:10 PM] esdmd#8067
Thanks for the reference. I joined cryptotrader.tax today because I did a google search for how to report taxes for yearn finance, and they were one of the top links in the search results. I thought there was some way for the platform to connect to Yearn.finance dApp to download the transactions, but that doesn't seem to be the case. After reading more, the cryptotrader.tax site actually says that I have to download the transactions from yearn.finance and then import them into the platform, but I can't figure out how to do download the history of my yearn transactions. Any help with that would be awesome! Maybe I screwed up by going with cryptotrader.tax. Does TokenTax connect to the Yearn.finance dApp? or, is there some sort of API, or how do people get the history of their transactions with Yearn? Do I have to use my wallet address somehow to get the history? I'm a bit embarrassed because I feel like that's a total amateur question.


[02/16/2022 9:12 PM] bfs#7030
centralized tools usually have an export tool of some sort


[02/16/2022 9:12 PM] bfs#7030
the challenge with yearn providing a tool is because nobody knows how this is supposed to be taxed


[02/16/2022 9:13 PM] bfs#7030
but anyone can technically generate a list of transactions using your address and a chain scanner


[02/16/2022 9:14 PM] bfs#7030
i think there's a use case for yearn to support some kind of historical transaction list with richer information than scanners provide


[02/16/2022 9:14 PM] bfs#7030
but i dont think thats gonna happen before tax day


[02/16/2022 9:16 PM] bfs#7030
have you used a chain scanner before


[02/16/2022 9:23 PM] esdmd#8067
Maybe generating a list of the transactions might be an option for now. Presumably, their may be a difference between interest/gains from deposits in the vaults, and interest/gains from holdings in the labs. Unfortunately, I've never used a chain scanner before. Any suggestion on where to go and get some instruction on how to get the info that I need would be awesome!

I'm not sure about the use case being aligned with mission/goals of yearn, but, as of right now, I would truly find it very, very useful.  I'm maybe more of a casual user that heard about yearn and thought it was a cool idea, but jumped in before thinking about how I might have to report earnings. I could see it being found useful and an attractive feature by more and more people, as yearn continues to grow. Presumably, institutions and large investors would want something like this too.


[02/16/2022 9:24 PM] bfs#7030

go to https://etherscan.io/
In the top right, search for your wallet address.
Once the page loads, click the "ERC20 Token Txns" tab on the bottom table. This table has all of the ERC20 transactions for your wallet.

When you deposit a token (let's say, USDC) into a Yearn Vault, what happens on the chain is the following:
1. The requested amount of USDC is transferred from your wallet to the yUSDC vault.
2. The yUSDC vault sends a special token called "Yearn USDC (yUSDC)" to your wallet. This special token is used to keep track of how much your wallet has deposited into the vault. 

When you withdraw from a vault, the following happens:
1. Your wallet transfers yUSDC to the vault
2. The vault sends USDC to your wallet based on the amount of yUSDC that was in it. If the vault has made a profit since you deposited, your yUSDC is worth more USDC than it was originally. 

Now let's go back to that ERC20 Token Txns table. Here's a random person's ERC20 history who I will use for an example: https://etherscan.io/address/0x88476e1953b95f2c0c89a291315fd6dce834c8cc#tokentxns

522 days ago, this user deposited 202.91512703 DAI into the Yearn DAI vault. During that same transaction, the yVault sent their wallet 201.029081609044721832 yDAI, which is used to track their deposit.

35 days ago, this user withdrew from the DAI vault. The 201.029081609044721832 yDAI is sent to "Null Address", which is a fancy way of saying the user sent it to the vault and the vault deleted the tokens.
In response, the Vault calculates how much their yDAI is now worth, and sends their wallet 232.193041028937622109 DAI. 
This transaction represents a 31.1639594199 DAI profit for this user.

That should get you started. Also very important: never manually send DAI, yDAI, or any other token directly to a contract. Only use the front end for the relevant protocol - there's additional code stuff that goes on behind the scenes that can't be reproduced by manually sending tokens.

gm everyone! my question is about yearn fantom vaults... I deposited some WBTC in the yearn fantom vault a longer time ago.. the first days the I saw the progress of the collecting yield but since weeks this progress is stuck and it seems that my staked WBTC aren't earning anymore. does anybody have a clue?


[02/17/2022 5:51 AM] Josi#9689
APY means Annual Percentage Yield. This includes your funds auto compounding in this vault.


[02/17/2022 5:56 AM] Josi#9689
Under the same circumstances your staked funds will rise 13.07 per year and 0.09% per day. The monthly APY can't be the same as the yearly APY so there is something wrong. The numbers are always changing and are depending on daily price changes, market activity and the number of persons participating in a vault/pool.


[02/17/2022 10:20 AM] agnes#9039
Sory for the noob question: I'm trying to understand harvesting events for the vaults utilizing strategies convex-->curve. Can i understand from these transaction data how many of which tokens were exactly harvested? If i get it right, post harves event these tokes should be swapped for the vault's token and added to the total pool


[02/17/2022 11:21 AM] defiglenn#3350
Not really sure what you mean, sorry. Could you try explaining again?


[02/17/2022 11:21 AM] defiglenn#3350
When you make a withdrawal the yv tokens get exchanged back for the token you deposited, plus any profit from being in a vault


[02/17/2022 11:49 AM] agnes#9039
Effectively I'm trying to understand what exactly increases a share price. After reading history of chat in this Discord my understanding is that share price increases with harvest (which is released to the vault or strategy linearly for 6 hours) what I would like to understand from data is what exact tokens are harvested (how many, which ones?) that are behind this harvested value and share price increase. Maybe I am asking wrong question alltogether?


[02/17/2022 11:57 AM] defiglenn#3350
Depends on each strategy really, i'd recommend reading vaults.yearn.finance to see what they each do


[02/17/2022 11:58 AM] defiglenn#3350
Every time a strategy earns a profit this is called in with the harvest, where tokens are sold so that the native deposited token can increase (this is how you see the share price increase)

If you deposited after the 25th Jan you would have missed the high return harvests and the small profit generated would have been eaten away by Yearn fees.


[02/17/2022 10:03 PM] sama#6811
Ok, but when do I get profit for the amount of time that I have been staking? Otherwise what the point of leaving in a vault if its not going to reward.

I have had DAI in yearn at 10% apy... but it doesn't seem anywhere near that, is there a reason for this?
ive had 24k invested in Yearn's Fantom Dai deposit for 21 days and it's only earned $12.31... is this correct?
its 10% apy, shouldn't that be $6.57 a day?


[02/18/2022 4:32 AM] sama#6811
Sorry, i dont fully understand your answer. With new strategies, when the harvest is triggered do I get all my 22 days (or whatever that is at that point) in one go?

Vaults are DeFi products generally involving automation and yield aggregation. Liquidity pools involve users depositing a pair of tokens to DEXs/AMMs to earn trading fees from that DEX/AMM pair

just to be clear - defiglenn meant that you should use Fantom in the future, since you have already deposited to a Yearn vault on Ethereum you will still have to withdraw on Ethereum first


[02/18/2022 5:05 PM] JeffB [IND]#2977

Hello, I've been in the Fantom WBTC vault for 2 days and still haven't noticed any yield in the earned column, is this normal?


[02/18/2022 5:30 PM] defiglenn#3350
if you click on reports here you can see that there has been harvests in the last couple of days : https://yearn.watch/network/fantom/vault/0xd817A100AB8A29fE3DBd925c2EB489D67F758DA9/strategy/0x0ed5c4effed69b39c86a8d806462d709fb96a9e4 , I think what's happening is the 2% management fee is eating up the profits

Hey thanks for the reply!
I clicked on your link and there were some harvests but still I didnt make any gains, considering that I have been in the vault for almost a month now I was wondering if there is a way of me calculating my gains vs the fees. Rn doesnt seem to be worthy it.
ps: the baywatch guy took me completely by surprise, I lol'd 😂


[02/18/2022 8:57 PM] psyduck#5352
About a month ago, I deposited WBTC into Yearn's Fantom vault.  But, the return I got (computed on my own), was less than half of the advertised yield.  I understand that this was due to the fact that there were some really high yields on SCREAM, which entered into Yearn's return average.

I see the WBTC vaule is still yielding something like 10%, which is much greater than anything else I see on WBTC.  So, I'm tempted to deposit again.  But, I'm concerned that the advertised APY is no accurate.

Can anybody tell me anectodally if they are getting a yield that is close to the advertised yield?  Alternatively, is there some  3rd party website that i can look at to see real-time yields?


[02/18/2022 9:07 PM] Crolev#3404
Hello,
The displayed APY is an average of the last 30 days and is not indicative of future performance. The last 30 days included higher lending rates, higher token prices and (now retired) ve(3,3) strategies for the new Andre protocol. To view the APYs for additional time windows move your mouse over the percentage you see on Yearn website - it will display a tooltip in which you will be able to see a more recent weekly APY.
Could you please double check when did you make the deposit? It was probably less than 30 days ago so it didn't catch the ve(3,3) farming.


[02/18/2022 9:14 PM] sama#6811
This is exactly what @defiglenn said to me. I deposited 23 days ago, right after the big yield. However there were some harvests made in between and I still didt got any rewards.


[02/18/2022 9:16 PM] Crolev#3404
You can view the dynamics of share price growth (which constitutes your profit) here:

It looks like that ^


[02/18/2022 9:16 PM] Crolev#3404
And as you can see unfortunately the yield was great at the beginning of the month


[02/18/2022 9:17 PM] Crolev#3404
but then after bear market hit it flattened out


[02/19/2022 4:11 PM] bitznbrewz#7086
Came here to ask the same question about the FTM WBTC vault 😦


[02/19/2022 5:12 PM] grnlf#0071
On IronBank, when I supply an asset, is there anything I need to do to begin earning the displayed apy % on that asset?


[02/19/2022 5:18 PM] Qstick84#7100
Have had another look here and can see there's been another harvest but still see nothing in earned. Could it take more than 3 days to offset performance fees?


[02/19/2022 6:57 PM] Veloth#9002
You ever get an answer to this? I'm getting basically nothing from the Dai vault on Fantom. the APR is WAY OFF!


[02/19/2022 7:15 PM] gruntrush#5702
I'm not understanding how the APY's are calculated. I have had my BTC deposited for over a month.  For the entire month the advertised APY has been between 11-14%. Even at 10% I should have seen about $350 earned. But the Earned column says $0.95! That's quite the disparity.

[02/19/2022 8:15 PM] Josi#9689
I staked some of my WBTC on yearn Fantom. The first time I could watch well how profit is collected, but after some time it suddenly stopped. I had already reported the problem here in Discord and a mod told me that it was because my wallet provider no longer synchronizes. I then tried a few things and disconnected and reconnected my Meta Mask (with Ledger hardware wallet). That didn't change anything either. In the end, I unstaked and restaked my WBTC in hopes that I could then watch my profit again. Since then, however, nothing has happened. I can withdraw my WBTC just as I have staked it and I just can't figure out why it doesn't generate any yield. Does anyone know this problem or has anyone solved this problem?


[02/19/2022 8:17 PM] Crolev#3404

[02/19/2022 8:34 PM] Josi#9689
I've read through the comments and I have to say I don't find it very satisfying. More clarity from yearn would be desirable and would lead to fewer misunderstandings. After all, people want to make money and would not put their bitcoins in a smartcontract from yearn for a few peanuts. Thanks anyway.


[02/19/2022 9:21 PM] Crypto Lodge#1791

[02/20/2022 9:15 AM] Crolev#3404
Take a look at the chart from this message: https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/734811808401063966/944386942542438421


[02/20/2022 9:16 AM] Crolev#3404
The yield is not linear - is not the same every day. It varies depending on day and week and the APY displayed on the website is an average over the last 30 days - which means it will be different from future 30 days.


[02/20/2022 9:17 AM] Crolev#3404
And as you can see on the chart there was period of high yield couple weeks ago that abruptly ended and the yield has flattened a lot since then.


[02/20/2022 9:27 AM] legendfan#5056
I hope you team'd never harm the reputation of YEARN.


[02/20/2022 9:31 AM] RaulGG#9502
Aha...so when will be the last month APY displayed?


[02/20/2022 9:42 AM] Crolev#3404
it is already last month yield


[02/20/2022 9:48 AM] RaulGG#9502
I mean for this month. When the APY displayed is updated? First of month with the last month APY?


[02/20/2022 9:50 AM] Crolev#3404
It is a rolling average so it goes forward day by day


[02/20/2022 9:58 AM] RaulGG#9502
Okey


[02/20/2022 9:58 AM] RaulGG#9502
But in a week hasn´t change (13APY)


[02/20/2022 9:59 AM] RaulGG#9502
So it´s impossible that apy is the current one


[02/20/2022 10:07 AM] Crolev#3404
Yes, unfortunately right now there is a problem with updating the API that populates this number, but given current market dynamics it is still very close to being accurate.
If you go to yearn.vision and calculate the APY yourself then it will be close to that number: (1.0105632/1.0026395)^(365/30) = 1.10050952987.


[02/20/2022 10:08 AM] RaulGG#9502
Thanks for all the info @Crolev. So the current APY it´s about 1.1 isn´t it?


[02/20/2022 10:09 AM] Crolev#3404
It's about 10% based on above calculation


[02/20/2022 10:11 AM] RaulGG#9502
Really wish that APY to be true, but i´m not very convinced about it


[02/20/2022 10:12 AM] RaulGG#9502
$0 generates in 1 week?


[02/20/2022 10:13 AM] RaulGG#9502
I´ve got like $1500 deposited..


[02/20/2022 12:23 PM] Gaël Bw D#8228
I noticed the non linearity of yield (big steps in hours vs flat-like for weeks)  on the Fant/ yvDai on yearn.vision. Like many people, I'm a little worried by it and would be reassured if I understood why it isn't more regular. After all, everywhere on DeFi, yields are paid +/- in a steady stream. Could seine give examples on these irregular sources of income, Please?


[02/20/2022 12:38 PM] Crolev#3404
Yearn farms those protocols for you - those that otherwise you'd farm yourself. This means that the yield will be less predictable and will be a subject to current market dynamics - will go up and down along with lending rates and farmed token prices. It is not an easy task to show future yield, because in crypto situation can change within just a couple hours which will affect the forecasted APY.
Instead you should use both the longer term 30 day average APY and shorter term time frames - if you drag your mouse over the APY percentage on the website then you will get a tooltip that will show the APY for additional time frames.


[02/20/2022 12:52 PM] Gaël Bw D#8228
Market dynamics are not responsible for the steps we see in yield returns, are they? It feels more like a harvest question, and that I want to better understand. Thx for these elts


[02/20/2022 12:53 PM] Gaël Bw D#8228
I mean market condition variations would change the steepness, I get that. But steps feel more like a bank account when a wage is transfered, not a varying yield. Not sure I'm clear enough in my question though...


[02/20/2022 5:38 PM] kastle#9317

Hi all, a bit of a rookie question here - I've connected my metamask to yearn and now I'm trying to disconnect it so I can connect a different one. Can anyone let me know how to do this, please?


[02/21/2022 6:44 AM] vany#0365
when you open MM just switch that to the wallet you want to connect. then a little popup should happen where you have the option to click "connect" under the new wallet


[02/21/2022 6:46 AM] KJ#1239
Ah yes, I had a feeling it would be something fairly simple! Thank you so much for your help.

Hello, Could someone help me with APY calculation, what method in contracts I need to know in my case?


[02/21/2022 8:06 AM] Crolev#3404
You just need to check the changes in pricePerShare variable over time - the higher it is since your deposit the more yield you have gotten.
You don't have to query this kind of data yourself and instead you can use yearn.vision for this purpose:
https://yearn.vision/?orgId=1&refresh=1m&viewPanel=24&from=now-30d&to=now - just select the vault you're interested in on the list on the right and the chart will display the dynamics of share price growth over the last 30 days


[02/21/2022 8:08 AM] vodis#8536
@Crolev Thanks a lot! I'll check.


[02/21/2022 8:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hello, anyone knows what's happening with the WFTM vault? It says 7.89% APY but it seems to generate no rewards whatsoever?


[02/21/2022 8:33 AM] Crolev#3404
The APY on the website is an actual rolling average over the last 30 days and it is not indicative of the future yield. You should drag your mouse over the percentage you see on the website to see the APY in additional timeframes - i.e. the weekly one which will be closer to what you should expect in the short term.


[02/21/2022 8:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
Understood. The weekly one says 1.07% but my reward is still zero since I stake a week ago. Why might that be?


[02/21/2022 9:00 AM] Crolev#3404
Which day did you deposit on exactly?
Exactly 7 days ago the pricePerShare of the vault was at 1.8881214 and today it's at 1.8887686. If we ratio this and then annualize then we get ((1.8887686/1.8881214)^(365/7)-1)*100% = 1.8% APY
You can check it yourself on https://yearn.vision/?orgId=1&refresh=1m&viewPanel=24&from=now-7d&to=now

Thank you. This is helpful. I'll double check the chart.

is there a harvest tracker for ftm network deployed anywhere?  I am in love with the mainnet-harvest channel


[02/21/2022 10:54 AM] ONI#6888
if it doesnt have ftm network yet then no we dont have one, but I can look into expanding that one to fantom


[02/21/2022 10:55 AM] Apocalyp#3581
no rush on it, was curious if I was missing it.  I keep wanting to make a strategy and observing how they run interests me.


[02/21/2022 11:26 AM] kastle#9317

i dont understand, i send to wftm and it go nowhere


[02/21/2022 11:28 AM] Malicite#3853
do the displayed apy's on the site take into account the management and performance fees?


[02/21/2022 11:30 AM] defiglenn#3350
What were you trying to do? I'm not sure what you've done. Were you trying to turn FTM into WFTM?


[02/21/2022 11:30 AM] defiglenn#3350
yes


[02/21/2022 11:30 AM] kastle#9317
yes   i was try to turn ftm to wftm and stake into yearn


[02/21/2022 11:30 AM] defiglenn#3350
What site did you use to do this?

[02/21/2022 11:31 AM] ONI#6888
yes everything but the gross on the hoverover is after fees, and the monthly calculation shown on the main vault page is after fees


[02/21/2022 11:31 AM] kastle#9317
after i have my wftm and stake it show insufficient gas fee, so i transfer some ftm into metamask


[02/21/2022 11:31 AM] kastle#9317
but everything gone in the end


[02/21/2022 11:32 AM] ONI#6888
looks like you sent it to the wftm contract? not sure how you did that


[02/21/2022 11:33 AM] ONI#6888
you sent it to the wrong address, its gone. I would say make sure you double check where your sending/the address you copied. Sorry

[02/21/2022 11:34 AM] Malicite#3853
cool, so for example the yvDAI weekly is actually about 2.7% which is what scream and IB are paying but the total but after fees it yields .56%


[02/21/2022 11:35 AM] kastle#9317
another question, if i stake 100wftm into yearn vault, shoud i have the same amount of yvWFTM in my wallet?


[02/21/2022 11:35 AM] ONI#6888
no

see this to address


[02/21/2022 11:44 AM] ONI#6888
you put the wftm contract address and not your own address or whoever you wanted to send the wftm to


[02/21/2022 11:44 AM] ONI#6888
if this was on spookyswap I would talk with them, if it was via metamask then it must have been your mistake


[02/21/2022 11:47 AM] kastle#9317
i was want to send wftm to yearn, but i made a mistake...


[02/21/2022 11:47 AM] ONI#6888
you cant send them to yearn


[02/21/2022 11:47 AM] ONI#6888
you have to call deposit...

[02/21/2022 11:48 AM] ONI#6888
you were trying to send wftm to the wftm vault contract?


[02/21/2022 11:49 AM] kastle#9317
the first time it failed, so i copy the address and change the nonce manually like i did to transfer on eth chain...

Yah dont do that, please use our website yearn.finance to make deposits. That will ensure that all is working and you are interacting with our smart contracts in the correct way.

hey guys. I added some weth to the vaults for a few days (2-3 days) but the balance decreased (-0.0001 weth) . Does anyone have the same question or know why?

[02/21/2022 1:28 PM] cet#1677
they apy is shown in 8.99% (fantom)


[02/21/2022 1:29 PM] Crolev#3404
Regarding negative earnings check this message: https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/935258377053929472/945333619512197141

And regarding the displayed APY:
The APY on the website is an actual rolling average over the last 30 days and it is not indicative of the future yield. You should drag your mouse over the percentage you see on the website to see the APY in additional timeframes - i.e. the weekly one which will be closer to what you should expect in the short term.


[02/21/2022 1:36 PM] cet#1677
@Crolev cool cool thanks so much! will check it out a few days later.


[02/21/2022 2:42 PM] SHOLOM#6927
When will the apy back to 8% again ?


[02/21/2022 2:42 PM] defiglenn#3350
We're hoping to have some new strategies out soon, difficult to predict future APYs though!

the pop up comes up and the dissappears and i see the tx qued in MM without me signing anything and i get stuck there


[02/21/2022 11:49 PM] MajinBoo#1430
didnt work, but now i split the transaction and it flows. Strange :peepothink:


[02/21/2022 11:52 PM] j.#6352
yea splitting it works too. almost always happens


[02/21/2022 11:53 PM] j.#6352
I also use a Trezor. when i encounter this, i just wait it out. close and reopen browser to refresh Metamask


[02/21/2022 11:54 PM] bbb55555#9330
been trying periodically for a few days now, still can't get it to work... same problem with sushiswap ...is there a way to withdraw from contract?


[02/21/2022 11:55 PM] bbb55555#9330
so frustrating spending hours a week just refreshing MM, going to order a gridplus or something


[02/21/2022 11:56 PM] j.#6352
oh yea i gave up on Sushiswap exactly because of this. I think this is on Metamask's implementation of signing. https://twitter.com/opensea_support/status/1494834637566210049

“Unfortunately, Metamask doesn’t support typed signatures through Trezor yet. This means that if you're a Trezor user, with our new contract you can still log in, move items, fill listings, and accept offers. But you can't list or offer until Metamask rolls out additional support.“
Twitter


[02/21/2022 11:56 PM] j.#6352
It's on Metamask, not Trezor


[02/21/2022 11:56 PM] bbb55555#9330
which is super frustrating, sometimes theres only LIQ on sushi lol, no issues with uniswap at all


[02/21/2022 11:57 PM] j.#6352
Use an aggregator like 1inch or Zapper or Kyber


[02/21/2022 11:57 PM] j.#6352
it should route through Sushiswap if needed


[02/21/2022 11:57 PM] j.#6352
works for me


[02/21/2022 11:58 PM] bbb55555#9330
good idea will try that next time ty, hopefully MM sorts it out so i can withdraw my funds from yearn lol


[02/22/2022 12:14 AM] bbb55555#9330

[02/22/2022 12:26 AM] j.#6352
connect your wallet to zapper.fi


[02/22/2022 12:27 AM] j.#6352
then on the left you'll see a menu item with label *More*. click that. click *Vaults*. you should see your Yearn Vault. click the *minus (-)* symbol to withdraw


[02/22/2022 12:27 AM] bbb55555#9330
ah i see, im using the fantom vaults and it says zapper is not supported yet

Yes, check above link and select your vault on the list on the right (you can CTRL +F it)

Press CTRL + F on your keyboard and type the name of the vault you are looking for. There will be a couple WBTC vaults - your one will be the one with FTM in the name to signify Fantom Network.

[02/23/2022 7:58 AM] Crolev#3404
before you use 1inch check the liquidity


[02/23/2022 7:58 AM] Crolev#3404
it's more likely that you will get a better price by selling yvboost rather than yvecrv


[02/23/2022 7:58 AM] Crolev#3404
and yveCRV is one way vault - you cannot withdraw back to CRV

[02/23/2022 2:45 PM] defiglenn#3350
Hmm, there does seem to be some idle USDC so you should be able to withdraw unless its a huge amount. Can you try removing a few of the decimals at the end when you withdraw?

[02/23/2022 7:06 PM] defiglenn#3350
Yep you can go to yearn.vision , the Share price section , and then on the right hand side select which vault. Then you can see the difference in share price over time, this is the APY if you annualise it

This site is cool. Are you referring to this section? Any idea on how to calculate share price per vault with Web3 queries or an API call? I'm trying to figure out how to do that in realtime and historically, if possible.

You need to click on the vault you want to see on the right, and also change the timeframe at the top


[02/24/2022 12:01 PM] builder25#1469
okay, got it. So am I reading this correctly that yvYFI 0.3.2 hasn't accrued any yield in the past 90D, since the share price hasn't increased at all? is the share price denominated in YFI, in this example? sorry for the noob questions!

[02/24/2022 12:01 PM] defiglenn#3350
yep looks like no yield for YFI last 90 days


[02/24/2022 12:02 PM] defiglenn#3350
Share price is ratio of yvYFI to YFI. It's just useful for tracking the change


[02/24/2022 12:06 PM] builder25#1469
So for yvYFI 0.4.3 vault, the APR could be calculated as (90D window):```In [3]: start_share_price = 1.006528
In [4]: end_share_price = 1.010408
In [5]: (end_share_price - start_share_price) * 4 / start_share_price
Out[5]: 0.015419342531950956```  .... would be about 1.5% APR the past 90D

awesome... thank you for that @defiglenn ... the next step to me is to calculate the share price using smart contract calls... I'm at the same vault now (https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb25cA703181E7484a155DD612b06f57E12Be5F0#readContract, yvYFI 0.4.3).. I see it has a `totalSupply` of YFI of ~1,592 and token is YFI, so I assume that means there's 1,592 YFI in the vault... ```In [6]: 1592420415669058529129 / 10**18
Out[6]: 1592.4204156690585```
... the only missing piece for me is calculating how many shares there are... then you'd have the share price / all the fundamental info needed to make the calculation on your own

You can read about the strategy endorsement process here:
https://medium.com/iearn/how-new-yearn-vault-strategies-are-endorsed-8c0e0870790d

All strategies are forks of repo linked below and are customized to fit the protocol you want to farm. You can read through the code to try to get a gist of it:
https://github.com/yearn/brownie-strategy-mix


[02/24/2022 4:47 PM] naomsa#5548
Awesome! Can I use another toolkit instead of brownie? I'm not really used to it 😅


[02/24/2022 4:48 PM] Crolev#3404
You'd have to ask within the strategist boarding telegram group. Using another toolkit would mean that some other strategist would have to be familiar with it to review your code.

How do I get the price of yearn 3crv tokens?  Was hoping to see at `0x84E13785B5a27879921D6F685f041421C7F482dA` via `pricePerShare` function, which currently gives `1034694051643034849 `.

But this doesn't tie out with zapper, where I see the value of each is `1.05` (see screenshot).  I understand how we get the underlying 3crv price of `1.02` (by taking Curve's `get_virtual_price` call on `0xbEbc44782C7dB0a1A60Cb6fe97d0b483032FF1C7`).  But how does one get `1.05`?

vault tokens' pricepershare is in the value of the vault's underlying token, which in this case is the 3crv LP

[02/25/2022 5:05 PM] Crypt0x#6969
I'm a bit dumb and have an advanced question, so happy to pay anyone that's able to help me (as may take some time). 

Basically I'm trying to judge how different vaults would have performed since e.g July 1 2021, if they started with say 100$, taking into account withdrawals and deposits made along the way (e.g like adding 2$ on September 21st, withdrawing 5$ on October 2, adding 3$ on December 5 etc.) 

To do that (it does'nt have to be super accurate) I need to get the data for how much the vault increased per day. 

Am I right in thinking that this is the data I'm getting from yearn.vision, if I query for

 price per share change 1d annualized-data? So like in attached picture, that's saying that  at 1:00 on 05-15 it was growing at 4.2% annualised, whereas at 05-15 13:00 it was growing at 11.6% annualised? Have I understood that correctly? 


As I said, I'm doing this for a larger project, and if anyone wants to help me and spend a few hours, I'd be v happy to pay dai/eth @ whatever the going rate is for their time, DM's are open

[02/25/2022 6:37 PM] ONI#6888
As for share price the vaults all start at 1.00. So share price at 1.05 would mean over the life time of the vault, the vault has made 5% realized returns up to this time. so if the next day you see share price at 1.06, then that would mean it made 1% in a day in realized after fee yield.


[02/25/2022 6:41 PM] ONI#6888
I would encourage you to pull share price and calculate it manually instead of pull 1d annualized share price. Which dashboard are you pulling this from?

Iron Bank has a dedicated UI (https://app.ib.xyz/) that may help this.

internal RPC error happens on fantom, usually resolved with time (the fantom nodes are doing too much I think.)

I am getting this same error....I also note the APY calc for the yvBoost vault is 0.0%? Are they connected, or is the APY% actually 0? The share price data from yearn.vision says the APY is positive, so I am guessing a UI error? (BTW...yearn.vision is an awesome resource! Thanks!)

Hi everyone. I'm developing for a defi project and I have a question about yearn vault validation. If someone gives me an Ethereum address, how can I confirm that the address belongs to a valid yToken?

I can call `isActive` in the contract to confirm that the vault is active, but that doesn't tell me if the contract I'm interacting with is really a Yearn vault token. Is there a way I can query a list of active vaults or anything like that?

Reposting here from #🏦vaults:

All references to the yearn vault registry have pointed me to this contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ee41c098f9666ed2ea246f4d2558010e59d63a0 but when looking at the list of vaults returned, it does not match up with the list returned from: https://api.yearn.finance/v1/chains/1/vaults/all.

I would think all vaults would still need to be registered on chain and wouldn't be tracked off chain. Is there a v2 registry that I am not seeing, or what am I missing here?

oh wait. it looks older than that. try here https://v1.yearn.finance/vaults

oh wow ok thx

what does this mean when it goes into old vaults


[03/02/2022 2:17 AM] j.#6352
it could be earning nothing


[03/02/2022 2:17 AM] cryptoyid#1682
oh boy ok


[03/02/2022 2:17 AM] cryptoyid#1682
let me try to see it


[03/02/2022 2:19 AM] cryptoyid#1682
balance still shows $0


[03/02/2022 2:20 AM] j.#6352
for both v1 and v2 sites?


[03/02/2022 2:22 AM] cryptoyid#1682
trying now V2 and where would i go to see my balance to withdraw


[03/02/2022 2:22 AM] cryptoyid#1682
i see $0 in holdings


[03/02/2022 2:23 AM] j.#6352
on the vaults page, you should see it immediately. any vault with deposits will be on top


[03/02/2022 2:23 AM] j.#6352
but your vault token is yUSDT and not yvUSDT. we changed vault token names to yv- on v2. so i think you should find yours in v1


[03/02/2022 2:24 AM] cryptoyid#1682
ya V1 looked the most familiar


[03/02/2022 2:24 AM] cryptoyid#1682
there is no vault option there

Hi guys. I have recently added a position in the yvBOOST vault and was just trying to reconcile the difference between the yvBOOST share price on CoinGecko (currently ~ $2.30 https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yvboost) versus that reported on Yearn.Vision (currently $1.4269116). Any help would be much appreciated. thanks!

you are looking at USD price vs share price (price in the value of the vault token's underlying token = yveCRV)

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/05/2022 3:38 AM] j.#6352
1 yvBOOST > 1 yveCRV
Using the numbers in your message above, you can get the amount of yveCRV that the 44295 yvBOOST represents by multiplying 44295 by the share price of yvBOOST at ~1.42 to get yveCRV which is 62097

Yearn publishes their mainnet contract addresses at https://docs.yearn.finance/vaults/yearn-lens/contracts. Does Yearn publish their contract addresses for deployments on other chains, such as Arbitrum and Fantom?

How do you harvest veCRV from yvBOOST? The yearn.finance interface does not show the accruing veCRV or give an option to withdraw the veCRV into ETH, yearn.fi does


[03/06/2022 5:00 PM] yearning#5259
I guess I don't quite understand, but I have yvBOOST and yvCRV, and I can withdaw both of them? Does withdrawing 1 affect the other balance?


[03/06/2022 5:01 PM] Crolev#3404
You can view your yvBOOST as increasing yveCRV in https://v2.yearn.finance/
On the main UI it displays the number of yvBOOST tokens you are holding, but they correspond to growing and growing number of yveCRV tokens.
You cannot 'harvest' veCRV as it's locked for 4 years. You only get more of corresponding yveCRV tokens.


[03/06/2022 5:01 PM] Crolev#3404
Also there is no point in ever withdrawing from yvBOOST anyways since you can just buy and sell it directly on sushiswap

[03/06/2022 5:02 PM] yearning#5259
ah right, yveCRV != veCRV

yearn.fi shows the yveCRV I can withdraw

and v2.yearn.finance/vaults shows withdraw yvBOOST denominated to yveCRV


[03/06/2022 5:03 PM] yearning#5259
I can't withdraw directly to ETH?


[03/06/2022 5:04 PM] Crolev#3404
you can sell your yvBOOST tokens for ETH on sushiswap


[03/06/2022 5:05 PM] yearning#5259
right, but those are not increasing over time with compounding interest


[03/06/2022 5:05 PM] yearning#5259
how would I sell the tokens I am receiving from compounding interest, yveCRV?


[03/06/2022 5:05 PM] yearning#5259
this is good to know, ty


[03/06/2022 5:05 PM] Crolev#3404
yveCRV has less liquidity than yvBOOST


[03/06/2022 5:06 PM] yearning#5259
I'm confused about the reward structure. I thought you bought yvBOOST and you get yveCRV over time as reward, then you could sell off that yveCRV


[03/06/2022 5:06 PM] Crolev#3404
you can redeem your yvBOOST for yveCRV tokens, but it's pointless

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 

[03/06/2022 5:06 PM] Crolev#3404
and it's correct except for the last step which is where you sell yvBOOST rather than yveCRV


[03/06/2022 5:07 PM] yearning#5259
oh ok. so in that case.. it's not that my yvBOOST token _quantity_ is increasing, but their _value_ (from yveCRV) should be increasing over time?


[03/06/2022 5:07 PM] yearning#5259
like if I have 10000 yvBOOST tokens know, and hold them for a year, those yvBOOST tokens will be the same quantity (number unchanging) but hopefully, increasing in value according to the fluctuation of https://yearn.vision/d/CRDOk-UGkkkd/apy-technical?orgId=1 ?


[03/06/2022 5:08 PM] Crolev#3404
yvBOOST tokens quantity will stay constant as those are vault tokens - same like for all the other vaults

{Reactions}

[03/06/2022 5:08 PM] Crolev#3404
however over time yvBOOST share price will grow which means that each yvBOOST will correspond to more yveCRV

however the price is only 1.0948 that of CRV

hi guys, is it possible to withdraw from deprecated vaults? I had left some $hegic in an old vault. If I connect with the wallet holding yvHegic I can see it, but in the withdrawal preview I see the message "ERROR POPULATING TRANSACTION". haven't tried to withdraw yet

How to get out of ibEUR? Where to swap for e.g. ETH?


[03/09/2022 9:02 AM] j.#6352
Long way:
1. Get EUR tokens on Fixed Forex or Sushiswap
2. Deposit EUR tokens in Curve.fi
3. Deposit Curve LP tokens in Yearn Vault

Short way:
1. Given enough liquidity and slippage, Zap from your ETH directly to the Curve ibEUR Vault. Note that this means selling your ETH.


[03/09/2022 9:05 AM] boba#8199
Want to go the other way round. Got ibEUR in the wallet


[03/09/2022 9:06 AM] j.#6352
same steps


[03/09/2022 9:07 AM] j.#6352
you can try to zap with ibEUR, or do the long way


[03/09/2022 9:07 AM] j.#6352
gas would be mostly the same. i personally would do the long way just to be sure


[03/09/2022 9:10 AM] boba#8199
Okay. On the long way, only step 1 is left. No exchange on fixedforex possible (only into other ib-assets)


[03/09/2022 9:11 AM] boba#8199
token not available on sushi


[03/09/2022 9:13 AM] Crolev#3404
It is available - you just need to search using the contract address rather than token name


[03/09/2022 9:17 AM] boba#8199
This is the ibEUR token, right? 0x96E61422b6A9bA0e068B6c5ADd4fFaBC6a4aae27


[03/09/2022 9:17 AM] Crolev#3404
Yep, best to always use Coingecko to find the contract address


[03/09/2022 9:17 AM] Crolev#3404

Sorry for the possibly silly question but what reason might there be for my holdings of yvBOOST to have decreased from 1191 to 996 between December 2021 and February 2022? I don't recall changing anything or selling anything.


[03/09/2022 5:33 PM] Crolev#3404
Older interface displayed the number of underlying yveCRV tokens. Current interface displays the number of yvBOOST tokens you hold.
If you prefer then you can view it in the old way here: https://v2.yearn.finance/


[03/09/2022 5:38 PM] esdmd#8067
ah, thanks...that looks like it's the issue. It makes a little bit easier to track the growth of the holdings


[03/09/2022 5:39 PM] Crolev#3404
Just make sure NOT to withdraw yveCRV from yvBOOST and sell yvBOOST for ETH on sushiswap once you feel that you've waited enough.


[03/09/2022 5:39 PM] Crolev#3404
yvBOOST has more liquidity than yveCRV


[03/09/2022 5:40 PM] Crolev#3404
and frankly you will probably do better by tracking the price of yvBOOST as its own token rather than the growth of underlying yveCRV

[03/09/2022 6:09 PM] esdmd#8067
Sorry for another possibly very dumb but long question, but why are the holdings of pSLPyvBOOST-ETH constant over time on the yearn finance dApp? 

This used to be called just yvBOOST-ETH, but other than the name change, the holdings seems constant (13.79). Am I missing something? 

I did check on the pickle finance dApp, and it seems that the "farms" page shows the backscratcher with the staked 13.79. There is info on the pickle dApp that I don't know what to do with though.  On the "earnings" page, the number of yvBOOST-ETH tokens has increased to 15.18, and on the "farms" page it also seems that I have earned 5.03 pickles (although those 5 pickles aren't reflected on the "dill" page pickle balance).  I don't know what to do with the apparent earnings of 1.39 yvBOOST -ETH tokens and the 5.03 pickles.  

Am I suppose to just let it be, or am I supposed to somehow reinvest the yvBOOST-ETH tokens, or claim the pickle rewards? Is this a better question for the people at Pickle?


[03/09/2022 6:11 PM] esdmd#8067
I guess I sort of "aped" into this vault, without really understanding it or the ramifications.


[03/09/2022 6:14 PM] esdmd#8067
&, on a related topic and likely equally ignorant, how does one go about unwinding this investment? It may be a little bit more complicated than I feel comfortable with.


[03/09/2022 6:28 PM] Crolev#3404
Those are staked sushi pool tokens so you would need to unstake them from Pickle, withdraw liquidity from Sushi and sell half of your tokens (if you want).

{Reactions}
🔥 

[03/09/2022 6:31 PM] Crolev#3404
You should use https://app.pickle.finance/farms as yvBOOST-ETH is not a vault but rather pickled pool tokens.


[03/09/2022 6:31 PM] esdmd#8067
sorry, I think I know what you're referring to, but would you mind clarifying, so I don't make any assumptions as to which tokens you're talking about.


[03/09/2022 6:31 PM] Crolev#3404
In Yearn UI you can just zap into it


[03/09/2022 6:32 PM] Crolev#3404
You asked about unwinding of pSLPyvBOOST-ETH, right?


[03/09/2022 6:33 PM] esdmd#8067
yes. so those are staked sushi pool tokens?


[03/09/2022 6:33 PM] Crolev#3404
To do that you need to withdraw sushi pool tokens from pickle (edit: and also claim pickle rewards), withdraw liquidity from sushi and then sell yvboost for eth (if you want)


[03/09/2022 6:33 PM] Crolev#3404
yes p stands for pickle and SLP stands for Sushi Liquidity Pool


[03/09/2022 6:37 PM] esdmd#8067
ok. thank you, sorry, total amateur here. OK, I think you went to answer the question at the end about "unwinding" first, right? So, if I wanted to "unwind", then I would claim pickle rewards, then withdraw liquidity from sushi, then sell yvBOOST for eth (if I want), correct? Wow, that's a lot to unwind...and I would probably need help to figure out how to do each step. If you wouldn't mind, could you mention what the approach would be with those "earnings" that I mentioned, if I just decide to stay the course for now? It's a little too much to process for unwinding at the moment.

Am I suppose to just let this lab be, or am I supposed to somehow reinvest the yvBOOST-ETH tokens, or actively claim the pickle rewards? What is the end user supposed to do with this particular lab vault? Is there some sort of active participation needed? Is this a better question for the people at Pickle?


[03/10/2022 3:10 PM] Crolev#3404
The Yearn UI shows the number of pickled tokens you have, the Pickle UI shows the number of pool tokens - they are the same thing, just displayed differently. You need to claim the pickle yourself. This is not a Yearn vault. It's a pickle jar - on another protocol. It is in Yearn UI for convenience.

Really though, how many people do you think "fully" understand these things?


[03/10/2022 6:39 PM] esdmd#8067
I think I basically get the idea of it. Where I fell really short in understanding was the practical implementation and the ramifications of having so many transactions going on automatically.


[03/10/2022 6:51 PM] esdmd#8067
Also, really fell short on understanding the implications on how to know if I'm profiting or not. I guess I assumed it would be going up because the growth strategies seem based on sound reasoning and are innovative.


[03/10/2022 6:53 PM] esdmd#8067
At the end of the day it's way above my head, and I should really unwind my positions because I don't quite understand them. And with gas fees as high as they are, I would like to know if I'm breaking even or losing, but really just have no idea how I would compute that.


[03/10/2022 6:54 PM] defiglenn#3350
It is tough to get your head around. Defo think DeFi could improve on making things simpler, especially if we are to onboard more and more TradFi peeps

Not really sure if this is the right channel for it? But wanted to reach out to the team...

I’m Duck Core contributor from Galleon DAO. Yesterday we launched our first main net structured product ETH Max Yield Index ($ETHMAXY) which utilises both stETH from Lido and Aave collateral services. The Index offers 3x+ levered ETH position with 13-15% APY with incredibly low risk. 

Wanted to see if we could potentially open communication with the Yearn team (as we love the protocol) to see if there is any Galleon <> Yearn collaboration opportunities. :pepelove:

I am trying to unwind from yvBOOST. I withdrew from pickle. pickle shows a balance of XX Sushi yvBOOST/ETH available to deposit however this does not show up at all on sushi. I have tried to use Zapper and get an error message. and Zerion sasy no exchanges support this trade. what am I missing here


[03/11/2022 4:03 PM] j.#6352
Withdrawing from the PICKLE farm only unstakes your pSLP. You'll still be in the Pickle platform.You'll have to withdraw from the Jar. You will then have SLP, which you can withdraw to ETH and yvBOOST from Sushiswap

You can also try to use either etherscan to interact with the smart contract directly:
https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2db9a7c0ACd427A680D640F02d90f6186E71725#writeContract

[03/13/2022 1:53 PM] Crolev#3404
But if you don't have enough eth in the wallet then it's a better idea to just top it up

Can someone show me the posted instruction to get this corrected?


[03/16/2022 9:49 PM] defiglenn#3350
Thanks for sharing, seems like a bug with the balance. I will try to find out which one is the correct one. In terms of the APY, we've got an error at the moment and it's not showing but the vault is still earning. You can calculate this on yearn.vision by tracking the change in share price over time


[03/16/2022 10:12 PM] beishan98#0461
the higher one 26,006.7292 is correct


[03/16/2022 10:15 PM] beishan98#0461

The smaller number is yvBOOST and should not change while holding, the bigger number is yvecrv (underlying token for yvBoost) and should grow


[03/16/2022 11:12 PM] beishan98#0461
yvboost number is compounding, should grow over time, right? I saw it grow over time before. I don't think I have any yvecrv.

 12/27  21966


[03/16/2022 11:18 PM] beishan98#0461
they grew before.  But it came down to 17825 when I found it first time on 2/14/2022


[03/16/2022 11:22 PM] beishan98#0461
on "https://v2.yearn.finance/vaults" it has value 26006 on  3/16/2022. On "https://yearn.finance/#/labs" it get stuck at 17825


[03/17/2022 2:40 AM] j.#6352
you have 17825 yvBOOST. 1 yvBOOST is currently ~1.45 yveCRV. The increasing number is the underlying yveCRV.


[03/17/2022 2:41 AM] j.#6352
26k is yveCRV. 17825 is yvBOOST.


[03/17/2022 9:51 AM] Bazza#3684
In the yearn.finance I have yveCRV in my 'holdings' but I don't seem to be able to exit. I can't 'claim' and I can't swap in zapper. How do I exit?


[03/17/2022 9:53 AM] Crolev#3404
You cannot withdraw yveCRV back into CRV because they are locked in forever.


[03/17/2022 9:53 AM] Crolev#3404
You can either sell yveCRV on Sushiswap or deposit back into yvBOOST and sell yvBOOST on Sushiswap


[03/17/2022 9:53 AM] Crolev#3404
the second option is better, because there is more liquidity for yvBOOST than yveCRV

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/17/2022 10:03 AM] beishan98#0461
How do I see the compounding effect, isn't APR reflected in the yvboost number? or it's shown in the yvboost price?


[03/17/2022 10:20 AM] Crolev#3404
one yvboost vault token will be equal to more and more yveCRV tokens over time and this is the compounding effect


[03/17/2022 10:20 AM] Crolev#3404
however this vault is different from others because you cannot withdraw yveCRV into CRV


[03/17/2022 10:21 AM] Crolev#3404
so whether you make or lose when compared against CRV depends on market dynamics - whether yveCRV holds the peg or not

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/17/2022 10:29 AM] beishan98#0461
so yvboost number is fixed, it doesn't grow?


[03/17/2022 10:33 AM] Crolev#3404
No, and neither does the number of any vault tokens. The way Yearn vaults work is that you deposit for a fixed number of vault tokens, but after a longer period of time you will be able to withdraw more than you deposited.
For yvBOOST that's a little different because you cannot withdraw yveCRV back into CRV so instead you trade the yvBOOST/yveCRV tokens directly on Sushiswap (preferably trade yvBOOST because it has more liquidity).

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/17/2022 10:35 AM] beishan98#0461
why my yvboost number stayed at 17825 since 2/14/2022?


[03/17/2022 10:36 AM] Crolev#3404
I just explained


[03/17/2022 10:36 AM] Crolev#3404
this is the number of yvBOOST tokens you hold


[03/17/2022 10:36 AM] Crolev#3404
that number is constant


[03/17/2022 10:36 AM] Crolev#3404
but over time it corresponds to higher and higher number of yveCRV tokens


[03/17/2022 10:36 AM] beishan98#0461
but on 12/27/2021, it was 21966. could  it reduced?


[03/17/2022 10:36 AM] Crolev#3404
nope


[03/17/2022 10:37 AM] Crolev#3404
You can still use older UI to view your yvBOOST as number of underlying yveCRV tokens


[03/17/2022 10:37 AM] Crolev#3404
https://v2.yearn.finance/vaults


[03/17/2022 10:37 AM] Crolev#3404
however it doesn't have any practical difference


[03/17/2022 10:38 AM] Crolev#3404
because if you ever decide that you have held yvBOOST tokens for long enough then there is no point to withdraw yveCRV from it which has little liquidity and it's better to just sell those yvBOOST tokens on Sushi


[03/17/2022 10:39 AM] beishan98#0461
I did buy/sell yvboost at sushi before


[03/17/2022 10:40 AM] Crolev#3404
and that's the preferred way to interact with this particular exceptional vault

[03/17/2022 10:41 AM] beishan98#0461
so my yvboost #  is constant, buy its ratio to yveCRV will incresse from 1.45 to higher value due to compounding effect. so this ratio will never go down, right? does yveCRV value always go up too?


[03/17/2022 10:42 AM] Crolev#3404
>so my yvboost #  is constant, buy its ratio to yveCRV will incresse from 1.45 to higher value due to compounding effect.
Yes.
>so this ratio will never go down, right?
Yes.
>does yveCRV value always go up too?
No. It depends on the value of CRV and the peg ratio of yveCRV to CRV.

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/17/2022 10:43 AM] beishan98#0461
so CRV value can go up and down, so is yveCRV as it's is pegged to it.


[03/17/2022 10:45 AM] Crolev#3404
No. It's the same as cvxCRV. The value of one yveCRV or cvxCRV can be below one CRV, but never above because when it's above then you can just arbitrage it back down by depositing CRV into them.


[03/17/2022 10:45 AM] Crolev#3404
Whether yveCRV is equal to one CRV depends on market dynamics - whether people buy or sell yveCRV or yvBOOST.


[03/17/2022 10:46 AM] Crolev#3404
Currently one yveCRV is worth less than one CRV.

it's probably skewed a little by the most recent harvest because that's a weekly APY

A query. 

From  27/07/21 to 22/01/22 (dates chosen by me, 182 days), I see that the 0.3.0 Dai vault outperformed the 0.4.3 one. 

Judging from TVL , the 0.4.3 is the newer one? As TVL went from 0.3 to 0.4.3. But the old one outperformed over that period. Just wondering if I'm making mistake anywhere in my calcs?

check the strategies of 0.3.0


[03/17/2022 1:32 PM] j.#6352
there should be a router strat which just puts vault funds into 0.4.3


[03/17/2022 1:33 PM] Crypt0x#6969
ah ok, so why would it outperform over a 6 month period?


[03/17/2022 1:33 PM] Crypt0x#6969
old strat seems to have done 0.9% more during that period


[03/17/2022 1:34 PM] j.#6352
weighted, that would also involve the newer 0.4.3

its farming then people move and it harvest so the people who left dont get the harvest rewards?

maybe? This would probably happen as people migrate to the new vault.

Gas limit on the old inferface is "1916686" on the new interface "1277791". So this may the issue?


[03/17/2022 9:11 PM] defiglenn#3350
Old or new interfaces should both work. Maybe you need more Eth in your wallet to pay gas fees

First check the balance of the address you’re connecting to the website in an explorer like etherscan and see which tokens you have in your account


[03/19/2022 8:53 PM] JThC#9484
Thnx for your prompt response. When connecting the ledger it shows several addresses as options, all having a zero eth balance. From what I remember, I deposited stETH coins into the curve vault & paid gas fees obviously in ETH. Does that make any sense?

i accidetially traded for thee wrong. token,.. and it appears to. be some. kind of honeypot?  IDK really... i. can put into. DEX's. and. get a trade. estimate of about. 4.5 ETH -  but i can't trade back to anything leaving me stuck, and out the dough


[03/20/2022 12:11 AM] Jeff C#6504

[03/20/2022 12:15 AM] Jeff C#6504

HMU ... thanks friends...


[03/20/2022 8:23 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
nop it doesn't. Check that the address you deposited with is an option when connecting the ledger, if it doesn't maybe you used a different wallet (for instance used a passphrase with the ledger? )


[03/20/2022 8:25 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
it's very common in scam tokens, you can buy them but later can't sell them back


[03/20/2022 9:08 AM] Jeff C#6504
thanks, yeah, it's a honneypot for sure ...  real bummer,  like everything crypto: we now have learned this lesson. it's funny, had no interest in the thing they are imitating,  have been doing a little trading for fun - find anything that is sort of small cap; with high volume and jump in for a few trades,  kind of half for sport honestly. ....   will be much more careful going forward.     thanks for the replies my friend.

What is a harvest?


[03/22/2022 4:07 PM] ONI#6888
Harvest is when the strategy sells the yield and reinvests it into the vault, increasing the vault's share price


[03/22/2022 9:02 PM] spitsk8r#6395
hey, fairly new to Curve, but I don't understand why there hasn't been a harvest for the `Curve 3Crypto` vault? 

as far as I can tell the last one was on the 3/3: https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/879906686805106698/948716559524827156

only pool this is happening on.  is it mid harvest?


[03/22/2022 10:32 PM] ILWJFTW#8913
Don't mind I latch on this - the total assets staked within this is shown to be "$0" , despite there being a significant amount as per etherscan.  Will the asset staked number be updated only upon harvest too?


[03/22/2022 10:33 PM] ONI#6888
harvest wouldn't stop you from withdrawing. Are you trying to zap out?


[03/22/2022 10:33 PM] ONI#6888
This is an api error that is currently being worked on

Alrightey, thanks for the clarification!


[03/22/2022 10:38 PM] ONI#6888
Does seem like last harvest was almost 3 weeks ago, while it does have a low amount of tvl, gas is cheap so it should be able to be harvested. Thanks for the heads up ill let the strategists know

[03/23/2022 12:08 AM] ONI#6888
you can go to vaults, sort by yearn and look through till you find that vault and zap on zapper.fi

Also, trying to understand this 'deposit opportunity'...In my Wallet, the 'Deposit' button is active for one of my alt-coin holdings and if I click on it, it appears I can deposit into my existing CurveRocketPool vault. Is this right? the alt-coin [xi] is completely unrelated to RocketPool, so I'm confused by this.

my Yearn wallet, that is...


[03/24/2022 3:12 PM] ONI#6888
it allows you to zap any token into any vault via zapper's zaps


[03/24/2022 3:12 PM] ONI#6888
so you would just be selling that asset for the deposit token of the vault, then it would deposit it into the vault. It would compound all yearn in terms of the deposit token. On withdrawal you would get your deposit token + yield gain (as more deposit token), it will not give you back the coin you zapped in.


[03/24/2022 6:23 PM] spitsk8r#6395

so is the 100% slippage on the zap in for the rETH vault incorrect?


[03/25/2022 1:18 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
https://curve.fi/factory/89
this is the factory curve pool. it's currently sitting at 77/22 (usually these pools are more even split) I think this is why we are seeing big slippage in zaps


[03/25/2022 1:26 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Staking in general? or do you have a specific stake you are looking for?
here is a basic article on staking https://medium.com/brandlitic/what-is-crypto-staking-and-how-it-works-explained-2c9c8a3ce87c

Yearn vaults are not staking. We may utilize staking in our strategies though.


[03/25/2022 1:28 PM] Satori#6734
i just mean, the deposit i did, the balance for BOO has stopped accumulating

[03/25/2022 1:35 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
The general idea being when you deposit, you are buying in a certain price per share. That price per share will go up when harvests occur.
So be careful not to assume "value" or "balance" will go up. If the market suddenly drops the value of boo, you would see the value drop (but not balance. balance will remain same, that is your shares.) however, on each harvest, the price per share will increase depending on how profitable the harvest was.
Hopefully this makes sense 😄

Hello Folks 🎉 

I’m helping set up  Yearn Talk’s profile on DAOHQ, a marketplace for finding and joining DAOs. Could you help me with some questions?

Which category does your token right fit into?
a) Governance token right: This gives access to make decision in DAOs which includes governance, block creation & contribution

b) Transactional Token right: This gives access to make transactions, make payment, earn profit or revenue.


[03/26/2022 3:27 AM] Yash | DAOs#8247

[03/26/2022 9:40 AM] Yash | DAOs#8247
Do you use any other token except  YFI?


[03/26/2022 9:42 AM] Crolev#3404
there is also WOOFY token that is a wrapped YFI denominated times 1 000 000 and there's a YFI vault. Technically also all vaults are tokens on their own.


[03/26/2022 9:43 AM] Yash | DAOs#8247
Okay, dose other token have governance right? Or they are kind of liquidity assets only?


[03/26/2022 9:49 AM] Crolev#3404
at the moment only YFI and yvYFI vault have governance rights

It seems that something broke in the backend - the amount earned is still growing, but it's not showing correctly on the frontend
In the meanwhile I recommend using yearn.vision to view the growth of share price:
https://yearn.vision/?orgId=1&refresh=1m&viewPanel=24&from=now-7d&to=now


[03/26/2022 11:10 AM] Crolev#3404
your amount earned is the difference between the share price right now and the share price at the time of deposit times the amount of vault tokens

[03/27/2022 7:28 AM] j.#6352
no one knows. depends on user deposits (or price) on Curve. see here: https://curve.fi/factory/89


[03/27/2022 8:44 AM] ETfromJ#6667
Couldn’t find the pinned tab on the subject, is it pinned in this channel? I just deposited into the vault but the front end doesn’t show any value or APY, is everything alright? Do I need to be worried? When will this vault show up normally?
Thanks a lot 🙏🏻 I’m sure this has been asked before, so if someone can also just tag the reply.

Sorry my bad. Is the vault up and running and earning rewards? Where can I see that? Thanks for the help!


[03/27/2022 9:21 AM] j.#6352
All vaults listed on the yearn.finance website is live and in production. So if a vault is listed, yes it's up and running and earning rewards. Here's the strategy attached to the vault: https://yearn.watch/network/ethereum/vault/0x5c0A86A32c129538D62C106Eb8115a8b02358d57/strategy/0x36cd87a3231b3fefc6c398746c90bc22e56077df


[03/27/2022 9:22 AM] j.#6352
It looks like it has three profitable harvests so far at about 6% annualized each. Minus fees, that should be about 3% APY

This is not the place for that question. Anyway, you either approved a malicious contract or your address is compromised or maybe it's a function in the nft

You can only do so much with ~$16M and there's not a lot of massive yield for (W)ETH unless you go full degen anyway

the yield is distributed as share price growth after each harvest


[04/02/2022 7:57 PM] Crolev#3404
this means that one vault token corresponds to more than one underlying token


[04/02/2022 7:57 PM] Crolev#3404
so even if you see 50 less tokens in your wallets then they correspond to the same amount of tokens you have initially deposited


[04/02/2022 7:59 PM] rocoloco64#9212
okay. is fantom low gas network? cause then harvest shoukd already happen in the last 24 hrs


[04/02/2022 8:04 PM] Crolev#3404
It varies from vault to vault. This particular one seems to get harvested once or twice per week:

OK thanks - so where do you stake YFI tokens post new tokenomics vote, to participate in governance and earn more YFI? Not V2 staking?


[04/04/2022 4:50 AM] j.#6352
You can participate in governance with plain YFI and YFI in vaults or LPs. You can earn more YFI in the YFI vaults on Ethereum or Fantom.

[04/06/2022 1:40 AM] j.#6352
not all of the vault's funds are in one farm. there are multiple strategies attached to the WFTM vault currently


[04/06/2022 9:25 AM] 大山PJ#7237
Is the website down?


[04/06/2022 10:24 AM] j.#6352
looks like it is


[04/06/2022 10:27 AM] Jeff C#6504
hey thank you


[04/06/2022 10:27 AM] Jeff C#6504
so, have you ever seen an exploit situation with strange entires in transaction receipt event logs?


[04/06/2022 10:28 AM] j.#6352
If i remember right, Metamask only logs events locally for that specific browser


[04/06/2022 10:28 AM] Jeff C#6504
ok, interesting


[04/06/2022 10:29 AM] Jeff C#6504
certainly seems to be something up;  odd losses;  and seeing these log entries,  have changed wallets, and revoked permissions on all smart contracts..


[04/06/2022 10:29 AM] j.#6352
my Metamask logs dont match between two browsers i use it on with the same address


[04/06/2022 10:29 AM] j.#6352
smart move


[04/06/2022 10:29 AM] Jeff C#6504
ok- these are on etherscsan


[04/06/2022 10:29 AM] j.#6352
if theyre on etherscan then they definitely happened


[04/06/2022 10:29 AM] Jeff C#6504
well FTMscan in this case


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] j.#6352
if you dont recognize them, that address is compromised or some approvals may be malicious or both


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] Jeff C#6504
yeah - i don't know a ton about reading them - but it looks like these TXs go to another wallet, and back it's very odd


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] j.#6352
but good move on revoking and moving


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] Jeff C#6504
ok, it seemed to follow me to the new wallet


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] j.#6352
how so?


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] j.#6352
that's the strange part


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] Jeff C#6504
feels like these creazy pills are getting to me...
it's still doing it now


[04/06/2022 10:30 AM] Jeff C#6504
i moved everything, ran a test, and it's doing it again


[04/06/2022 10:31 AM] j.#6352
did you do anything in the new address?


[04/06/2022 10:31 AM] j.#6352
wait maybe your system is what's compromised


[04/06/2022 10:31 AM] Jeff C#6504
yeah - i tested one TX on spookswap  -


[04/06/2022 10:31 AM] Jeff C#6504
right could be?  i'm pretty careful but yeah


[04/06/2022 10:31 AM] j.#6352
what happens? does it instasend tokens to a different address?


[04/06/2022 10:32 AM] Jeff C#6504
can i send you a log


[04/06/2022 10:32 AM] j.#6352
sure. send me both addresses if you can


[04/06/2022 10:32 AM] Jeff C#6504
i don't know if i am reading this wrong


[04/06/2022 10:32 AM] j.#6352
i'll delete them after i get them


[04/06/2022 10:32 AM] Jeff C#6504
cool, ty


[04/06/2022 10:33 AM] j.#6352
*moved to DM*


[04/06/2022 11:38 AM] Kaido.comb#6463
obviously there's issue with yfi, scream has at least 3.5% apr and Iron bank 4.11% apr on wftm


[04/06/2022 12:27 PM] kx9x#3778
I don't think yearn could magically move all its WFTM into scream or iron bank and have the interest rates just magically not change haha. That's not how those markets work


[04/06/2022 12:28 PM] kx9x#3778
It would kinda suck bad if borrowers still had to pay high rates if someone just supplied a metric fuck ton extra supply


[04/06/2022 12:40 PM] j.#6352
*Translation: big capital = diluted and lower yield*


[04/06/2022 2:13 PM] Kaido.comb#6463
so it's best to put our wftm directly into scream or iron bank  ✅


[04/06/2022 2:17 PM] j.#6352
yes


[04/07/2022 12:57 PM] Marek K#4138
Hi, everyone!

Great to see that yearn has a great community. I just got into yearn and I have some fundamental questions to ask. If there are experienced users/smart guys here, lets talk. I checked the vaults and my question is following:
- Why should anyone deposit ETH into 5% APY Curve stETH vault if the gas fee of the initial deposit eats the APY? Example: I want to deposit 2k$ worth of ETH to Curve stETH and the deposit gas fee is approximately 100$. Given the APY, the 2k deposit would earn me 100$. Where is the catch?


[04/07/2022 12:59 PM] Crolev#3404
There's no catch, it's just that Ethereum is not good anymore for users with less than six figure portfolio. Try using Yearn on Fantom or Arbitrum or via Argent Wallet for lower gas fees.


[04/07/2022 1:00 PM] Crolev#3404
Of course each network has different vaults and that particular vault seems to be only on Ethereum.


[04/07/2022 1:04 PM] Marek K#4138
Good to know.


[04/07/2022 1:04 PM] Marek K#4138
Thanks.


[04/07/2022 1:12 PM] Marek K#4138
Rookie question, but what would be the suggestion how should I do if I would like to convert some of the ETH to Fantom?


[04/07/2022 1:12 PM] Marek K#4138
most cost-effective


[04/07/2022 1:14 PM] Crolev#3404
Most cost effective is depositing eth back to a crypto exchange, selling eth to buy ftm and withdrawing ftm to Fantom.


[04/07/2022 3:41 PM] bfs#7030
i think they mean moving ETH to the fantom network


[04/07/2022 3:41 PM] bfs#7030
if so, then multichain.org is the main fantom bridge


[04/07/2022 3:42 PM] Marek K#4138
correct


[04/07/2022 3:43 PM] bfs#7030
you will also need FTM coin to pay for gas though


[04/07/2022 4:00 PM] Crolev#3404
With $2k of funds it's more worth it to use a crypto exchange to buy FTM and then maybe buy WETH on Fantom chain.


[04/08/2022 10:35 AM] MCbobi#0648
hello. I try to withdraw from ETH vault on ETH but can't. Idk why

[04/08/2022 4:53 PM] Guy G#6311
Hi! I have a question I need help with re:  Yearn.Finance vaults


[04/08/2022 4:56 PM] Guy G#6311
6+ months ago i invested in two Yearn vaults (DAI and USDC v2);  About 3 months ago i liquidated my DAI vault;  I now want to liquidate my USDC v2 vault;  my Ledger has the right amount of yvUSDC on it (i can see as a hidden asset), but when i connect my Ledger wallet to the Yearn.Finance DAPP, it doesn't see anything in that vault.  How can I get to it?


[04/08/2022 4:58 PM] Crolev#3404
Check if you can you see your funds here:
https://v2.yearn.finance/
It's the older version of the UI.


[04/08/2022 5:00 PM] Guy G#6311
I just tried v2.yearn.finance - nothing there


[04/08/2022 5:00 PM] Guy G#6311
when i connect my wallet it asks which account to connect to - all have 0 balance


[04/08/2022 5:00 PM] Guy G#6311
My tax software (Koinly) sees the yvUSDC on my Ledger


[04/08/2022 5:08 PM] Crolev#3404
do you see it if you check your address on etherscan?


[04/08/2022 5:08 PM] Crolev#3404
also check also the even older UI: https://v1.yearn.finance/vaults


[04/08/2022 5:10 PM] Guy G#6311
i can't get the v1 to connect to my ledger wallet - odd


[04/08/2022 5:10 PM] Guy G#6311
how do i check etherscan?


[04/08/2022 5:12 PM] ChrisP#9029
hi i was looking at yearn finance website and in the vault section when you click on a specific vault to deposit for example usdt vault it says strategies is that what the protocol is doing for me in the vault when i deposit or is that just some tips that i can do ? @Crolev


[04/08/2022 5:13 PM] Crolev#3404
Copy your Ethereum address and paste it into the last part of this URL: https://etherscan.io/address/YOUR_ADDRESS


[04/08/2022 5:14 PM] Crolev#3404
This is just information for you. When you deposit into a vault you get exposure to all active strategies at the given moment.


[04/08/2022 5:15 PM] ChrisP#9029
ok so its just information that i can do with after depositing into the vault


[04/08/2022 5:16 PM] Guy G#6311
thanks for your help;  i searched etherscan with the ETH address


[04/08/2022 5:16 PM] Guy G#6311
i see the yvUSDC there


[04/08/2022 5:17 PM] Guy G#6311
how do i get access to that to convert it to USDC


[04/08/2022 5:17 PM] Crolev#3404
Yes, but you should be able to see it also in the UI. Could you please click on the token on etherscan and paste here the contract address so I can check which vault this is?


[04/08/2022 5:19 PM] Guy G#6311
i'm not that experienced here and am not comfortable pasting in info


[04/08/2022 5:19 PM] Guy G#6311
is there a way i can check? i really do appreciate your help


[04/08/2022 5:25 PM] Crolev#3404
https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0xa354F35829Ae975e850e23e9615b11Da1B3dC4DE


[04/08/2022 5:26 PM] Crolev#3404
The contract address for current yvUSDC is 0xa354F35829Ae975e850e23e9615b11Da1B3dC4DE as you can see in the URL.


[04/08/2022 5:26 PM] Crolev#3404
The tokens you hold should have the same contract address if they are from the same vault - if not then it's probably some older one.


[04/08/2022 5:28 PM] Guy G#6311
my address is different  ends in 73a9


[04/08/2022 5:29 PM] Guy G#6311
it is USDC yVault v2


[04/08/2022 5:32 PM] Crolev#3404
just to be clear - I'm not asking about your address, but the address of the vault token


[04/08/2022 5:32 PM] Crolev#3404
it is public and the same for everyone so you can just paste it


[04/08/2022 5:48 PM] coolboy#2462
how can I convert crvCVXCRV to eth


[04/08/2022 5:58 PM] Guy G#6311
tell me more; i want to make sure it's kosher to give the vault token address ... what do you do with it?


[04/08/2022 6:03 PM] Guy G#6311
i searched etherscan for yvUSDC and the first contract address is the one i have

again appreciate the help; i'll be off/on the discord over weekend; i'd be curious about your thoughts on how to recover the value in this contract?


[04/08/2022 6:11 PM] Crolev#3404
Would you mind DMing me your eth address? I'll just check it for you and reply in this channel.


[04/08/2022 6:30 PM] Guy G#6311

[04/08/2022 8:17 PM] bfs#7030

[04/08/2022 8:31 PM] bfs#7030
we're asking for the vault address because it seems like you've deposited in a vault that is depreciated. there are alternate user interfaces to withdrawl from those vaults, but if we don't know how old the vault is, there's no way of telling how to safely withdraw from it


[04/08/2022 10:49 PM] Guy G#6311
this is my vault address:   0x5f18C75AbDAe578b483E5F43f12a39cF75b973a9


[04/08/2022 10:49 PM] Guy G#6311
i appreciate the explaination, just being cautious


[04/08/2022 11:05 PM] Guy G#6311
i just found the vault is a retired vault  yvUSDC 0.3.0


[04/09/2022 12:05 AM] j.#6352
0.3.0 USDC should be visible in the v2 site


[04/09/2022 12:06 AM] j.#6352
you can also try to use Zapper.fi. connect your wallet and it should detect your old yvUSDC. you should be able to withdraw from there too


[04/09/2022 1:03 AM] Guy G#6311
can you point me to documentation on how to do that on Zapper.fi?  appreciate it

WHen i connect my ledger wallet to either v1/v2.yearn.finance or zapper; it asks for derivation path - i choose the one i've always used; then it prompts me for an account - all choices have 0 ETH balance; how do i know which account to use?  my ledger live shows non zero assets on my ledger


[04/09/2022 1:12 PM] j.#6352
click around and try a different deriv path to find your 0x address


[04/09/2022 6:55 PM] Guy G#6311
making progress: played around with derivation path (thx for this advice) and found on zapper the account with yvUSDC;  now how do i swap that for USDC and get my crypto out of the yearn vault?


[04/09/2022 8:45 PM] j.#6352
On the menu on the left, click Invest, then click Vaults. you should see your USDC Vault. Click the minus (-) symbol to withdraw


[04/09/2022 8:45 PM] j.#6352
or check the Zapper docs i linked earlier


[04/10/2022 7:42 AM] Polulk the mage 🪄#4821
Hey, so I'd like to deposit some liquidity to the rocket pool vault but logistically I'm not sure how this is supposed to work


[04/10/2022 7:42 AM] Polulk the mage 🪄#4821
Am I supposed to deposit the wsteth and reth directly through yearn?


[04/10/2022 7:52 AM] Crolev#3404
There are two options:
One is to zap into the vault. It uses the zapper.fi API to trade the token you selected into the token you need to deposit and then it deposits that token into the vault. (Demonstrated on the screenshot)

Second option is to do all the steps yourself: buy rETH and or wstETH and stake it into Curve pool here: https://curve.fi/factory/89/deposit and then deposit the pool tokens into Yearn vault.

Ahh brilliant thank you


[04/10/2022 7:57 AM] Polulk the mage 🪄#4821
I’m assuming that depositing directly to curve will probably be more efficient if I’m holding the tokens directly?


[04/10/2022 7:59 AM] Crolev#3404
It depends on the current gas prices. Right now you probably will be better off doing it yourself, because gas fees are low.


[04/10/2022 8:12 AM] Polulk the mage 🪄#4821
Thanks @Crolev


[04/10/2022 8:12 AM] Polulk the mage 🪄#4821
How should I think about the risk of depositing through yearn? I’m exposed to smart contract risk of both curve and yearn?


[04/10/2022 8:16 AM] Crolev#3404
Yep. You should read those articles:
https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/risks/protocol-risks
https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/risks/strategy-risks
https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/risks/vault-risks


[04/10/2022 8:16 AM] Crolev#3404
You are also trusting that the smart contracts of the underlying tokens are also correct

Cool - thank you mate


[04/10/2022 11:14 AM] Prince Tok#9197
With low gas better to go through curve first.  Also when you zap you get slippage

Hi any information here?  Net APY definitely looks too low.  Also quick question how long does it take a new strategy to get an APY instead of "New."  Thanks!


[04/11/2022 10:24 PM] ONI#6888
A new strategy generally take 2 to 3 harvests which can take a while up to 2 or 3 weeks sometimes

so it's actually the yvWFTM that you're seeing when you go to yearn and not your original deposit


[04/12/2022 9:58 AM] j.#6352
you should see the WFTM under the *balance* column, not yvWFTM

hi, im having an issue with this as well, using brave and chrome both just gives me a blurred page. anyone found out the culprit?


[04/12/2022 12:30 PM] Prince Tok#9197
where can I find harvest information for different pools?  Specifically interested in the new cvx/eth strategy.  

Also after those first few harvest generally how often do harvests happen afterward? 

thanks for your help ser!

Will token 4626 be supported on all vaults and chains?


[04/12/2022 12:34 PM] visioneum#5053

https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdffd/vault-overview?orgId=1 select your vault and go to the harvest section here

Hi there, new to Yearn, I've deposited some WFTM into Vault since about a couple days ago, and I can see my balance on the vault page. However, I can't seem to see anything on my dashboard (Holding and Earn both show 0), can you please help? Not sure if I missed a step to complete the deposit. Thanks


[04/13/2022 6:09 PM] tbrent#8288
What's the best way to withdraw from the yvWETH vault at the moment? 

yearn.finance uses the Zapper API on the backend, which seems to be broken. I get a 500 Error. I get a similar error when I use the Zapper UI directly. 

I'm technical and down to interact directly with smart contracts.


[04/13/2022 6:26 PM] Crolev#3404
Try to withdraw to WETH and then unwrap it using Uniswap


[04/13/2022 6:29 PM] Maverik#5830
I currently have my CRV in the CRVETH pool on Curve.Fi, however I stumbled upon Yearn and see that I'm able to deposit crvCRVETH into this vault Curve CRV-ETH Pool yVault (Curve CRV-ETH). Isn't this like double staking? I'm a bit confused as why I'm allowed to do this and trying to understand more. Thanks.


[04/13/2022 6:30 PM] tbrent#8288
That worked, thank you!


[04/13/2022 6:34 PM] Crolev#3404
The vault is for the pool tokens so you can go ahead and put them in the vault and it will earn the gauge rewards, sell it for you and buy more pool tokens with it.

You should make sure that you understand what you are putting your money into though. If you put your CRV into CRV-ETH pool then you effectively sold half of your CRV for ETH and you have 50:50 exposure to CRV and ETH plus lp rewards.

If you want to compound just your CRV then look into yvBOOST instead (https://medium.com/iearn/thats-boost-folks-7afae75db826). If you do decide to use yvBOOST then make sure to trade CRV -> WETH -> yvBOOST directly on Sushiswap rather than depositing CRV -> yveCRV -> yvBOOST, because you will get more tokens via Sushiswap while yveCRV is below CRV peg.

Then there is nothing to withdraw


[04/14/2022 3:44 PM] j.#6352
having yvWFTM means you have a deposit in the WFTM vault

[04/15/2022 11:02 PM] j.#6352
yes pick that one, then withdraw. after that, withdraw from Curve, then you can sell the CVX and/or CRV on your favorite DEX


[04/15/2022 11:04 PM] Princeps#4984
So I have Curve cvxCRV how to I change it to Curve ?

After withdrawing Curve cvxcrv LP from the vault, withdraw CVX and/or CRV from Curve


[04/15/2022 11:07 PM] Princeps#4984
Are you can see above, I have Curve cvxCRV available, so it doesn't make sense to deposit just to withdraw it back to Curve cvxCRV just to change it to Curve. So I'm just stuck with Curve cvxCRV right now on my wallet. it's not deposited


[04/15/2022 11:07 PM] Princeps#4984
I'll try increasing the slippage


[04/15/2022 11:07 PM] j.#6352
Then skip the bit i mentioned about the vault then go straight to Curve and withdraw from there

I mentioned no deposit


[04/15/2022 11:11 PM] Princeps#4984
Thanks for the help so far, I feel dumb but IDK how to ***go straight to Curve*** ? Link me to something that educates me into a literate degen or where I can do this, cause I'm hella confused on how or where to change Curve cvxCRV to Curve.


[04/15/2022 11:11 PM] j.#6352
curve.fi


[04/15/2022 11:12 PM] j.#6352
you should see the list of pools on the main page


[04/15/2022 11:12 PM] j.#6352
you can find cvxcrv there


[04/15/2022 11:12 PM] j.#6352
click that, then when it takes you to the pool's page, click withdraw on the menu bar on the top of the page


[04/15/2022 11:34 PM] Princeps#4984

Hey all, having an issue with depositing into Curve Tricrypto pool on Arbitrum. I have the crv3crypto tokens in my wallet, and it shows up in the UI, but the received amount of vault tokens shows up in red. I have the option to approve, which I did (twice) and they were successful, but not able to deposit. I tried a few different amounts but same issue each time.

Also have this error message in yellow showing, not sure if that is part of any issue

do you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for the transaction?


[04/18/2022 12:03 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Were you able to get this tx done?

That yellow section is our simulation, unfortunately we haven't cleaned that particular error up yet, but that section should provide you a more human readable error.
Were you able to get this done korch?

Is it safe to just call `withdrawAll` on the contract on Etherscan?


[04/18/2022 2:28 PM] k0rch#1823
Sorry, realized I was not in the channel anymore and came back in


[04/18/2022 2:28 PM] k0rch#1823
I should have enough aETH yeah, it doesn't even allow me to try to approve the deposit transaction (which even if I didn't have enough it _should_ at least open the prompt right?)


[04/18/2022 2:30 PM] k0rch#1823
Tried again just in case, issue remains where approval doesn't change the UI to allow me to even try to deposit


[04/18/2022 2:32 PM] k0rch#1823
Have about 5 USD of aETH for gas which on L2 should be way more than enough


[04/18/2022 2:35 PM] k0rch#1823
Ah! Got it to work, but only from the Portfolio page -> pressing "deposit" on the relevant asset row. So I think it is a UI issue on the main vault page that I screenshotted from.

Hello, the APY for the crypto asset has been decreased, I would like to withdraw from the vault, but then I try to do it it gives me the following error message: ERROR POPULATING TRANSACTION


[04/19/2022 9:13 AM] Crolev#3404
Which vault on which network are you trying to withdraw from?


[04/19/2022 9:31 AM] artu#1404
Hey guys, what is the governance token address?


[04/19/2022 9:33 AM] Crolev#3404
https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yearn-finance
Click on etherscan on coingecko - it will take you to the contract address of YFI token.

Unless you meant you wanted to check treasury addresses - then take a look at this:
https://openorgs.info/organization/yearn


[04/19/2022 9:47 AM] artu#1404
tks mate, also, what is the onchain voting contract? cuz the abi just have approve and transfer


[04/19/2022 9:52 AM] Crolev#3404
The votes are done via snapshot - for example https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth/proposal/0x8f7417fa5565d9f46e16618503e8808c36d51b2a9e8217a68c632d7c090d69d9
And then if executing a successful proposal requires something from multisig treasury address then following people have to sign the transaction: https://docs.yearn.finance/security/multisig


[04/19/2022 9:56 AM] artu#1404
oh okay, tks a lot mate

By what standard was the initial 30,000 tokens obtained? Now how can I get tokens other than buying them from someone else?Do you officially publish the criteria for distributing tokens on your website? Please help me！


[04/20/2022 8:58 AM] Crolev#3404
Some of the initial tokens were distributed to the contributors and some where farmed. That was back in 2020 and there will be no more emissions for farming purposes. The only ways to obtain YFI are buying it from the market and contributing to Yearn to receive a YFI reward.


[04/20/2022 9:06 AM] jiaerw38#3458
Do you know how many contributions were made to get the initial tokens?


[04/20/2022 10:34 AM] ONI#6888
so 30k tokens were released over 2 weeks and that was it (not for contributors just liquidity mining, if you were in those pools / staked then you got yfi), then we minted 6666 if I remember correctly and 1/3 was given to contributors. Now we slowly are giving the rest out to contributors


[04/20/2022 11:31 AM] Worms#0026
If you'd like to learn more we are just posting on our blog about governance this week: https://blog.yearn.finance/articles/marco-worms/yearn-governance

There is a section (one of the last ones) on "how YFI was fair launched" and I've linked the early medium posts used to distribute yfi, you can dig there more info! 30,000 yfi was progressively minted at launch 

If you sum those posts with this proposal that minted more 6,666 tokens https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-57-funding-yearns-future/9319 you'll see how all 36,666 got minted 😄

Hi, I'm Srijith over from Questbook (YC 21) a grants orchestration tool to help any grants team run their grants program seamlessly (we're partners with Polygon, Ocean, Aave, Harmony and Solana),

I was hoping to get in touch with someone in the Yearn team to talk to about a potential partnership through our grants platform, glad to do a demo call, anyone I should look at approaching? 

Apologies if this isn't the right place.

[04/21/2022 4:55 PM] Crolev#3404
Unfortunately it's a backend issue that causes those values not to display properly. It might take a while to fix so in the meanwhile you can just remember that you initially deposited 12,530.97 FTM so any amount above that in the column Balance is your profit. Right now in balance you have 12,572.43 FTM which means that more than 41 FTM was earned since you deposited 8 days ago.


[04/21/2022 5:12 PM] PartyStarter-#3732
Ok got it thanks so I leave everything where it is 
Thanks for the help 
Do you know when the backend problem will be fixed ?

Unfortunately it's hard to tell when it might get fixed.


[04/21/2022 5:25 PM] Crolev#3404
It's dependent on an issue with the Fantom client. You can track the bug there: https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/go-opera/issues/288

You can make a mock withdrawal with you max amount to see how much WFTM you get. You can also check more data here https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdffd/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=FTM&var-vaults=yvWFTM+0.4.3

Thank you a lot! 🙂


[04/25/2022 7:03 AM] Crolev#3404
Did you manually interact with the smart contract on etherscan or manually typed the amount you want to withdraw somewhere? I see that this transaction is failing because you are trying to redeem more vault tokens than you actually have on your address.

Try this:
Go to https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0xF29AE508698bDeF169B89834F76704C3B205aedf
Click on withdraw on the right.
Click on the [max] button to withdraw everything and click on withdraw button at the bottom of the form.

Do you have enough eth on your address to pay for the gas for the transaction? You should have at least 0.1 eth to be able to freely transact without risking gas running out.


[04/25/2022 12:12 PM] AltcoinMo#7176
Yes have more than enough ETH

totalSupply is the total yvDAI

[04/26/2022 12:01 AM] kx9x#3778
that is an ERC20 function


[04/26/2022 12:01 AM] tdm#4189
right and what is shares in this case?


[04/26/2022 12:01 AM] kx9x#3778
that looks like the withdrawal function, but cannot fully tell. shares is some variable in that function


[04/26/2022 12:01 AM] tdm#4189
ok ty sir


[04/26/2022 12:01 AM] kx9x#3778
if it is withdraw, then shares is the amount of yvDAI being withdrawn


[04/26/2022 12:02 AM] ONI#6888
Are you building a protocol or script to use the vault contract?


[04/26/2022 12:02 AM] tdm#4189

not really an oracle

yah it just uses that afaik though im not super well versed on it. I know we dont use an oracle afaik.


[04/26/2022 5:08 AM] Crolev#3404
Unfortunately there's a backend problem related to a bug in official Fantom client that prevents correctly displaying some data.
In the meanwhile you can check on ftmscan how much wftm did you deposit. The difference between your current balance and your wftm deposit is your yield.

[04/27/2022 1:54 PM] Matanzas#4840
Hi I have some crvRETHwstETH tokens.  What's the best way to swap/withdraw them back to ETH?   Thanks!


[04/27/2022 1:55 PM] Crolev#3404
yes, although there is only one vault on Arbitrum at the moment


[04/27/2022 1:58 PM] Crolev#3404
Easy path that might not work is trying to zap them into eth via zapper (you can try both on yearn.finance and on zapper.fi), but it doesn't always work or there might be high slippage.

The full path is to withdraw curve pool tokens on yearn.finance, then withdraw underlying tokens on curve.fi (you can withdraw as 50:50 rETH and wstETH or 100% in either one - you should check which one is the most financially viable) and trade them to eth.


[04/27/2022 1:59 PM] Crolev#3404
For example the full path can be: 1. withdraw your tokens from vault (if you haven't already); 2. withdraw them as wstETH on curve.fi and 3. trade wstETH to ETH on uniswap.


[04/27/2022 2:18 PM] Matanzas#4840
OK thanks.  Yeah I've withdrawn them from the vault.  On curve, it's showing that I've got rETH: 4.67  and  wstETH: 1.39.    And the equivalent is 6.12 rETH because of a bonus.   I get a red warning on wstETH.   So I guess next step is to choose rETH, right?   And that'll convert to ETH?

[04/27/2022 10:43 PM] jiaerw38#3458
Looking for help. Is there a management fee charged regardless of whether it is profitable or not? Is this fee charged when the money is withdrawn?


[04/27/2022 10:45 PM] j.#6352
The management fee is applied over a year. so the 2% is not on withdrawal but shared throughout a year. It's an annualized fee. I think current vaults adapt to fees with low enough profitability if i remember right. not sure if it's automatic or manually set


[04/27/2022 11:00 PM] jiaerw38#3458
That is, if my money is less than one year, is the management fee charged for one year?


[04/27/2022 11:02 PM] j.#6352
annualized fee. it's shared throughout the year as mentioned above. an example for a daily reduction would be 2%/365 = daily fee


[04/27/2022 11:02 PM] j.#6352
the 2% is spread/distributed/taken/shared over the whole year


[04/28/2022 12:00 AM] jiaerw38#3458
ok，thanks

Click on the green address under Burnt. It should take you to the Etherscan page of the YFI token transfers. You'll see that the transactions listed are addresses sending/transferring YFI to the same contract address


[04/29/2022 2:59 AM] j.#6352
You probably have heard stories of people sending tokens to the token's contract address by mistake, then find out later that those tokens can't be retrieved. this is that same situation

Hi Team did a deposit (Zap in) of ETH for yvBOOST.  Token amount is not showing in metamask.  The contract in etherscan is 0x8e52522e6a77578904ddd7f528a22521dc4154f5  Anything I need to do to get the token amount to show?  Did I execute correctly?

yvBOOST is 0x9d409a0A012CFbA9B15F6D4B36Ac57A46966Ab9a


[04/29/2022 10:31 PM] dg#9031
That was my concern when I checked the contract.  I did it via deposit in the Labs section https://yearn.finance/#/labs 1. Selected ETH after clicking deposit. 2. adjusted some parameters in metamask to reduce gas.  3. Entered custom token address in metamask ...4f5.  Using ethplorer.io contract comes up as yvCurve-CVXETH


[04/29/2022 10:33 PM] dg#9031

if your tx succeeded then theres nothing else to do. im just telling you the token contract address for yvBOOST which you have to add to your metamask


[04/29/2022 11:00 PM] j.#6352
it sounds like you havent replaced/removed 0x8e5 for 0x9d4 yet


[04/29/2022 11:00 PM] j.#6352

[04/29/2022 11:09 PM] dg#9031
"it sounds like you havent replaced/removed 0x8e5 for 0x9d4 yet" I assume this is an automated step that has failed.  What steps can I take to ensure I receive yvBoost or recover my ETH?


[04/29/2022 11:24 PM] j.#6352
nope. custom token additions on metamask are done manually

[04/30/2022 12:41 PM] arberx#3367
Try a different ftm rpc


[04/30/2022 12:44 PM] NFTboi#9635
how do i do this?


[04/30/2022 12:45 PM] NFTboi#9635
@arberx


[04/30/2022 12:46 PM] arberx#3367
I linked u a site, click fantom and choose a different rpc


[04/30/2022 12:46 PM] arberx#3367
Then on metamask


[04/30/2022 12:46 PM] arberx#3367
Change it


[04/30/2022 12:55 PM] NFTboi#9635
do i have to mannually copy paste the new rpc?


[04/30/2022 12:58 PM] NFTboi#9635
is the chain id stilll id


[04/30/2022 12:58 PM] arberx#3367
Yes


[04/30/2022 12:58 PM] arberx#3367
Chain id is the same

getting these errors


[04/30/2022 1:00 PM] NFTboi#9635
this isnt an issue right @arberx


[04/30/2022 1:00 PM] NFTboi#9635
sorry i mainly just use the mainnet


[04/30/2022 1:01 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
you need to modify the RPC of the fantom network you already have, not adding another network


[04/30/2022 1:02 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
go to settings, networks and change the RPC of the fantom one


[04/30/2022 1:03 PM] kx9x#3778
that error is benign, you can totally add 2 networks with the same chain id


[04/30/2022 1:03 PM] arberx#3367
That’s not a error


[04/30/2022 1:03 PM] arberx#3367
Just a warning


[04/30/2022 1:03 PM] kx9x#3778
just ignore and save


[04/30/2022 1:03 PM] arberx#3367
You can still click save


[04/30/2022 1:03 PM] arberx#3367
Yeah


[04/30/2022 1:03 PM] kx9x#3778
they need to remove the red border, it should be yellow

if you deposit curve tricrypto, do you still earn the crv on curve?


[05/01/2022 11:19 AM] j.#6352
no


[05/01/2022 11:19 AM] j.#6352
technically yes but you dont actually receive the CRV


[05/01/2022 11:20 AM] Bob_Sm0ke#1685
so if the vault is 7 percent apy, does that mean it is worse than the 9 percent in curve you would receive otherwise?


[05/01/2022 11:21 AM] j.#6352
sure but you'll have to do all the claiming and dumping and boosting yourself

I was new to Yearn.finance protocol by then, I sent USDC from my metamask to Yearn.finance contract address and I later check the etherscan and was confirm and successfully sent. Pls if you're in a position to help in Yearn.finance pls asist me.

This is not possible. Sorry. Also, the only USDC transfers that i see in the YFI token contract are from over a year ago. for 2 USDC. I doubt that this is the transfer that you're asking about.


[05/03/2022 10:20 AM] ONI#6888

[05/03/2022 10:45 AM] j.#6352
Yes. I see that. As mentioned above, your four interactions with USDC does not involve sending USDC to the YFI token contract.


[05/03/2022 10:46 AM] j.#6352
your four USDC transactions are a swap from ETH to USDC, a transfer to 0x0bc529c00C6401aEF6D220BE8C6Ea1667F6Ad93e, a swap from BNB to USDC, and adding liquidity to Pancake

[05/06/2022 7:07 PM] Crypt0x#6969
whatever you do, the graph is labelled share price


[05/06/2022 7:07 PM] Crypt0x#6969
share price is a unit of account one uses for tracking growth of the vaults right


[05/06/2022 7:25 PM] ONI#6888
Yes


[05/06/2022 7:26 PM] ONI#6888
You can use share price to see realized after-fee gains. such as yvboost here under Harvest. https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdffd/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-vaults=yvBOOST+0.3.5&from=now-30d&to=now This shows 6.4% yield gained over 30d

Hello, I'm trying to withdraw funds from the ETH vault, I sign the message through metamask and ledger live and then press withdraw, I get this error message. After investigating it chrome api.zapper.fi returns the following response: {"statusCode":500,"error":"Internal Server Error","message":"Returned error: execution reverted"}. Is this a known issue? How to get around this?

Hi,
I want to withdraw WBTC from the Yearn Fantom vault where I previously deposited it, however, when I click withdraw and confirm on my metamask wallet and ledger, I keep getting the message "unknown error occurred".
I have enough FTM as gas, so I don't know what the problem is.
Any suggestions?
Is there any admin I can contact?


[05/11/2022 3:26 PM] Crolev#3404
Have you set gas to be sufficiently high? The network seems to be congested atm: https://ftmscan.com/gastracker

[05/11/2022 3:26 PM] Crolev#3404
also try using a different RPC - you can change it ij metamask settings for fantom network


[05/11/2022 3:27 PM] Crolev#3404
probably the default RPC got spammed to death


[05/11/2022 3:32 PM] Sculler#5359

I only have 1 FTM, do you think that is too little for gas?
Also where can I get info of alternative RPC's?

No, you probably have plenty to use 2000-3000 gwei

the gas right now is at 27000 gwei so it could be the source of the problem

Hello! I have some USDC in a fantom yearn vault for a while now so obviously had earnt a bit from it, but for a few weeks now, it doesnt display my earned balance... there's just a dash instead of the number. Is this just a UI issue? Is my earned USDC still there?


[05/12/2022 3:48 AM] Cryptotoine#5099
actually... i think it's gone... because when I try to withdraw and press 'max', just the initial amount comes up


[05/12/2022 3:54 AM] Crolev#3404
Gas is over 300 rn so you need quite a lot of eth to pay for the transaction. Are you sure you have enough?
Also try withdrawing as the curve pool tokens and then withdraw them from curve.


[05/12/2022 5:45 AM] joblot#9587
thanks


[05/12/2022 5:51 AM] Crolev#3404
For how long were you using the vault? Harvests might happen as rare as once a week.
The amount displayed is your current balance which is higher than initial if you waited for long enough for a harvest to happen. Unfortunately amount earned cannot be displayed on Fantom at the moment, but it’s just an UI problem - the amount earned is still there.


[05/12/2022 5:52 AM] Crolev#3404
You can check your initial deposit by summing up your transactions on ftmscan. The difference between that and your current balance is your profit.


[05/12/2022 6:03 AM] Cryptotoine#5099
thank you! I expected the amount in balance to stay the same, while the amount in earned would build up week-over-week, so thats probably why i got confused

Hey team. My friend is having some issues and I'm trying to help him pull out of the vaults. He was in the Curve LINK vault for a while. I believe the vault got upgraded at some point and he migrated over to it.. but a little while back he tried using Zapper to exit the vault and received an error there. He was going back and forth with the Zapper support team for a while - and just got the run around. 

I was just trying to help him withdraw everything from Yearn, with the intention of moving over to Curve to swap the tokens back into LINK, but Yearn is also throwing an error. 

He has just over 900 YVCurve-LINK tokens in his wallet and is seeing this error anytime he tries to withdraw:

Do you have enough eth to pay for the gas?


[05/12/2022 2:36 PM] DOZΞ#4287
Yes I believe so. It doesn't even bring up the metamask prompt though


[05/12/2022 2:43 PM] Crolev#3404
It doesn't bring up the metamask window because it fails the simulation of the transaction for some reason. Usually that's because of insufficient eth in the wallet.
Right now gas is quite expensive - do you have at least 0.1-0.2 eth  in your wallet?


[05/12/2022 2:59 PM] arasakik#3764
so if i withdraw the crvSTETH directly i can convert it to ETH on curve?


[05/12/2022 3:04 PM] Crolev#3404
Yes, you can then withdraw directly from the pool. Keep in mind though that the pool is imbalanced atm and you might experience high slippage due to this.


[05/12/2022 3:18 PM] DOZΞ#4287
I will ask him to make sure there's sufficient ETH in there first and try again.

Hi guys, was wondering if I could get some assistance. I have used yearn in the past quite a bit, but pretty sure I don't have any assets on it rn. When I go to the site it states that I have holding (76k) but I cannot seem to find it, unless it is a bug?


[05/13/2022 10:44 AM] FoxTheSin#9247
holdings would be which vaults you are deposited in, again converted to usd.


[05/13/2022 10:46 AM] FoxTheSin#9247
Potentially a bug. You should check each chain (arbi, fantom, and ethereum) and look in the vaults, see if any holdings come up.


[05/13/2022 11:01 AM] sdsr#8724
How can I double check that? I don't think I have anything deposited in Yearn at the time  but it shows my holdings are 17k but when I click on it it doesn't show anything


[05/13/2022 11:08 AM] j.#6352
you can check your address on etherscan, or ftmscan if fantom, if it has any yv- tokens


[05/13/2022 11:08 AM] j.#6352
another user reported a similar issue a few weeks back. it was confirmed that no yv- tokens were in the address so it was a UI issue


[05/13/2022 11:09 AM] j.#6352
always check etherscan or ftmscan for your actual token amounts

[05/13/2022 11:10 AM] FoxTheSin#9247
someone else appears to have the same issue. This may be a subgraph issue, because zapper.fi isn't showing my yearn holdings currently.

To see your holdings, go into the "vaults" tab, check your "deposits" card. If you don't have anything there, check zapper.fi, if you still don't have anything there, check your wallet to confirm no tokens have yvXXX before the token name.

if you still want to be further sure, you can go through the vaults and add the token from each vault to confirm you don't have any hiding in your wallet.

the last harvest was 31 days ago. with the 30 day average for apy, this falls outside of that window so you see 0%. more frequent harvests were done just before that so there was a non-zero number at the time

Hey everyone, about 500 days ago I bought a bunch of yyUSD from Yearn.
It's been sitting there and want to swap it into YFI.
The token contract I own is https://etherscan.io/address/0x5dbcF33D8c2E976c6b560249878e6F1491Bca25c, any way to do that besides going through uniswap? I recall that these tokens could be redeemed in YFI or by some other mechanism. Thanks.

Hi there, I just "deposit" stETH  to vault curve 117 stETH-WETH

- Why is that in Curve "My Dash board" it shows I have no active pool?
- Why does it show I am earning a negative number? Is that because I just started?
- If the Vault APY showing varied from time to time?


[05/15/2022 11:57 PM] j.#6352
Curve cant see your Yearn deposits


[05/15/2022 11:57 PM] j.#6352
yes rates and yield vary constantly


[05/16/2022 12:01 AM] WiniC#9225
Thanks, and Why does it show I am earning a negative number? Is that because I just started?


[05/16/2022 12:02 AM] j.#6352
im not sure. id assume just a temporary UI issue.


[05/16/2022 12:02 AM] WiniC#9225
But I am indeed in the curve pool correct? Cause I am hoping to be in that curve pool to get the LDO reward


[05/16/2022 12:04 AM] j.#6352
Yes. You will not receive any LDO. The vault reinvests this in the pool.


[05/16/2022 12:08 AM] WiniC#9225
May I know what I am earning via Yearn with the 9.62% APY? in Curve stETH-WETH?


[05/16/2022 12:09 AM] j.#6352
You are earning LP tokens of the Curve stETH-ETH pool

https://news.bitcoin.com/lido-deploys-additional-curve-pool-to-improve-liquidity-around-bonded-eth-peg/
I meant this one, if I am indeed in the Curve pool, I supposed to be entitled to this LDO reward no?

[05/16/2022 12:10 AM] j.#6352
the vault's base/want/native token is the LP token for Curve's stETH-ETH pool. Yearn vaults earn whatever the vault name is. The vault names are the token names


[05/16/2022 12:10 AM] j.#6352
No


[05/16/2022 12:10 AM] j.#6352
You do not receive tokens other than the base token of the vault


[05/16/2022 12:10 AM] j.#6352
It's in the vault name


[05/16/2022 12:10 AM] j.#6352
DAI vault earns DAI, ETH vault earns ETH, Curve stETH-ETH vault earns Curve stETH-ETH, etc


[05/16/2022 12:11 AM] ONI#6888
You earn yield yes, but it gets compounded into the deposit token for you automatically


[05/16/2022 12:12 AM] WiniC#9225

[05/16/2022 12:12 AM] ONI#6888
So if the vault gets lido it sells it for more of the deposit token. Thus when you withdrawal your yield is in the form of more tokens upon withdrawal.


[05/16/2022 12:12 AM] ONI#6888
Generally for vaults best to wait 2 weeks to a month to judge your yield gained as harvests can take up to that long depending on the vault

Try zapping into the vault through zapper.fi and if thay doesn't work either then deposit into that pool on curve.fi to get pool tokens and then deposit them into this vault.

try connecting your wallet to Zapper.fi to check if the Pool page detects your liquidity

if yes, you should be able to withdraw from there

zapper does not, debank shows the staked LP but no info on specifically what pool it is, zerion shows "trade" where i withdrew from gauge but no LP balance shown

just go here login with your wallet https://zapper.fi/invest and it should show your curve pool tokens. Then you should be able to withdrawal them


[05/18/2022 1:02 PM] Buritona#1580
When I go to connect my wallet on zapper.fi i click on which wallet it is and nothing happens..

I tried to deposit a crypto to yearn and it took my eth for fees, twice... but then didn't deposit the crypto. Its not much, like $14 worth of eth but still. I'm a little upset over it. Anyone able to help out with that?


[05/18/2022 3:13 PM] old_frog_#6669
What vault did you try to deposit into?


[05/18/2022 3:22 PM] OButWhyTho6969#1917
It wasn't a particular vault I was just sorta messing around with some usd coin that was stuck in my coinbase wallet from early days. It costs more than it's worth right now to move it back to the exchange and liquidate it but it was only like a 9 dollar fee to deposit it into yearn with a 1%


[05/18/2022 3:22 PM] OButWhyTho6969#1917
Maybe its updating slow? Idk it's my first foray into this world to begin with lol


[05/18/2022 3:29 PM] old_frog_#6669
:PES_Think:  well i'm not sure what you would have done, it is possible if you clicked to deposit into one vault and then into another you approved 2 different contracts


[05/18/2022 3:38 PM] OButWhyTho6969#1917
I don't believe so. It was loading and then it acted like it failed so I approved it again


[05/18/2022 3:39 PM] OButWhyTho6969#1917
It was just a basic deposit from the initial first screen if that helps

I´m currently holding a position at Yearn Curve cvxCRV since April 30. This vault publishes a 24,03% APY. I have received 0.5 cents so far as rewards. Is this normal? Somebody can explain me how the rewards are distributed over time with this type of vault?


[05/18/2022 10:42 PM] ONI#6888
the last harvest was April 1st as seen here https://yearn.vision/d/ibsIoEknkdffd/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-vaults=yvCurve-cvxCRV+0.4.3&from=now-90d&to=now best to wait till there is a harvest on this vault


[05/18/2022 10:43 PM] ONI#6888
Since it has low tvl, the vault waits longer due to gas costs


[05/18/2022 11:00 PM] arberx#3367
Vaults with low yield and tvl should automatically have funds moved out the strats

Did you connect with your wallet to the website? You can do it by clicking a button in top right corner.


[05/19/2022 7:20 AM] Crolev#3404
Also on which network did you make a deposit on? Ethereum or Fantom? Did you select the correct network to make a withdraw on?


[05/19/2022 7:48 AM] j.#6352
If you're Monis on Telegram, this should be resolved. Otherwise, go to the Settings page on yearn.finance then click the toggle for signing transactions then try again.

Hello,
There's an UI error on Fantom that causes Earned amounts not to display properly.
Until it gets fixed to calculate your earnings add all your deposits based on ftmscan transactions and calculate a difference between that sum and the current balance amount displayed in yearn.finance UI.


[05/19/2022 10:25 AM] Crolev#3404
It's just a display error - the value is still compounded on the vault.

Actually - correction:
This vault is not allocated at the moment which you can check here:
https://yearn.watch/vault/0x0fBbf9848D969776a5Eb842EdAfAf29ef4467698

There is only one strategy that is being constantly exited over time:
StrategyHECStakerBoo
Stakes yvBOO in SpookySwap to receive xBOO which is staked to earn HEC. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more yvBOO which is deposited back into the strategy.

Could be a zapper issue. Try swapping to reth or wsteth first, then deposit into curve, then deposit the curve lp tokens into the yearn vault

Not sure what you mean by rebase, but yeah as stated above it includes the curve LP staking reward (trading fees+CRV emissions+LIDO emissions) + compounding reward?


[05/22/2022 8:19 PM] warmorangejuice#1602
What I mean by rebase is the roughly 4% APR for staking eth through Lido

Hi team, was this the protocol that was exploited early 2021? Were these funds ever recovered? I’m investigating other flash loan exploits and have found some traces to yearn


[05/23/2022 12:27 PM] Crolev#3404
Yes, there was an old DAI vault that got hacked in early 2021. The funds were never recovered, but the vault token holders were compensated from Yearn treasury.


[05/23/2022 12:27 PM] Crolev#3404
What do you mean exactly by traces to yearn?


[05/23/2022 5:23 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Actually, I believe that we did recovered part of the funds. The hacker sold tokens for USDT that were freeze by tether, later they minted them and send the funds back to the multisig


[05/23/2022 5:27 PM] Crolev#3404
Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks for the added info.


[05/23/2022 8:08 PM] tg#7653
It seems like that same person that carried out (at least) 2 other hacks was also responsible for your exploit. Have found evidence linking them together

Do you have any additional info/analysis that was done at the time that I might be able to look through?

[05/24/2022 6:04 AM] Crolev#3404
There's a backend issue on Fantom that prevents the Earned amount from displaying the profits.
In the meanwhile until it gets fixed summarize all the deposits you've made to the vault using ftmscan and deduct that from the Current Balance you see on yearn.finance page. The difference is your profit on the vault.

It is variable yes afaik. Best to ask on their discord. Iron bank and Yearn are separate projects now

Hi there, I'm new here and had a question on this quote from the Yearn docs (https://docs.yearn.finance/getting-started/guides/how-boost-works): 

"Yearn achieves this because it periodically donates 10% of the farmed CRV it earns through all Curve.fi based strategies to this yveCRV vault and allows yveCRV vault depositors to claim Yearn’s share of Curve protocol fees. This means we give all of Yearn’s rewards, which we could have claimed for the protocol, to yveCRV depositors, boosting their weekly rewards."

Is this 10% on the trading fees accrued to the veCRV tokens? As in, say Yearn's veCRV tokens accrue $100 in trading fees. $10 of those trading fees will automatically get relocked into Curve for more veCRV? Or, are there two 10% cuts: one taking a cut of trading fees and one taking a cut of Yearn's individual protocol revenues?  Please let me know if that's a confusing question


[05/27/2022 4:31 PM] ONI#6888
any vault that farms crv, 10% of that crv is locked as veCRV into our yveCRV vault


[05/27/2022 4:33 PM] ONI#6888
its not about fees, its taken from All farmed CRV on curve based vaults. IE all crv based vaults only sell 90% of farmed crv and they lock 10% of it up.


[05/27/2022 5:50 PM] hamb#0609
Ahh, very helpful! I'm also trying to understand what the difference is between the share of trading fees and the share of Yearn's claim of Curve's protocol fees. If I deposit CRV, I am entitled to the trading fees on Curve because the CRV is locked for veCRV. Is this saying in addition to that, I'm entitled to a share of fees from  ALL veCRV Yearn owns? If so, is my share simply a pro rata share of the entire Yearn CRV liquidity? 

"Earn a share of trading fees from the Curve.fi protocol (3Crv), automatically reinvested (for the yvBOOST vault).
Earn a share of Yearn’s claim of Curve.fi protocol fees, on top of your own rewards (more 3CRV!), automatically reinvested (for the yvBOOST vault)."


[05/27/2022 8:56 PM] Adref#5620
On the yearn web app interface, it shows "Deposits" as zero, even if "Value" is non-zero; is this a known issue?


[05/27/2022 8:57 PM] ONI#6888
in vaults under avaliable to deposit?


[05/27/2022 9:13 PM] Adref#5620
In Vaults, under "Balance"\


[05/27/2022 9:14 PM] Crolev#3404
Did you connect your wallet to yearn website and made sure the correct network is selected in both Metamask and yearn UI?


[05/27/2022 9:15 PM] Adref#5620
Ok, so I refreshed and now it shows as expected; strange

hi legends, im trying to withdraw from v1 yYFI vault but can't seem to get tx through

anything u recommend I do pls ?


[05/29/2022 10:25 PM] kx9x#3778
can always try v2.yearn.finance


[05/29/2022 10:25 PM] kx9x#3778
and make sure you withdraw it as YFI


[05/29/2022 10:26 PM] DiscoStu#2016
ok


[05/29/2022 10:26 PM] DiscoStu#2016
thx


[05/29/2022 10:30 PM] DiscoStu#2016
can only see it on v1 though, it's super old vault i think


[05/29/2022 10:34 PM] kx9x#3778
ah then maybe try the v1.yearn.finance UI. if that doesn't work, then use etherscan


[05/31/2022 9:44 AM] yMoon#7434

I heard we were developing vaults to take advantage of opportunities here was that shelved or still being considered?


[05/31/2022 12:03 PM] FoxTheSin#9247
Most likely still being considered, a good place to ask would be #🧠strategies , and potentially you could even figure the strategy out and propose it!

hi there, does Yearn earn any fees from Iron Bank activity? If so, what's the fee structure?


[05/31/2022 6:04 PM] ONI#6888
No we do not


[05/31/2022 6:05 PM] hamb#0609
I see, so is Iron Bank its own separate entity? Could governance ever theoretically vote to take fees from Iron Bank?


[05/31/2022 6:08 PM] arberx#3367
Yes it is

if I want to withdraw (ETH) from the crvSTETH vault but I'm getting 
```
HTTP to https://api.zapper.fi/v2/zap-out/vault/yearn/transaction?affiliateAddress=[snip] request failed (status 500)

how do I work around that? Should I just wait for the zapper api to stop shitting the bed(?)

nvm, figured it out. for fellow brainlets using search in the future: 
1. withdraw as crvSTETH (Curve LP Tokens)
2. go here:
https://curve.fi/steth/withdraw
3. use the crv UI to complete the withdrawal.

key words to help future searchers: crv eth steth 500 zapper.fi

Hi there, anyone know if there is an API for vault v2 contract metadata similar to the one for v1 contracts (https://docs.yearn.finance/vaults/yearn-api)? In particular I need the APY data.


[06/06/2022 12:47 PM] Crolev#3404
v1 refers to the API version, not vault versions - use the API endpoint linked in the doc.

It's working on my end on Brave so I need more details to report the problem to the web team.

Hi. I hope this is the appropriate platform. When I click the "Withdraw" button in the Vaults the screen blurs and nothing else happens. I need to withdraw some of my USDC.

I can't guarantee that it's a solution because any theme works for me on two different browsers and three addresses


[06/09/2022 6:43 AM] j.#6352
Otherwise, depending on your wallet, try turning off the Enable Signed Approvals in the Settings tab

Hi. I'm connected with Ethereum. I've tried on Brave and Chrome. Same issue with both. The box does not appear.

question what wallet is it trying to go to when you request a withdraw it isn't my wallet address


[06/09/2022 9:44 PM] kx9x#3778
@Unknown What wallet are you using? Do you happen to mean the smart contract address?


[06/09/2022 9:45 PM] kx9x#3778
withdrawing means interacting with the vault smart contract so it is possible that it is showing this address


[06/09/2022 9:45 PM] kx9x#3778
you can copy paste here and I can confirm

its not an option 😦


[06/12/2022 3:39 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Just saw about questions were about the same topic, it's an error on the website. You can wait for it to be solved or withdraw by interacting directly with the smart contract

Looking for help to withdraw steth from yearn. Having the same issues. When


[06/13/2022 12:48 AM] delias.eth#3674
Is this for the curve steth vault? Won’t withdraw my eth w this contract


[06/13/2022 12:52 AM] Crolev#3404
try to withdraw as Curve pool tokens


[06/13/2022 12:52 AM] Crolev#3404
then you can withdraw them on curve.fi


[06/13/2022 12:52 AM] Crolev#3404
keep in mind that steth-eth pool is imbalanced at the moment so you will experience slippage if you choose to withdraw it as weth


[06/13/2022 1:07 AM] j.#6352
The link i posted is for the WETH vault. Follow Crolev's suggestion above


[06/13/2022 1:08 AM] delias.eth#3674
Thx. So withdraw to stETH and then use curve to withdraw to weth or eth?


[06/13/2022 1:09 AM] delias.eth#3674
What is y’all’s strategy in this. Hodl or get out?


[06/13/2022 1:09 AM] j.#6352
withdraw to Curve stETH the LP token yes

[06/13/2022 1:09 AM] j.#6352
then withdraw eth/weth on Curve


[06/13/2022 1:11 AM] delias.eth#3674
stETH to wETH on curve or eth to weth after. I’ve had this over a year and now the imbalance is bad and all w Celsius I’m thinking to be risk off


[06/13/2022 1:22 AM] delias.eth#3674

[06/13/2022 1:40 AM] kx9x#3778
The concentrated pool is weth and had better rates last I checked


[06/13/2022 1:40 AM] kx9x#3778
But maybe like 0.95 vs 0.9522 or something. Pretty close


[06/13/2022 1:49 AM] delias.eth#3674
Yeah little off last few minutes by like .01


[06/13/2022 2:25 AM] delias.eth#3674
Well I withdrew from the vault on yearn to steth and see it on curve but then it doesn’t show to withdraw it

Hi all - trying to withdraw some USDC from a vault and keep on getting the error `Error populating transaction. Make sure you have enough funds for gas fees.` 

However I do have funds in my account - any ideas?


[06/13/2022 12:59 PM] Jimbobbins#2707
I am trying to do it from a gnosis safe - does the safe require ETH even though the signers are different?


[06/13/2022 1:12 PM] Jimbobbins#2707
that did infact solve the problem - once I deposited a small amount of ETH in the safe the UI let we withdraw USDC from the vault


[06/13/2022 1:17 PM] Crolev#3404
Thank you for reporting this to us, this is clearly an error that should be fixed. I'll let the web team know.

Hello all, I hope that everyone is well! JP here from Arable Protocol team, we have an MVP launch this month - June 28th and have built the first synthetic yield farming protocol that supports synthetic farming and swapping of different assets of various chains under one roof. We are looking to enable YFI as collateral token to mint our over-collateralized stablecoin called the arUSD and integrate an existing YFI farm into a synthetic yield farm as part of partnership, as well as co-marketing of the product and liquidity partnership for arUSD/YFI. Can a @Community Mod please @ me here so that I can know who to DM regarding partnerships? Thank you!

Hi. what happend to the crvIBEUR pool om YFI? I had a chunk of money there but now i cany seem to swap them back to anything.


[06/14/2022 9:57 AM] Crolev#3404
You need to withdraw from the vault first on yearn.finance
You can withdraw as Curve pool tokens and then redeem them on curve.fi or you can zap into any token on the list, but beware the slippage.

I have like 160$ of eth - 0.146 ... ok, it could be not enough for the swap transaction, but even for the native withdraw ???


[06/15/2022 9:01 AM] Walt#3537
It’s a enough for gas


[06/15/2022 9:01 AM] Neron The Wolf#4887
so the problem is elsewhere


[06/15/2022 9:01 AM] Walt#3537
Right


[06/15/2022 9:02 AM] Neron The Wolf#4887
and gas should be calculated in metamask... I do not receive a transaction to sign


[06/15/2022 9:03 AM] Walt#3537
Maybe you have an error 525, MM not able to connect to yearn


[06/15/2022 9:25 AM] Crolev#3404
Which vault is that? Link or Curve Link vault? If it's the first one then try to withdraw LINK tokens, if the latter then try to withdraw Curve Pool tokens and then withdraw them from curve.fi


[06/15/2022 9:25 AM] Crolev#3404
try asking in #💻dev-open-chat


[06/15/2022 9:26 AM] Crolev#3404
Try to withdraw as curve pool tokens (the same token you see in vault - crvPBTC) and then go to curve.fi to withdraw those pool tokens.


[06/15/2022 9:29 AM] Neron The Wolf#4887
That is giving the gas error... @Walt gave me some suggestions - ctrl f5, restart, connect rectify from surge etc ... I will try them later today and report back if the issue persists


[06/15/2022 9:30 AM] Crolev#3404
I strongly suggest against doing whatever was suggested to you by a random person privately in DM


[06/15/2022 9:31 AM] Crolev#3404
if you get a gas error then that means you don't have enough gas on the address to pay for the transaction


[06/15/2022 9:34 AM] Neron The Wolf#4887
so you're checking this even before sending the transaction for signature to metamask?
ok... I'll get some more and will try again


[06/15/2022 9:42 AM] j.#6352
For safety of other people in the server, caan you post a screenshot of what that person sent? might be spam/scam. we'll ban in case it is

I'm looking for 20% APY in the fantom fUSDT vault but not seeing any growth. Just looking for any info on why and what it means to be "allocated" or not, as per https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/734811808401063966/976969887392084028


[06/16/2022 5:43 PM] Crolev#3404
Take a look at discussion here:
https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/734862139386232902/986199605278539886

The short answer is that the 20% yield is past performance based on just last 7 days and it will be different than future performance.


[06/16/2022 5:45 PM] djb#1919
ok, but in 3 days, my balance hasn't increased at all, does that indicate something is wrong?


[06/16/2022 5:47 PM] Crolev#3404

Oh, that means that there is no efficient zap path


[06/17/2022 9:22 PM] Crolev#3404
what zapping does is that it swaps the source token into whatever is needed to deposit into vault


[06/17/2022 9:23 PM] Crolev#3404
that vault is a curve pool so it would trade your tokens for relevant tokens, deposit them into curve pool and then deposit the pool tokens into the vault


[06/17/2022 9:23 PM] Crolev#3404
if you can't use zapper then unfortunately you have to trade those tokens for what you need first

Try to withdraw as curve mim pool tokens and then withdraw them on curve.fi
There is pretty much only mim in that pool now so you will find it hard to swap to something else.

How long ago did you make the deposit? Maybe it was one of the old, deprecated vaults. 
Check also https://v2.yearn.finance/ and https://v1.yearn.finance/ - those are the old UIs and you can try to withdraw from the old vaults there.

@rj888 what token were you trying to withdrawal from the link vault?


[06/20/2022 6:13 PM] rj888#9370
LINK


[06/20/2022 6:18 PM] ONI#6888
Seems to be working fine from what I can tell. Can you hard refresh the website with cntrl + shift + r and try again?


[06/20/2022 6:18 PM] ONI#6888
if that still doesnt work you can withdrawal via the contract https://etherscan.io/address/0x671a912C10bba0CFA74Cfc2d6Fba9BA1ed9530B2#writeContract connect your wallet and hit write on #26. If you would like to withdrawal all


[06/20/2022 7:08 PM] Crolev#3404
Right now most of that yield comes from pool fees on curve: https://llama.airforce/#/curve/gauges/tricrypto2
But it won't last for long as those fees are the result of heightened price volatility over the last couple of days.

I tried the hard refresh and another transaction failed. I don't know how to do what you recommended in you alternative solution. Additionally, others in the general chat told me there's no LINK to withdraw on and thats why my transactions are failing. Do you have any thoughts on this?


[06/20/2022 11:52 PM] ONI#6888
Can you dm me the transaction you sent which failed?


[06/21/2022 12:14 AM] ONI#6888
It says out of gas, what wallet are you using?


[06/21/2022 12:15 AM] rj888#9370
Metamask


[06/21/2022 12:15 AM] ONI#6888
Withdrawals are working fine. It says out of gas so seems your wallets gas pricing might be off for some reason.


[06/21/2022 12:15 AM] ONI#6888
Is it up to date?


[06/21/2022 12:19 AM] rj888#9370

Wait for what?


[06/21/2022 12:23 AM] ONI#6888
Wait to try to withdraw from the website ui. Sorry for the poor wording.


[06/21/2022 12:26 AM] rj888#9370
How will I know when it's a good time to try again? (Not trying to be rude, I just don't want to burn anymore hard-earned cash on failed transactions)


[06/21/2022 12:27 AM] ONI#6888
@rj888 you can try here


[06/21/2022 12:28 AM] ONI#6888
Click that link its the link vault. Connect your wallet. And go to write method #26 click withdrawal.


[06/21/2022 12:29 AM] ONI#6888
This will withdrawal all from the link vault for you

Last question, how do I know this isn't a scam address and that the funds will go to my address without having to do an expensive dummy transaction?


[06/21/2022 12:31 AM] ONI#6888
If you click on the vault address, you will see it points to the same contract as the vault tokens you have in your wallet.

the withdrawal function is just `withdrawal` (all) so there is no input for you to add anything else, like an address or amount. You just click it, it withdrawals only to your address the full amount you have in the vault.

Please help me. I wanted to withdraw my Curve USDN Token from the Curve USDN pool. That did not work for ETH, since there is obviously a problem with the 1% Slippage on zapper.fi. So I did the withdraw with just the Curve USDN token, which I now have in my metamask.  I tried to zap to ETH on Zapper, but they dont offer that token to zap. I tried Uniswap, but it failed because there is no liquidity. So.... how can I swap my Curve USDN Token back again to ETH or USDC or....  I tried to deposit that token in a vault with a token, that zapper offers, but with that Curve USDN token I obvioulsy can only invest in the same vault. And there is the withdraw-1%-slippage-problem that I mentioned above. Does anybody has an idea how to get my ETH back?

[06/28/2022 8:54 AM] Crolev#3404
Do you have enough eth to pay for gas?
If yes then try also to withdraw as tokens native to the vault - i.e. WETH, curve pool tokens, etc


[06/28/2022 8:58 AM] tdot#8106
Yeah I have about 1ETH in that wallet, I'm trying to zap out of 3Crypto. If I exit in native tokens, how would you recommend I swap it to ETH?

Okay the vault is 0xacd43e627e64355f1861cec6d3a6688b31a6f952 which is definitely the v1 vault.

Since for some reason the old UI seems to not be working here then try just using etherscan directly:

no, this method is to withdraw only a select number of tokens
use the one just below this one, it's named "14. withdrawAll" and you don't need to provide any arguments for it

Try using the number 13 option and put in as argument the number of vault tokens you hold formatted as integer (so the number you see in etherscan times 10^18)

I am looking for a link that describes the Lock function and how it differs from Deposit in Yearn.  For examples in Labs, Opportunities I see an opportunity to "Lock" yveCRV.  Below I see the opportunity to "Deposit" pSLPyvBOOST-ETH. What is the difference between Lock and Deposit.


[07/03/2022 11:20 PM] Crolev#3404
You can never withdraw CRV from yveCRV because it gets locked up in veCRV


[07/03/2022 11:20 PM] Crolev#3404
If you are asking about that then you probably want to buy yvBOOST directly on sushi btw


[07/03/2022 11:20 PM] Crolev#3404
Also everyone who DMs you first is a scammer


[07/04/2022 12:53 AM] Wayland#7122
Thanks for the reminder that DM are scammers! 

I did purchase yvBoost on Sushi Swap last week. Does depositing it into pSLPyvBOOST-ETH eliminate the approx 124% that I am making in Labs or does it add approx 5.69% to what I am already earning on the yvBoost in Labs?


[07/04/2022 12:57 AM] Crolev#3404
It doesn't, but then you hold 50:50 eth and yvboost in the sushi pool. This means that you might experience divergence loss (impermanent loss) and that specific vault is not even a vault, but a pickle jar so you'd still have to go to the pickle protocol website to claim your earned pickle


[07/04/2022 12:58 AM] Crolev#3404
That 50% of the position still earns the yvboost yield though - via share price growth

the share price grows over time which means that the ratio of yveCRV tokens to one yvBOOST token goes up every harvest

Now I did retry with a bigger gas limit? Any Idea what I should do? Last time I had this, I used the legacy dapp and it worked. But I don't think the old app is still somewhere?


[07/07/2022 11:22 AM] Crolev#3404
The old UI is on https://v2.yearn.finance/
Did you try to use etherscan directly? If yes then you should have used the function number 26. - it's withdraws everything and doesn't have any input parameters that might be difficult to understand how to fill out.


[07/07/2022 11:22 AM] Crolev#3404

[07/09/2022 7:44 PM] AtlantaFalcons75#7696

[07/09/2022 7:55 PM] Crolev#3404
@AtlantaFalcons75 if you got a DM then it's probably from a scanner


[07/09/2022 7:55 PM] Crolev#3404
that was a scammer trying to steal your seed phrase by 'resetting your wallet'


[07/09/2022 7:55 PM] Crolev#3404
sorry for late reply - you should check firstly if you have enough eth to pay for the transaction


[07/09/2022 7:56 PM] Crolev#3404
and secondly if that doesn't work then unfortunately you might have to deposit to the curve pool manually and then deposit the curve pool tokens into that vault


[07/09/2022 7:56 PM] Crolev#3404
you can also try zapping on zapper.fi before that


[07/09/2022 7:56 PM] AtlantaFalcons75#7696
Ah thank you.  Yeah I am trying to zap ETH directly and keeping plenty in reserve.


[07/09/2022 7:57 PM] AtlantaFalcons75#7696
I looked at zapper.fi but I am not sure which "invest" is the yearn vault


[07/09/2022 8:00 PM] Crolev#3404
I don't see it either, but you can also zap into the Curve pool there (though at that point you might as well use curve.fi directly anyways)


[07/09/2022 8:00 PM] AtlantaFalcons75#7696
Yeah that is what I was also think.  Just doing the whole chain and trying to depost steCRV.

DeBank showing that I have 105 USDT in the Yearn Finance vault but on checking the Yearn platform (vault) nothing of such was found or withdrawable.

The fund was deposited 40 days ago according to some data. Bekow is the Contract address that store the fund as traced on Etherscan

Kindly help me locating the fund and how to revome it

[07/11/2022 6:11 PM] Crolev#3404
Don't tag admin please.
I see that this is some kind of Maker proxy contract. Unfortunately I am not very familiar with it so you should probably go ask about it in the Maker Discord (ask how to retrieve tokens from contract address). It is very likely though that it is impossible and those vault tokens can never again be moved from there.


[07/11/2022 6:25 PM] CaptainTee#0998
Apology for tagging the admins 🙏
I didn't know the exact Maker (Project) that owns the Contract, all the search I made are just directing me to Yearn Vault

Can you please help me get someone from the devs to help me find the right maker (project) to consult ❓


[07/11/2022 6:30 PM] Crolev#3404
The token on that address if that of the yearn vault, but that address is a Maker proxy contract. To find their Discord just search for Maker on CoinGecko and click on the link that should be attached there.


[07/11/2022 6:33 PM] CaptainTee#0998

[07/14/2022 9:20 PM] j.#6352
Metamask is not reliable in detecting and showing you all of the tokens in your address unless you manually add them. The Yearn website is able to see this because it looks at your address. I was also able to see it because i looked up your address on Etherscan.

Can you point to me how to add token/ the contract pls? Since when I went to curve.fi I can’t add nothing there from my metamask cause it wont show


[07/15/2022 1:03 AM] ONI#6888
which vault was it?


[07/15/2022 1:09 AM] j.#6352
Copy and paste this address when you add custom token in Metamask: 0x828b154032950C8ff7CF8085D841723Db2696056


[07/15/2022 1:10 AM] j.#6352
Withdraw from the Curve pool here: https://curve.fi/factory/117/withdraw


[07/15/2022 1:11 AM] j.#6352
I don't recommend relying on Metamask to see your token balances. Just look up your address on Etherscan. It's quicker that way


[07/15/2022 3:56 AM] sonax#6180
Hi all - had a question, I'm using the Curve stETH Pool yVault. When should I be expecting rewards to come in? It's been in there for a week and nothing seems to happen

[07/15/2022 4:01 AM] sonax#6180
it's really strange because the vault page says holdings 0.00 USD and then under deposits I see my Curve stETH deposit

when exactly did you deposit?

Thanks @j.  for pointing me the right direction, I will try to withdraw when the gas fee is more reasonable, may I know any vault in Yearn for stETH you would recommend? Cheers

Guys, I'm building a product and plan to integrate yearn vault as one of its components. I've read about partnership program. https://docs.yearn.finance/partners/introduction
Is it still a thing? If so, am I required to use AffiliateToken.sol, or is it allowed to create my own wrapper contract that inherits BaseWrapper? I'm focused on utilizing ERC4626 as much as possible, so would prefer to use my own implementation

[07/18/2022 3:45 PM] ONI#6888
Hey yes its still a thing, you can make your own custom wrapper so long as it follows the PR format and would allow us to track the vault tokens.

if you filled out the partnership form from the intro docs you linked then we will reach out to you soon

Is there a guide or video explaining how to use/understand yearn.watch?


[07/22/2022 6:05 PM] defiglenn#3350
don't think so. what bit are you struggling with?


[07/22/2022 6:10 PM] EyeCandy#9468
1) which wallet do I look at to track, using https://trackavault.com/, a vault or strategies performance?
2) Why do some vaults not have a health check? Are those riskier because of this?
3) Who chooses how frequent "reports" are provided. I see some vaults have many months between reports and then sometimes twice a week


[07/22/2022 6:12 PM] defiglenn#3350
I think the reports is because of how frequently there is a harvest. You can also see this on the #🌽mainnet-harvest channel


[07/22/2022 6:12 PM] defiglenn#3350
they should all have a healthcheck, if not i think it is being worked on and will be out soon. Wouldn't assume no healthcheck means its riskier-  just the work hasn't been shared yet


[07/22/2022 6:14 PM] defiglenn#3350
trackavault looks at your existing deposits on yearn. So on mine i've got some DAI deposited I can see. Do you see anything on yours?


[07/22/2022 6:16 PM] EyeCandy#9468
Thanks for clarifying. No since im just researching now before I test one out. I thought track vault could be used with wallets that are not my own since they have the import feature and i can type any address


[07/22/2022 6:41 PM] defiglenn#3350
oh I didn't notice, thats cool. yeah I guess feel free to try another address, I can share mine if u like

When I try to connect MetaMask wallet it sends me to the App Store even though I’m in MetaMask browser. How can I fix this? Cheers 🖖


[07/23/2022 11:14 AM] defiglenn#3350
that's weird. I'd recommend trying with a different browser like Chrome or Brave


[07/23/2022 5:37 PM] FlawlessResponse#5610
I'm having the same problem. Started a few days ago and is still an issue for me. I have metamask installed and have no issues using it on other dApps, but yearn doesnt acknowledge that i have metamask installed.


[07/23/2022 7:15 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Just hit “wallet connect” option and then “MetaMask”, and it connected just fine in my iPhone


[07/24/2022 2:43 AM] DerinJapan#8325
I’m on iPhone. Hit wallet connect and it asks me to choose wallet even though I’m already in MetaMask. When I click MetaMask it takes me to the App Store.


[07/24/2022 3:21 AM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Yes it doesn’t work in the MetaMask browser, try opening it on a safari tab


[07/24/2022 6:38 AM] Flying Shroom#0161
I experience the same issue discussed above in Firefox on a computer. Yearn Finance does not recognize that the MetaMask extension is installed even though it works normally with other dApps. Any help is appreciated.

It worked eventually in a different browser for me, so this seems to be a solution.


[07/26/2022 2:22 AM] Wayland#7122
I have the same issue, when using Yearn and selecting Metamask in Firefox sends me to the appstore to install metamask, which I already have installed in Firefox. As others have reported this started happening as of sever days ago.

[07/26/2022 2:04 PM] Marx7#0211
Can you explain what you mean by that? 

On my phone: I tried to select WalletConnect and at the next screen I selected Metamask, that took me to the app store.

On my desktop: I use Firefox and select WalletConnect and then get a QR code or a list that does not have Metamask in it. If I close that, there's a splash page that says 'Login and Authorize Your Wallet' with a spinning icon roughly where I think the 'OK' button would be

I need some help here: I have been using Yearn for a year, with a Ledger Nano S, and have successfully logged in at least once a month.  Today the Yearn web interface is failing to connect to my wallet. Specifically,  when I click the initial "connect" button on the initial screen (either "portfolio" or "vaults," and the "hardware wallet connect" pop-up appears, none of the three selection buttons responds when I click in it (ethereum, ethereum ledger live, or custom path). However, the "connect" button does still respond. Then on the next "select account" box, normally my active wallet address would automatically appear in the drop-down box.  Today no address appears. When I click on the empty drop-down box, it offers several addresses, none of which are mine. If I click "done," it defaults to the first address and shows $0 balances.


[07/27/2022 1:43 PM] Nerk#8983
I have already tried the following fixes:


[07/27/2022 1:43 PM] Nerk#8983
-Used Chrome, Brave, and Edge


[07/27/2022 1:43 PM] Nerk#8983
-Used a second computer


[07/27/2022 1:44 PM] Nerk#8983
-Updated my Ledger Live software and my Ledger firmware


[07/27/2022 1:44 PM] arberx#3367
is ur nano up to date?


[07/27/2022 1:44 PM] Nerk#8983
yes, did that today


[07/27/2022 1:44 PM] arberx#3367
are u connecting through ledger live or directly?


[07/27/2022 1:44 PM] Nerk#8983
directly


[07/27/2022 1:44 PM] arberx#3367
try ledger live/connect


[07/27/2022 1:45 PM] Nerk#8983
I didn't know that was an option - I assume you mean through the Ledger Live app?


[07/27/2022 1:45 PM] arberx#3367
Yes


[07/27/2022 1:45 PM] arberx#3367
No


[07/27/2022 1:46 PM] arberx#3367
Yes through ledger live


[07/27/2022 1:46 PM] arberx#3367
On ur device


[07/27/2022 1:47 PM] Nerk#8983
To be precise: if you mean I should, on the Yearn web page, select "ledger live" option on the initial "connect" screen, I can't do that, the button will not respond


[07/27/2022 1:47 PM] Nerk#8983
If you mean I should do something in the ledger live app -- what do I do? I don't see any "connect" option


[07/27/2022 1:48 PM] arberx#3367
do u have the ledger live app on ur desktop?


[07/27/2022 1:48 PM] Nerk#8983
yes


[07/27/2022 1:48 PM] arberx#3367
then u should be able to connect through it


[07/27/2022 1:48 PM] arberx#3367
Another thing u can try: connect ur ledger to metamask


[07/27/2022 1:49 PM] arberx#3367

Ledger live is legendary for being a piece of shit since day 0


[07/27/2022 5:51 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
Regarding the connection problems inside MetaMask mobile browser, this is the reason users can’t use yearn inside it: “looking into this one, Metamask app browser injects an inline script to sites, but we have security policies that block this from happening since its unsafe, as we dont want external (possibly malicious) code to be executed in the client side. Seems they have knowledge of this issue but have not yet solved it https://github.com/MetaMask/detect-provider/issues/31. Will comment on the issue and follow it so we know when its closed.

For now, the only alternative is tell users to connect from any other mobile browser, use Wallet Connect and select Metamask wallet so that it loads directly in the browser and not directly on metamask app.”

"For now, the only alternative is tell users to connect from any other mobile browser, use Wallet Connect and select Metamask wallet so that it loads directly in the browser and not directly on metamask app.”
I can't even get that far...When I select WalletConnect and then Metamask, it just hangs forever on the 'Logon and Authorize your Wallet' splash screen. I'll deleted my Yearn cookie and cleared my cache to try again. When I selected WalletConnect and then chose 'desktop' for the QR code screen to go away, I did not see an option for Metamask, Rainbow, or WalletConnect at that point.
These 2 screenshots are my options:

Call exit() if you still have YFI staked and pending rewards or just getReward() if you only have pending rewards

I'm having an issue connecting to the dApp at yearn.finance with metamask.

When I click connect and choose metamask, the modal doesn't see metamask and tells me to install it. But metamask is installed and shows as connected to the site.

firefox, windows. worked before (maybe a month ago?)

note that the PR comes with different build of the website that has the fix. So if instead of yearn.finance you log in https://pr-739.d27dgpz01hmbvx.amplifyapp.com/ then it should work (it does, just checked)

Hello, I have Metamask installed on Firefox, at each connection attempt it asks me to install Metamask?

Hello. Quick question on 2 of my fantom wallets, when I go to the vault showing higher balances than what I have in my wallet. Is this a known issue? Thanks


[07/31/2022 4:35 PM] Crolev#3404
it's normal - each vault token corresponds to larger number of underlying tokens


[07/31/2022 4:35 PM] Crolev#3404
that ratio is called the share price


[07/31/2022 4:38 PM] Crolev#3404
you can check it yourself by taking the number of vault tokens you hold and multiplying it by the share price you can find in read contract tab on ftmscan, i.e. for yvWFTM: https://ftmscan.com/address/0x0dec85e74a92c52b7f708c4b10207d9560cefaf0#readContract

[07/31/2022 4:38 PM] Crolev#3404
the number under 4. pricePerShare indicates your share price (need to divide it by 10^18 though)


[07/31/2022 4:56 PM] Vann#0890
Thank you for responding. I understand that I’ve been using yearn  for a while now but just noticed today in the vault section where it says “holdings” it’s showing a dollar value that I do not have in my wallet in WFTM, yvWFTM or any other token. So I was wondering if this was a no glitch if it’s not a glitch I hope I can find the holding value at showing into of my wallets.


[07/31/2022 4:57 PM] Crolev#3404
ah no, those are just your wallet holdings


[07/31/2022 4:57 PM] Crolev#3404
your deposits are under the label "deposits" if you have any


[07/31/2022 4:57 PM] Vann#0890
It’s not a lot of money but one wallet showing $400 in value and the other 300


[07/31/2022 4:57 PM] Vann#0890
I’ve been checking ftm scan and I haven’t Done any deposits in a long time


[07/31/2022 4:58 PM] Crolev#3404
it's normal that wallets differ - usually different wallets recognize different tokens


[07/31/2022 4:58 PM] Crolev#3404
some tokens don't get listed for some wallets


[07/31/2022 4:58 PM] Vann#0890
Exactly


[07/31/2022 4:58 PM] Vann#0890
Believe me I was hoping that I had some deposits I forgot about lol


[07/31/2022 4:59 PM] Vann#0890
Gonna do some more digging hopefully I can find the extra $700 between both wallets. Thanks again

[08/01/2022 1:06 PM] Crolev#3404
click on the vaults tab (on the left) and select the vault you are interested in
be warned though that at this level of funds it's not worth it to even make a transaction - on ethereum the gas cost will be higher than this value and on fantom it will take forever to earn a worthwhile yield

[08/02/2022 5:54 PM] old_frog_#6669
Risks vary by vault forsure, you have to assess what your goal is, how long you want to hold, what token are you holding inside the vault.

Hey guys, im trying to weigh the risks of the Curve CVX-ETH vault. Besides the normal risks of contract writing and hackers what is the worst case scenario for this vault? cvxCRV to CRV exchange goes to shit?


[08/05/2022 1:42 PM] ONI#6888
so this vault its cvx pair with eth so besides sc risk, you could have IL from the changing price of cvx vs eth

{Reactions}
👍 

[08/05/2022 1:43 PM] ONI#6888
This is a curve v2 pool as opposed to the stable-pools curve v1


[08/05/2022 1:44 PM] ONI#6888
so you have to deal with IL in curve v2 pools way more so than you would with a v1 pool on curve


[08/05/2022 1:45 PM] ONI#6888
but if you do want to use this curve pool, our vaults will automatically compound the rewards for you


[08/05/2022 2:01 PM] EyeCandy#9468
Hmm using impermanent loss calculators there would need to be a serious divergence of coin price to actually lose money if the vault is slated to return ~35% APY


[08/05/2022 2:16 PM] ONI#6888

[08/07/2022 11:27 PM] tommycanal#4389
these keepers asleep or what?


[08/07/2022 11:30 PM] tommycanal#4389
the crv3crypto vault is integrated with quite  a few yield tokenisation platforms


[08/07/2022 11:30 PM] tommycanal#4389
if harvests are drawn out far longer than necessary then the yield periods can end without the recent harvest having taken place


[08/07/2022 11:31 PM] tommycanal#4389
anyone holding the yield token gets rekted as the yield from the unharvested 20-30 isnt counted


[08/07/2022 11:32 PM] tommycanal#4389
then obviously the amount of users willing to speculate on the yield declines on those platforms declines for the next period and with it TVL for the yearn vault

Is there any docs describing harvesting algorithm? So far, I have found no info about it
Could you provide me with the link or explanation pls?


[08/08/2022 7:20 AM] Crolev#3404
Those are keep3r jobs. You can read the code directly on the blockchain.

For example for this harvest: https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/879906686805106698/1005520537205866587

Which has _job parameter as this address (click on Decode Input Data to see it): https://etherscan.io/address/0x2150b45626199CFa5089368BDcA30cd0bfB152D6#code

It probably will be better if go through the keep3r docs first though: https://docs.keep3r.network/

thanks @Crolev


[08/09/2022 1:21 PM] Richard Feynmann#2145
It has nothing to do with the vault or the strategy, reading that description without context might be misleading tho. In this case i think it means the price is broken in the script used to calculate gauge voting


[08/10/2022 3:35 AM] tommycanal#4389
Thanks @Richard Feynmann


[08/10/2022 3:36 AM] tommycanal#4389
This vault is well overdue a harvest, and now has a reward balance accrued that's far higher than previous harvests (rewards : TVL ratio).


[08/10/2022 3:37 AM] tommycanal#4389
The continuing delay in harvesting makes it incredibly difficult for yield tokenising protocols that have integrated with yearn (element.fi and apwine.fi for example) to function


[08/10/2022 3:37 AM] tommycanal#4389
Can you ping someone on the team to see if this can be corrected?


[08/10/2022 7:52 AM] pullup1#5465
Hi support team! I have a couple of questions regarding the v3 of yearn and potential integrations. Is there a private chat option to clarify a couple of questions?


[08/10/2022 7:54 AM] j.#6352
there is no v3 yet. for protocol integrations, please post your inquiry in #pr-marketing. someone should reach out if relevant. thanks

Max report delay for 3crypto strat is set to 3 weeks, 2.7 has passed so far. I would expect a harvest relatively soon


[08/11/2022 6:38 AM] tommycanal#4389
Brilliant, I didnt realise this is the case


[08/11/2022 6:38 AM] tommycanal#4389
Will check back on the off chance there hasnt been a harvest after 3 weeks

Yeah please do it, but it should (if not before) harvested automatically by a keeper bot

Hi, who would I need to contact about a partnership and or getting some of our farms listed on Yearn?

Hi. That's not how Yearn works. I recommend learning about it first before considering any integrations. You can start here https://docs.yearn.finance/getting-started/intro. Then here for integrations https://docs.yearn.finance/partners/introduction. Thank you.

oh, ok. Thanks


[08/13/2022 11:19 PM] j.#6352 (pinned)
That probably means Zapper is down. It's temporary but common. A workaround is to withdraw to Curve LP tokens, then go to Curve to withdraw any of the two tokens from that pool. Since you want to end in ETH, you'll have to swap either or both rETH and wstETH to ETH after that. So three steps: 
1. Withdraw from Yearn Vault to Curve LP tokens
2. Withdraw from Curve Pool to rETH or wstETH or both
3. Swap to ETH. You can do this on Curve or any of your other preferred AMM/DEX

Good evening! Hope the team is well. So I’m gonna get straight to the point. I’m an up and comer in the space and I got onto the team for defi raiders recently and am in the process of transitioning it in a much different direction. Myself and the other new members of the team have much bigger plans and want to grow raiders way past just AMAs for upcoming token launches. We are trying to move raiders in sync with a project we’re building and I just personally believe we need to be aiming higher in who we’re trying to interview. If we want to be the best, we have to learn from the best. So with that, I figured I’d see if I can land an AMA with anyone from the Yearn team (free, OF COURSE). I’m a pretty relentless person in trying to achieve my goals and learn from the best (years in special operations kinda molded me that way) so I’m reaching out to the best. If you have any interest or want to talk, hit me up anytime you’re free or is convenient. We’re just looking for an opportunity to prove ourselves and provide value to the community so I’m shooting my shot. The worst thing that happens is you say no. Give me a chance. You won’t regret it. Thanks for your time.

[08/18/2022 6:23 AM] Crolev#3404
In that case try interacting with the smart contract directly:
Go to https://ftmscan.com/address/0x0dec85e74a92c52b7f708c4b10207d9560cefaf0#writeContract
Click connect to web3 and then try to use the method 26. withdraw

yearn finance is a custodial protocol i assume? need this information for a research.

No, the funds are operated through the smart contracts code.


[08/18/2022 2:13 PM] Aribrez1#1926

YFI Buyback Auctions
As per YIP-56, we periodically buy back YFI with a portion of protocol earnings.  We’ve been experimenting with different options such as market orders on DEXes, OTC deals and, most lately, auctions. Gnosis has recently unveiled their system for batch auctions which seems like a perfect fit because it allows to determine a fair price and it’s no...

Have got a question about volatility Curve DUSD Pool yVault - for 1 year it's pretty volatile (but there are 4 stables inside), whats the matter? Here is the vault https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x30FCf7c6cDfC46eC237783D94Fc78553E79d4E9C

23 July it was only 0,28$ (-73%) of original 1$ price

When harvest is called rewards are sold and deposited back into the vault. You can read strategy descriptions at https://vaults.yearn.finance


[08/31/2022 1:59 PM] ONI#6888
yah its basically dusd losing peg to 1$ for whatever reason @Nikita91 see the cmc link for its price over time.


[08/31/2022 2:36 PM] old_frog_#6669
can you send what your address is? I can check that you actually have it @zahrek


[08/31/2022 2:36 PM] old_frog_#6669
u can delete after


[08/31/2022 4:52 PM] Nikita91#6555
Thanks a lot. I can’t figure out how often  harvesting done? Member told me at least 1 time per year, but it’s quite rare (I see stats for this poll any it’s now every 9 weeks, but no strict dates)….


[08/31/2022 6:16 PM] ONI#6888
https://yearn.vision/d/4YCbcel7k/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-exp=false&var-vaults=yvCurve-DUSD+0.3.5&from=now-24h&to=now-5m if you go to harvest section you can see the convex strategy at max is harvested by keepers once every year, and its been 12.4 weeks since harvest was called on this strategy. Since it has very low amount of assets it could take some time for it to harvest again. It looks like on curve this vault has around a 5% apy which is what the vault should be around after it harvests, minus the 2 & 20 fees it would lower to around 2%.


[08/31/2022 6:23 PM] Nikita91#6555
Oh, I see, but on Yearn Finance vault is 58,3% in description. How it can be?


[08/31/2022 6:27 PM] ONI#6888
good question will look into this


[08/31/2022 6:28 PM] Nikita91#6555
Also if where such an analytical tool for Convex?


[08/31/2022 6:39 PM] ONI#6888
generally for curve/convex vaults you can check which strategy is being used, then go to their site and see what yields they are showing, and yearn vaults will be around that minus fees


[08/31/2022 6:40 PM] ONI#6888
for dusd yah the apy is correct, my fault


[08/31/2022 6:41 PM] ONI#6888
it looks like this pool has had alot of volume (swaps) in relation to its size recently causing the curve base apy to be high this week


[09/03/2022 1:12 PM] Olivier_B#6149
Does this mean that if you withdraw the day before a harvest, you will lose a lot of money?
How the potential reward can be evaluated (e.g. unclaimed reward in the ConvexPool)


[09/03/2022 2:35 PM] ONI#6888
You would lose out on yield yes, but if you move to a higher volume / higher yielding vault it would most likely be worth it imo

[09/05/2022 10:30 PM] ONI#6888
try to withdrawal in weth


[09/05/2022 10:31 PM] ONI#6888
its a zap(portal) error you should be able to withdrawal weth no problem though


[09/05/2022 10:31 PM] ONI#6888
also you could try to up slippage in the settings


[09/05/2022 10:33 PM] ONI#6888
seems like atm hardware wallets are having problems with permit signed withdrawals, you can disable permit in the settings.


[09/05/2022 10:35 PM] ONI#6888
are you connecting ledger through metamask or directly?


[09/05/2022 11:38 PM] KeithP#0640
Hi Yearn Finance
Vaults in Fantom show I have holdings of $60.20. Something I have forgotten I guess.
But I can't find what I click to figure what this is and how I manage it.
What do I click please to understand more detail about this $60.20 of holdings please?

Thanks old_frog
I am a regular user of DeBank and Yearn does not appear for my MetaMask Fantom listing. Yet a Yearn holding of $60 is seen in the Yearn on site screen capture above.
I also tried Nansen for my MetaMask in Fantom and Yearn does not appear there also.
Baffling...

Hi we are trying to cover yearn v1,2,3 on our portfolio dashabord but currently are a bit confused by V2/V3. Currently we see that the same  contract appears on both v2 and v3??


[09/08/2022 3:29 AM] j.#6352
v1.yearn.finance is v1 UI hosting v1 contracts. vault tokens have y- prefix. The Earn product is also here, which also has y- prefix. v2.yearn.finance is v2 UI hosting v2 contracts. yearn.finance is v3 UI hosting v2 contracts. v3 contracts are not out yet

yes you can do it on etherscan. just use the vault contract address you see in the URL. no need to input an amount when you withdraw


[09/15/2022 12:15 AM] arberx#3367
U have 1500 eth in yearn?


[09/15/2022 12:16 AM] arberx#3367
No it’s fine. Thats a lot lol


[09/15/2022 12:18 AM] arberx#3367
Hmm. Can u try to withdraw from zapper?


[09/15/2022 12:18 AM] old_frog_#6669
i dont think we use zapper anymore for vaults


[09/15/2022 12:18 AM] arberx#3367
Shouldn’t they still support withdrawals?

[09/15/2022 12:19 AM] arberx#3367
4 eth should be fine


[09/15/2022 12:19 AM] old_frog_#6669
withdrawing 1500 eth might need to use that much gas tbh

But not 4 eth worth


[09/15/2022 12:19 AM] arberx#3367
That quote of 800 makes sense

Might try a smaller amount


[09/15/2022 12:27 AM] arberx#3367
(100k)


[09/15/2022 12:27 AM] arberx#3367
See if gas estimate is much lower (meaning less complex transaction, higher chance to succeed)


[09/15/2022 12:27 AM] arberx#3367
I’m just speculating


[09/15/2022 12:28 AM] arberx#3367
Yes there are a variety of strats


[09/15/2022 12:28 AM] arberx#3367

Hi, I have a question regarding the eth-steth strategy. I joined this strategy with ~20 CRV ETH/stETH tokens that at the time meant a basket of 10 ETH and 10,59 stETH - staked eth was trading at a discount because it was during the aave leverage crysis. Over time stETH price has come closer to 1:1- which I expected to increase the part of eth and decrease the part of steth in my basket. But far from that, my current basket has ~6 ETH and ~14stETH. What happened?


[09/15/2022 5:27 AM] j.#6352
where do you see this?


[09/15/2022 5:44 AM] kx9x#3778
That ratio seems about right to me

[09/15/2022 5:46 AM] kx9x#3778
Exchange rate is not even close to 1 so I am not sure where you got that idea from


[09/15/2022 6:14 AM] MadCake#5927
nvm, I think my basket got distorted at the time I added liquidity in curve. My process was
1. swap 10 ETH for whatever steth, which resulted in 10,59 stETH
2. add 10 ETH and all my stETH to curve pool -> which I think resulted in exchanging some of that additional 10 eth to steth. oh well


[09/15/2022 6:14 AM] j.#6352
yeah you could just deposit ETH on its own too


[09/15/2022 6:14 AM] MadCake#5927
yep I didnt notice that at the time 😄

If you are going to deposit into curve you might as well just put in whatever side gives you the best bonus pricing

[09/15/2022 11:55 AM] kx9x#3778
Because curve doesn't care what ratio you put in when it comes to withdrawing


[09/15/2022 11:56 AM] kx9x#3778
Depositing into the LP is entering a pool that is like 32% eth and 68% steth, so that's the ratio you get pulling out as well


[09/15/2022 11:57 AM] kx9x#3778

Hi all,
 New to Yearn and deposited funds today into a vault (yVault(USDT) to be specific)). However, I don't see my funds in the Vault under portfolio. The Transactions on Etherscan follow this order:

1) Deposit: +YVUSDT and -USDT (from wallet)
2) Withdraw: +USDT and -YVUSDT
3) Transfer the deposit amount to the USDT token contract 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7

It this normal behavior? I am looking through https://docs.yearn.finance/ to see if the order of operations is documented, but I cannot find anything. Apologies ahead of time if it is already documented 🙂  Thanks all.


[09/17/2022 7:17 PM] Crolev#3404
By transferring the deposit amount to the USDT token contract do you mean that you manually sent your funds to that smart contract address?
If yes then those funds are permanently lost, but try contacting Tether anyways because they might mint new tokens to cover those that you permanently burned.
If not and I misunderstood then please DM me your address so I can take a look at the transactions you've made.


[09/17/2022 10:02 PM] defivert#1308
Hi @Crolev Thank you for your response. No, it was not sent directly, just following the instructions for this vault -> https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x3B27F92C0e212C671EA351827EDF93DB27cc0c65. I will DM you my address. Thanks again.

If it hasnt harvested then there wont been anything earned yet. So depends when you deposited. You can check harvests here https://yearn.vision/d/4YCbcel7k/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-exp=false&var-vaults=yvCurve-stETH+0.3.0&from=1663289544979&to=1663604692520

you deposited sometime around where my mouse is, thus since you deposited, harvest has not been called, share price hasn't been increase, and you have gained no yield like the website says. Just wait till the vault harvests and you will see profit on the website

Hi, I'm Jatin, CEO of BlockDogDOTxyz, a blockchain data intelligence product with a focus on crypto credit score. Yearn's lending could be safer & smarter with BlockDog's integration. 

We calculate a wallet's credit score by fetching its history from multiple protocols & blockchains like
- borrow-repayment history
- debt ratio 
and many more that are correlated with defaults. Yearn can also leverage our machine learning APIs to classify millions of wallets into unique categories and get actionable post-loan insights to track real-time credit health.

Our machine learning models trained on 100k wallets predict liquidations with 97% accuracy. This will not only introduce efficient use of capital but also incentivize users to lend/borrow on Yearn.

Who can I speak with regarding partnerships? Thank you!


[09/29/2022 11:11 AM] j.#6352

Hey, I needed some help figuring out where I can find my rewards. I deposited two days ago into the Curve stETH Pool yVault (Curve stETH) vault but as of now EARNINGS doesn't show anythingIs it because it takes a while for earnings to appear or is there something buggy with Yearn. In other words, the vault shows my deposit balance but I have no idea where to see and find me earnings/rewards from the vault

Anyone know why the curve steth pool vault APY shows as 4.81% while Lido shows a 5.6% APR? Shouldn’t the pool APY be higher?


[09/30/2022 8:26 PM] ONI#6888
looks like its 6.5% then 4.8 after fees. Also the pool is composed of only half st-eth which earn staking yield. But the curve pool does give swap fees as well.


[09/30/2022 9:04 PM] rubeo#0918
So realistically, you may only see higher yields than via staking alone (through Lido) if the volume on swaps in the curve pool is higher than it is now?


[09/30/2022 9:26 PM] ONI#6888
or curve whales direct more curve emissions to the pool, + yes swap fees so its highly possibly it will get more yield idk historically how much that was the case or not

Hello! is there any chance I get in touch with someone in the Biz Dev or Project Management team regarding a proposal for your protocol? I'm with the Telos blockchain and we'd be interested in discussing possible expansion if you're interested? We're an EVM Layer 1 blockchain so contract interoperability and such wont be an issue and we offer a range of measures of support for projects in our ecosystem. We're currently pushing a big DeFi initiative in order to increase TVL and Defi activity on chain - part of that is through our Telos Fuel Liquidity program which incentivizes partners and rewards users over the 14 month long period we have for the initiative, and we'd love to have you on board!

Unfortunately it seems that the "Earned" (Ganado) field amount is broken on the frontend, it does not affect what happens on the blockchain, you still get roughly 20% yield every time strategy in that vault gets harvested.


[10/06/2022 7:14 PM] Crolev#3404
If you want to see how much you have earned since deposit then you can check how much you've deposited on the deposit transaction in etherscan and compare it against number of vault tokens you hold times pricePerShare attribute on the vault token contract. It's rather advanced so I recommend to just wait until it gets resolved.


[10/06/2022 8:09 PM] DrSpirit#7527
But, I tried get out (retired) the toket. But it is not possible, is available to deposit nider retire, Why?  I have the idea that the token is there, But I cant take it!!

On the vault token page:
https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x1635b506a88fBF428465Ad65d00e8d6B6E5846C3
Click on withdraw (Retirar) without changing any tokens. It will give you back curve pool tokens which you can redeem for either cvx or eth on curve: https://curve.fi/cvxeth/withdraw

If you mean that you put a different token into the vault then you should understand that you 'zapped' it. This means that on the way to the vault that token was traded for the tokens native for this vault.

You should wait until veYFI comes out which hopefully should be soon.

Hello.
Maybe someone can help. An odd thing on Fantom.

The Dashboard shows I have an amount deposited. Clicking through the vault, that page also confirms so, earning 2.11% (as of this writing). The only vault with this percentage is WFTM. However, no amount to be withdrawn is showing...

Is there maybe a deprecated vault? If so, how to withdraw from those?

Thank you for any related advice 🤝

Under Vaults / Holdings: "Dollar Amount" and APY 2.11% - it doesn't display what vault it is deposited in.

Vaults Page:
Holdings, same amount.
Then, in the list, the currently only asset yield with 2.11% (that based on the dashboard display I presume it is in) is WFTM.
Yet, opening the vault, then "withdraw" there is nothing shown as deposited.

Not much more that a screenshot would show.

Question 24:
How often does a vault harvest?
Answer:
Some vaults do it every few hours, and some can take up to a week. V2 vaults harvest is distributed over 6 hours to prevent sandwich attacks. Strategies harvest at the opportune time to maximize rewards. Generally, it is best to stay in the vault long term for the best yield accumulation.


[10/15/2022 6:44 PM] arberx#3367
lots of factors in calculation

Hi all, Im trying to withdraw from the ETH-CRV vault but i keep getting the message "Error populating transaction. Make sure you have enough funds for gas fees." Despite having a healthy amount of ETH in my metamask wallet. Any idea what im doing wrong. I even added a little bit of eth but im still getting the message


[10/16/2022 6:37 PM] arberx#3367
depending on the vault/gas fees it could be a lot more than you expect


[10/16/2022 6:37 PM] arberx#3367
I would suggest trying again later


[10/16/2022 6:39 PM] MakMot#6733
ok


[10/16/2022 6:41 PM] Crolev#3404
Also try withdrawing to the same asset that is underlying for the vault. In this case it would be eth-crv curve pool tokens.


[10/16/2022 6:41 PM] MakMot#6733
I did try that actually but no tokens ended up in my metamask wallet


[10/16/2022 6:44 PM] Crolev#3404
Weird, are you sure that you clicked max on the withdraw widget? Could you please post the screenshot of what you see there before you click withdraw?

[10/16/2022 6:44 PM] Crolev#3404
also are you sure that the first transaction wasn't just permission for the smart contract to use your tokens?


[10/16/2022 6:45 PM] MakMot#6733
it could have been. I guess the question i would have is. If i do withdraw the LP tokens like your suggesting. How would i convert those tokens to usable token such as eth or USDC


[10/16/2022 6:46 PM] Crolev#3404
You can withdraw eth from those tokens on Curve: https://curve.fi/crveth/withdraw

[10/17/2022 2:41 PM] Defi Eren#4305
hey guys, wanted to ask about yCRV:
1) Is it redeemable at any point? or if i convert my CRV to yCRV - it's locked forever there? Is CRV/yCRV Curve pool is the only way out of yCRV?
2) It shows more than 100% APY for staked yCRV. In which token rewards this APY is distributed?
Thanks!


[10/17/2022 3:05 PM] Crolev#3404
1) yes, you cannot withdraw CRV from yCRV. You can only sell yCRV.
2) it is distributed as growth of pricePerShare of the vault so you can withdraw more yCRV tokens than you initially deposited with the same amount of st-yCRV tokens.


[10/17/2022 3:13 PM] Defi Eren#4305
thank you!!!

[10/17/2022 4:05 PM] Crolev#3404
Staked yCRV


[10/17/2022 4:06 PM] hammer77|#8626
so i stak ycrv and ill get st ycrv?


[10/17/2022 4:11 PM] Crolev#3404
You stake ycrv to get st ycrv tokens and if enough time has passed you will be able to withdraw the same amount of st ycrv tokens for more ycrv than you initially deposited.


[10/17/2022 4:14 PM] hammer77|#8626

[10/17/2022 10:48 PM] j.#6352
vaults are forever


[10/17/2022 11:13 PM] manosx#4809
Hi all, please bare with me on this. There’s either something wrong with the UI, or something else. 

For the past 2+ months the APY for all ibXXX vaults has been between 15-25% (was around 25% in August and down to 15% in September). Very recently dropped to 4%.
I have been stacking for 2+ months and deposited 2 harvests ago. First harvest (mid September) that did not payout (is this some sort of balancing?) and second one that did payout a few days ago. What I earned is around 0.53% of my deposit - for two months. So a 3.2% APY.
Does this mean the UI was making wrong calculations for last few months?
Maybe the harvest wasn’t fully executed (ie maybe rKP3R that convex was streaming in addition to CRV&CVX wasn’t harvested)?

Something must be wrong. Numbers don’t make sense.
Based on my napkin month, the 2 month payout should have been at least a 2.5% (for a median APY of 15% that was presented)

thank you!


[10/17/2022 11:44 PM] Buster Posey is a HoFer#3482
hello, i was going through my crypto shit for the first time in months and when i visited yearn it says I have a sizeable chunk of change in a vault earning .70% APY. however every vault I click on is empty. debank shows nothing, can't find the transaction in my wallet but yearn is still saying I have money deposited. is it possible its a UI bug? as far as I can remember I withdrew everything I had from the platform.


[10/17/2022 11:48 PM] j.#6352
yup some UI thing. if you have no yv- tokens, you have no deposit

Thank you for gettting back to me! This is regarding the Curve ibEUR pool (ibEUR/sEUR).


[10/19/2022 12:03 PM] manosx#4809
Its APY was 15-25% for past 2-3 months and payout is very small. So maybe it's a UI issue that occurred in August September or something else.


[10/19/2022 12:11 PM] manosx#4809
Payout is kind of every other month and then this type of harvest that also happens every other month is something like vault rebalancing? https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/879906686805106698/1021396173069746196

It just doesn't show up twice. Since you already have holdings in it then it is "pinned" for you to the top. If you disconnect your wallet or use a different address then it will be on the opportunities list.

[10/26/2022 3:59 PM] ONI#6888
the deposit limit seems to be an old alert I would guess, if you go to the y.w page it should a deposit limit of 
1,000,000 yvCurve-3Crypto


[10/26/2022 4:17 PM] ThanksSkeleton#9425
@ONI ok, thanks. Is yearn.watch a good website to use to check on yearn vaults? or too outdated.

Is there a known reason why the past couple harvests for this vault are 0? https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/879906686805106698/1027717662828150785

If is there a way you suggest I investigate the 0 harvest myself that would also be fine


[10/26/2022 10:20 PM] ONI#6888
it's up to date just the alerts dont have timestamps it seems


[10/26/2022 10:27 PM] ONI#6888
Not all harvests sell rewards into the base token sometimes its just to update a strategies paramaters. 
Seems like this vault harvests roughly once a month

thanks for your help, makes sense now.


[10/28/2022 8:02 AM] Bahjiggyboo#9991
What happens if you submit a transaction for a large withdraw from a V2 vault which does not have enough tokens sitting idle in the vault contract? (because there being used by the strategies). Will it just withdraw what's available and I'll then have to wait for the vault to withdraw more from the strategies (and then withdraw the rest) or will my initial transaction actually withdraw what's available AND from the strategy also?


[10/28/2022 8:08 AM] arberx#3367
The strategy as well


[10/28/2022 8:08 AM] arberx#3367
It will rebalance


[10/28/2022 8:08 AM] arberx#3367
Gas will be higher


[10/28/2022 10:38 AM] Bahjiggyboo#9991
Ok, so I'll pay extra gas to pull from strategy if necessary. Pretty well thought out system😇

Hello, is there a way to contact a dev for some support? i have a couple of inquiries regarding the Yearn boosted system.


[11/01/2022 5:30 AM] Crolev#3404
Just ask the questions here


[11/01/2022 5:51 AM] NP#6715
specifically if the function `_change_gauge_weight` was called on mainnet and not testing, it causes some issues which are to be expected since there's a devnote there that says only for testing. But the question is, is there a way to fix the gauges if the function was called? Calling it seems to have caused `_get_weight` to revert everytime a user tries to deposit/withdraw from the gauge.


[11/01/2022 6:03 AM] Crolev#3404

[11/01/2022 1:23 PM] Crolev#3404
As you can see the share price went from 1.0 to 1.019995 over the last 30 days. If we annualize it as APY like that: 1.019995^(365/30)-1 then we get 27.23% APY which is roughly what you see in the UI. The actual calculation probably uses different compound term which could account for the difference.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/01/2022 1:24 PM] Crolev#3404
Firstly you need to understand the difference between APR and APY


[11/01/2022 1:24 PM] Crolev#3404
The first one is yearly yield assuming no compounding and the other one assumes that you will compound your gains


[11/01/2022 1:25 PM] Crolev#3404
So the APR percentage will always be lower than APY percentage, but both numbers are accurate and describe the same process

Go to the strategies tab, click on details of individual strategies and in the reports tab you will see most recent harvests and how often they are done.

How can apy be 6.6 if each singular strategy has a lot lower apy?


[11/04/2022 9:16 AM] Crolev#3404
The APY you see on yearn.finance is based on the actual performance over the last 30 days which you can check here:
https://yearn.vision/?orgId=1&refresh=5m&viewPanel=24&from=now-30d&to=now
(select yvWETH 0.4.2 ETH on the list on the right)

As you can see over that time frame share price (which represents the ratio of vault tokens to the underlying tokens and its growth is how you get your yield) grew from 1.015990 to 1.021514. This means that the annualized APY is: (1.021514/1.015990)^(365/30)=1.068 so close to what you see in the UI.


[11/04/2022 9:16 AM] Crolev#3404
What you see in the individual strategies is couple last harvests so it's kind of comparing apples and oranges.


[11/04/2022 9:18 AM] Crolev#3404
Unfortunately neither option will give you a definite answer as to what the future yield will look like because it's impossible to predict, but if you deposited 30 days ago and held ETH in the vault until now then the actual real yield you got is indicative of ~6.6-6.8% APY.


[11/04/2022 9:19 AM] Cuter#4882

I am trying to convert "Curve ibAUD" into eth. What service do you recommend?


[11/07/2022 7:20 AM] Crolev#3404
Are you holding the curve pool tokens or yearn vault tokens? If the latter then withdraw curve pool tokens from yearn.finance first and then go to curve.fi, withdraw either sAUD or ibAUD and trade it for something else. Unfortunately it seems that the pool is heavily unbalanced agaisnt ibAUD so keep in mind that you might pay high slippage for the trade.


[11/07/2022 7:28 AM] Crolev#3404
The current period is right now for the CRV rewards being distributed to the curve pools, which means it was already voted on.
The pending period is for the future curve pool rewards, so you are voting for it now. Keep in mind that those APY levels might change as more people cast their votes.

[11/07/2022 5:07 PM] the_carrera#8931
Under deposits it has a value but a 0 for balance. I tried hitting withdrawal under “deposits”


[11/07/2022 5:07 PM] the_carrera#8931
It just blurs.


[11/07/2022 5:11 PM] Crolev#3404
When I try to make a deposit I see that UI for some reason values LUSD at $0 which could be causing problems with smart contract routing. I reported this to the web team so that hopefully it gets fixed soon.

If this withdrawal is an urgent matter to you and you can't wait until web ui gets fixed then you can click on the etherscan icon (which is next to the vault name on the vault page) to go to the contract address in etherscan. Then click on the Contract tab and click on Write Contract button. Then scroll down to 26. withdraw method and click on it to make a withdrawal by interacting directly with the smart contract.


[11/07/2022 5:12 PM] the_carrera#8931

Thank you for the screenshot, I will forward this to the web dev team. 
Could you please try to also go to the vault list on https://yearn.finance/vaults and click on the Deposit button there?
It should open a modal for you.

Hello, sorry for the problem. It's caused by subgraph still being down and it's being worked on by devs already.


[11/09/2022 7:46 AM] Crolev#3404
If you need to withdraw from your vault right now and you can't wait for UI to get fixed then you can do it by interacting directly with the smart contract on etherscan. The short tutorial how to do it is here: https://discord.com/channels/734804446353031319/734811808401063966/1039270802807332944

No worries im@good just wanted to make sure it wasn’t something bad. You guys are best in the business so I figured it was prob some sort of temporary update or@sometning. Thanks for@letting me@know@. Ironically just took out my mim@from@mim@vault on yearn fantom@. I’ve read one million tweets and articles saying Mim is now@battle tested and proven safe and I’ve read another million tweets and articles saying it’s going to keep depegging and die@. So you know I’m just going around and making sure I can get out of my vaults if I need to. Best of luck to all my fellow@crypto defend.

my dashboard is not showing my holdings and on zapper the balance isnt adding upto what it should be?


[11/09/2022 10:35 PM] Crolev#3404
Unfortunately there is a problem with subgraph right now which affects the UI. Not sure what could be the problem on the zapper side so try also viewing your address in debank.


[11/09/2022 10:36 PM] Crolev#3404
If debank also fails then you can go to etherscan, copy the number of vault tokens you hold, click on the vault token, go to contract tab, then read contract and multiply the number of vault tokens you hold by pricePerShare variable - the result will be the number of underlying tokens you can withdraw from your vault tokens


[11/09/2022 10:37 PM] forever iron#9291
well the vault shows the correct price, its just not on the dashboard , but if its jsut a ui problem that should be resolved by yearn right?


[11/09/2022 10:39 PM] Crolev#3404
Yep, you can see this problem already being reported in this channel in the messages above. Unfortunately it's something that is very time consuming to fix.

Hey everyone, I'd like to understand how debt allocation works. Can someone from the strat team share what your simulation approach is? (Which factors considered & which model do you use?)


[11/14/2022 7:01 PM] EduCrypto#9102
I have tried again and it’s the same issue. I can’t withdraw. Please assist!  Thanks


[11/14/2022 7:03 PM] Crolev#3404
Could you please post a screenshot of what you see on yearn page?


[11/14/2022 7:08 PM] Crolev#3404
Are you asking in technical terms how does it work or 'business-wise' how do strategists decide on given % allocations to strategies?
If the first one then there is a queue of strategies, when you withdraw and vault runs out of unallocated funds then funds get pulled in order specified there. On the deposit your fund initially just sit as unallocated funds and then later Keep3r job deposits them into a strategy based on strategy allocation in the vault.
If the latter then it's based on due dilligence done on protocols - the percentage allocated should match the risk/reward ratio and obviously maximize the yield as much as possible.


[11/15/2022 5:57 AM] leon131930#3044
Thanks @Crolev! Couple of follow-up questions:
1) Can I find the withdrawal queue of strategies for a given vault somewhere?
2) What statistical model do you use for simulating APY /yield? (would be great to get some more details here)
3) Who is doing the simulations, the strategist or somebody from governance?
4) Regarding risk categorization, is everything on https://yearn.watch/risk or am I missing something?
Thanks again for your support.


[11/15/2022 6:07 AM] Crolev#3404
> 1) Can I find the withdrawal queue of strategies for a given vault somewhere?
Go to the vault contract on chain (i.e. https://etherscan.io/address/0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c#readContract), go to the contract tab and then read contract and click on 23. withdrawalQueue. Then start by entering 0 and following with next integers until you run out of contracts.
This is the actual order configured in the vault on-chain.
The order you see in the strategies tab in year.watch should be the same. (i.e. https://yearn.watch/vault/0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c)

> 2) What statistical model do you use for simulating APY /yield? (would be great to get some more details here)
> 3) Who is doing the simulations, the strategist or somebody from governance?
The APY is based on actual past returns over the last 30 days. Yield is distributed to the vault as growth of pricePerShare every harvest so it's calculated as the pps at the end of the period divided by pps at the beginning and then annualized.
Obviously past performance is not indicative of future returns, but if someone held funds in the vault between 30 days ago and today then this is the actual yield they got.

> 4) Regarding risk categorization, is everything on https://yearn.watch/risk or am I missing something?

Hi Guys. I am retard so bare with me.
If i deposit into Curve stETH Pool yVault (Curve stETH) do i earn the CRV and CVX daily? And If i withdraw my stETH do I get the original balance back or the higher balance that has been rebasing?


[11/17/2022 6:32 AM] j.#6352
Yes but you do not get to hold those tokens. The vault reinvests those for you. If you withdraw stETH, you get whatever was earned +/- slippage and pool balance etc


[11/17/2022 6:34 AM] TΞTRA.COLLECTOR#1082
Thank you. Is there any way to see what the +/- spliggape is currently on Curve stETH


[11/17/2022 6:34 AM] j.#6352
yes. see the stETH pool on Curve


[11/17/2022 6:37 AM] TΞTRA.COLLECTOR#1082

[11/17/2022 6:39 AM] TΞTRA.COLLECTOR#1082
There is about a 1.8e difference between steth and the curve pool eth when i put my balance in

[11/21/2022 3:19 PM] Crolev#3404
It means that unfortunately portals.fi didn't find and efficient zap path and you have to first withdraw ycrv from the vault and then trade it to eth yourself (use curve.fi).

Sometimes things can  by so easy, that i never find it out by my self. Thank you!!!

Hello! I am trying to deposit USDC into Vaults / Curve USDPax. I get the following error: HTTP to https://api.portals.fi/v1/portal/ethereum?takerAddress ... request failed (status 400 )   What can be wrong?


[11/22/2022 1:23 PM] Crolev#3404
This means that unfortunately portals cannot find an efficient zap path for you and you need to obtain curve pool tokens yourself, which you can do here:
https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-59/deposit
Then you can take those pool tokens and deposit them into yearn vault.


[11/22/2022 1:27 PM] tdcarl75#3872
OK thanks

- “BlackList” preventing double dips for veCRV bribe selling, so partitioning from voters already in other dedicated bribe markets,

Can you tell me what this means?


[11/23/2022 2:55 PM] ONI#6888
where did you see this?


[11/23/2022 3:06 PM] ONI#6888
@goodboy_gooddean check here maybe https://app.pickle.finance/v1/farms


[11/23/2022 3:07 PM] ONI#6888
This should be the sushi pool https://www.sushi.com/earn/eth:0x9461173740d27311b176476fa27e94c681b1ea6b

Hello, Looking for assistance in finding the pool on Sushi which corresponds to my pSLP tokens which I just withdrew from Pickle. (it was a yvBoost/WETH position) I now have my pSLP tokens, but want to exchange them


[11/23/2022 3:10 PM] ONI#6888
you need to go to pickle and withdrawal to get slp tokens


[11/23/2022 3:11 PM] ONI#6888
they have a jar and farm withdraw from both


[11/23/2022 3:14 PM] goodboy_gooddean#3290
this UI is brutal

[11/23/2022 3:15 PM] goodboy_gooddean#3290
I withdrew from the staked area.


[11/23/2022 3:15 PM] goodboy_gooddean#3290
Idk where to go now


[11/23/2022 3:15 PM] ONI#6888
try here can you withdrawal from the sushi pool?


[11/23/2022 3:23 PM] goodboy_gooddean#3290
Na, i cant. I cant find a place that recognizes these pSLP tokens


[11/23/2022 3:24 PM] ONI#6888
yah its on pickle you need to go to the farm page and withdrawal


[11/23/2022 3:24 PM] ONI#6888
pSLP stands for Pickle Sushi LP token so you still have pickles SLP token you need to withdrawal again


[11/23/2022 3:24 PM] ONI#6888
I think you withdrew from the jar


[11/23/2022 3:24 PM] ONI#6888
now you need to withdrawal from the farm


[11/23/2022 3:26 PM] ONI#6888
zapper.fi might let you zap out


[11/23/2022 3:26 PM] ONI#6888
or you could ask for help in pickle finance's discord https://discord.com/invite/uG6WhYkM8n

Is there a reason DAI and USDC vaults aren't updating balances?


[11/26/2022 7:28 PM] Crolev#3404
What do you mean by that? The holdings change only after harvest is made, they don't "tick" up every second/minute if that was your expectation.


[11/26/2022 7:29 PM] VergiliusMar0#7631
I mean that my deposited amount doesn't increase anymore, which it did every few mins until yesterday.


[11/26/2022 7:32 PM] Crolev#3404
It could be that you were looking at the UI shortly after a harvest was made. Profit from harvest is distributed linearly over 6 hours so it is the only case when you'd see linear yield. Other than that you need to wait until a harvest is made on the underlying strategy in the vault.


[11/26/2022 7:38 PM] VergiliusMar0#7631
I see, thanks!

Go to your address on polygon scan, then on the token list click on the vault you'd like to withdraw from, on the smart contract page go to the Contract tab, and then below that to the Write Contract. Finally select the method called "withdraw" and withdraw your tokens.

Sounds like transaction simulation failed. If you are trying to zap then I recommend you to deposit/withdraw the vault native token and then just handle it further (i.e. withdraw from Curve pool or trade it into something else).

I currently don't have any position in yCRV so I can't test it myself.
I will report this issue to the devs. If this is urgent for you then I recommend trying out following things to make a withdrawal via other options:
1) Try setting the withdrawal token to the native one for the vault, so yCRV for st-yCRV and curve pool tokens for lp-yCRV
2) Try using yearn.finance too (or y.finance if that error message is from yearn.finance already)
3) Try using portals.fi directly: https://app.portals.fi/#/swap?chain=mainnet


[12/11/2022 9:47 PM] Crolev#3404
Got a request from dev asking for more info.
Could you please also show from which vault where you trying to withdraw and into which asset? Please also post the web browser console log with the error.

Hi YFI Team!

Isaac here from Quadency.com. 

I’m glad to let you know that we’re considering listing YFI on QUADX, our platform’s native exchange which combines CEX and DEX liquidity. 

Could anyone direct me to the right person to discuss a potential co-marketing campaign between YFI and Quadency?

We'd be interested in discussing any potential co-marketing activities we could run to educate Quadency’s 100k+ users about your project. If your team is interested, I would be happy to set-up a meeting with your representative and Quadency’s co-founder and Chief marketing officer.

Best,

Hello, it seems there might be a problem with zap API from portals.fi
~~Please try instead to deposit WETH instead of ETH (you can wrap it on uniswap)~~


[12/14/2022 6:41 PM] Crolev#3404
Acutally nvm


[12/14/2022 6:41 PM] Crolev#3404
it's wrong vault


[12/14/2022 6:41 PM] Crolev#3404
for this one you have to go to curve.fi


[12/14/2022 6:42 PM] Crolev#3404
and deposit into curve steth pool


[12/14/2022 6:42 PM] Crolev#3404
and then deposit tokens into the vault


[12/14/2022 6:42 PM] Liarus#1001
:WAYTOODANK:


[12/14/2022 6:42 PM] Liarus#1001
Wasn't yearn's goal to make all of this easy so i don't have to go through curve?


[12/14/2022 6:43 PM] Crolev#3404
The vaults only compound the specific token - in this case that's curve pool tokens


[12/14/2022 6:43 PM] Crolev#3404
To make deposit easier we use zaps, but it seems something is wrong with the API


[12/14/2022 6:43 PM] Crolev#3404
zaps do all the transactions for you in one


[12/14/2022 6:43 PM] Liarus#1001
Okay, could that be on my side though? I have pihole on my Network maybe that could be it?


[12/14/2022 6:43 PM] Crolev#3404
Actually you might try to use their website directly:

I try to understand veyfi. context: i have yfi but not a lot of money in the vaults because i don't have much. so i read https://docs.yearn.finance/contributing/governance/veyfi and try to understand if it make sense to lock my yfi. the text says: A user must have a **veYFI lock to continue to earn rewards**. why does it say **continue**? currently i have yfi and i earn no rewards.


[12/15/2022 4:45 PM] liptu#8490
can you give an example of what Vault Gauges are? what can i vote for? can i vote that DAI yVault has more APY? but why and how does voting increas apy?


[12/15/2022 5:02 PM] liptu#8490
One question: Does it make sense to lock if i don't have a lot of liquidity?


[12/16/2022 3:23 PM] ONI#6888
its kind of not well written. what it is trying to say is that if your lock expires in the final model you will stop earning rewards


[12/16/2022 3:26 PM] ONI#6888
This part is not yet implemented, you can only lock veYFI for voting on yip governance as per the latest in #📣announcements


[12/16/2022 3:28 PM] ONI#6888
atm there are no rewards so no, but on the website when phase 2 launches it should be able to tell you about how much boost per vault you will have, for the gauges that launch for boost

Hello there! I see Yearn Finance has updated it's UI. Thumbs up for that. Looks very nice. 
Something certainly doesn't seem right though. See the image below.
The amount of yvWETH to withdraw doesn't reflect the true amount of ETH I should be able to receive for that. 
1.9605 yvWETH should be worth around 2.01 ETH. However, it shows I will only receive 1.025 ETH for that. That's a difference of almost 50%.
2.01 ETH is what I deposited more than a month ago and when I checked earlier this week on the old UI that was still the case.
Is this just a bug in the new UI or should I be more worried? Can someone explain what's going on over here?

What happened to the old Zap feature btw?

I tried to make an AAVE deposit on Yearn, but the operation did not work. Indeed, I have an etherum debit for my transaction, available here: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa5320253dd714943d55e91ec5c6df49a3a8bc932077f5ed044cf9c6798a04a95 but nothing is displayed in my Yearn account

Any ideas?

This is the approval transaction. To make the actual deposit you need to make a second transaction.


[12/28/2022 10:48 AM] Crolev#3404
The one you made only allowed Yearn Vault contract to receive your tokens.


[12/28/2022 10:50 AM] Mercurina#6658
I tried to file my AAVEs again, but I was charged again in ETH. I would have thought that the first transaction would be the right one...

Hello. All day today I can't confirm the token exchange. I confirm the transaction in metamask and nothing happens. I have ETH on my wallet to pay the fee. What could be the problem?


[12/29/2022 12:38 AM] OhmerSimpson 🍩,🍩#0033
I see a pool listed as EURN but the EURN tokens have been deprecated by Neutrino/WAVES. Is there any reason why Y Earn would keep this listed on their website? or should it be removed? The APY advertised is very high, but there is no liquidity for these tokens


[12/29/2022 11:38 AM] Crolev#3404
When you click the button do you see a metamask transaction come up or not?


[12/29/2022 11:40 AM] Crolev#3404
Thanks for the suggestion, yeah it should be disabled - I will let the dev team know.

Hello- I have yvYFI from the retired vault.  I would like to exit so I can realize losses for tax purposes.  The migrate function on the website didn't work as the transaction reverted.  Is there a way to exit the vault using any existing UI?


[12/31/2022 1:28 AM] Crolev#3404
Depending on how long ago you've made your deposit try:
https://v1.yearn.finance
https://v2.yearn.finance
https://v3.yearn.finance

a few days ago, Sturdy announced the third part of the airdrop qualification list, which includes users who have saved more than 1 ETH in the yearn's stETH vault. I want to know how to confirm the airdrop qualification for those who have saved more than 1 ETH in the yearn's vault through the EARN interface in zk.money(AZTEC)?


[01/03/2023 9:47 AM] Crolev#3404
Well you have to ask the protocol doing the airdrop then
How would we know if they will qualify you?

Yearn’s work to automate the yield generation and rebalancing of your crypto assets is especially true in the case of your CRV holdings, and Yearn’s yveCRV or yvBOOST offers a powerful, compounding, “set-and-forget” place to stake your CRV!

The vault strategies update debt ratio when harvest is called and the strategists change it based on if they want to scale up or down a strategies tvl.

[01/05/2023 4:15 PM] CyboAngel#7681
On my end I am not sure if I am looking at an old vault or a new vault. I've just had yearn.finance bookmarked and randomly decided to check on the performance. If I am supposed to be looking elsewhere or doing something I have no idea.


[01/05/2023 4:16 PM] ONI#6888
your saying you couldnt see your funds in the old vault correct or?


[01/05/2023 4:16 PM] ONI#6888
No that is the right place it should show you your balance, but if it doesnt atm dont worry


[01/05/2023 4:22 PM] ONI#6888
you should see your funds here https://yearn.finance/vaults/1/0xdCD90C7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770B4325 and it should ask you to migrate


[01/05/2023 4:24 PM] CyboAngel#7681
I am not seeing it and am not blockchain literate enough to read the explorer and see where things are at. Too many contract calls. What do you recommend I do?


[01/05/2023 4:29 PM] ONI#6888
This is likely related to us updating the website and a bug. If you want you can dm me your address and I can show you your vault tokens. I wouldnt be worried


[01/05/2023 4:29 PM] CyboAngel#7681
Thank you will do


[01/05/2023 7:59 PM] Major#8127

Am about to deposit a significant chunk of LINK. Will those vaults be migrated soon? If so I'll hold off so I don't have to migrate

[01/06/2023 1:43 AM] bryankerr#1194
Will the curve LINK pool be migrated?


[01/06/2023 2:00 AM] ONI#6888
All curve pools will migrate to factory vaults. After someone makes it the migration will show up.


[01/06/2023 12:59 PM] guyppt#4469
So will the old vaults still earn yield?


[01/06/2023 1:31 PM] ONI#6888
Yes they will but the new factory vaults have lower fees and permissionless harvest


[01/06/2023 4:10 PM] Hipsterman#5353
I did a dumb, and I think maybe I lost $100 on impermanent loss. 
Deposited into ape.tax "Meet Your Maker-lev" Strat: https://ape.tax/meet-your-maker 

Was able to pull out a bit, but still have like 102 usdc or so that I can't migrate or pull out:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x7158c1Bee7a0Fa5BD6AFFc77b2309991D7ADCdd4

Should I just assume this is a loss or does anyone have an idea how to recoup the last bit of funds?

I have a question on risk scoring  - does the risk score (vertical axis) on yearn.watch/risk only reflect TVL impact of a strategy? And if further dimensions are included, how are those weighted? Thanks


[01/09/2023 1:11 PM] ONI#6888
Looking at this some more it seems that its expensive to migrate or withdrawal because all funds are currently in convex and they need to be unwound. You can follow this chart at Asset Graphs > assets free in vault https://yearn.vision/d/apkUMx6nz/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-exp=false&var-vaults=yvCurve-stETH+0.3.0&var-address=0xdCD90C7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770B4325&var-version=v2&from=now-30d&to=now
to see when is a good time to withdrawal cheaply. when you see that number higher than the amount you want to withdrawal it will be cheaper for you. Right now it seems migrating or withdrawal is about 50$

Sorry my understanding is this isn't a website problem, but just an expensive migration due to funds fully allocated to strategies in the vault. We did however just push a few updates to the website. lmk if you are having any problems


[01/09/2023 2:56 PM] borrito#3179
we usually refer to the horizontal axis when we say risk score, which is computed by the median value of various risk dimensions (id like to refer to the wonderful post by worms for the risk dimensions: https://medium.com/iearn/measuring-risk-for-defi-yield-strategies-b53f62b83b92)
the vertical axis reflects the TVL impact of the risk group, which is computed from the sum of the TVLs of the strategies under the same group

Hi there, first time using yearn 👋 

https://yearn.finance/vaults/1/0xc97232527B62eFb0D8ed38CF3EA103A6CcA4037e

On the  LP Yearn CRV Vault page, does `Balance, lp-yCRV` include the amount in `Earned, yCRV-f`? And if no, do I need to claim the yCRV-f from somewhere?

Hi everyone, 
I came to the new landing site for yearn and noticed that it is updated. I was in the steth pool and found that it is recommended that we migrate to  a new one. I noticed that the new one is in the factory section and has very low TVL. Is that normal, is it because its a new pool or are people not using it and staking somewhere else? Also, the last i remember the curve steth pool had 70 million in TVL where did that go?


[01/10/2023 3:45 PM] Kenshiro#7911
ok, thank you! 🙂


[01/10/2023 4:37 PM] ONI#6888
yes that is normal the vault was just released and people are in the process of migrating


[01/10/2023 4:38 PM] ahmedcoe#0233
Thanks


[01/10/2023 4:38 PM] ONI#6888
https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/steth/deposit yes it has almost 1b in tvl


[01/10/2023 6:14 PM] ONI#6888
This vault was set to not accept deposits becuase the apy was high on low tvl, it might say it has an apy of 50% ect but the curve pool has $4k tvl in it atm and any deposits will tank the yield. https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-32/deposit if someone were to vote for the curve gauge for crv rewards we'd be more than happy to deploy a factory vault for this pool, but at the moment it doesn't make economic sense to do so.


[01/10/2023 6:17 PM] ONI#6888
Yearn has to deploy factory vaults which already had production vaults avaliable. We deployed the ones which made economic sense (tvl + crv rewards) to do so. A few weren't deployed, and the ibxx-usdc vaults are among those.


[01/10/2023 6:35 PM] Kenshiro#7911
there is also a Convex Finance pool for this


[01/10/2023 6:36 PM] Kenshiro#7911
here search ibKRW: https://www.convexfinance.com/stake


[01/10/2023 6:37 PM] Kenshiro#7911
my question is if the Vault is working (someone is triggering compounds) or I  should invest directly in Convex to earn both CRV and CVX rewards


[01/10/2023 8:08 PM] ONI#6888
This specific vault ibkrw-usdc has deposits closed due to low tvl/yield.


[01/10/2023 11:23 PM] adamg82#1333
Hey guys, I hadn't connected to to yearn in a while, and it turns out my vault no longer exists (CRV steth).  The protocol recognizes I have the old tokens and a migrate button shows up.  I click it, but my ledger wallet is having a tough time with the transaction.  Is there another way to migrate?


[01/11/2023 2:59 AM] old_frog_#6669
will pass it on to devs, may need to do a manual function

[01/12/2023 1:43 AM] Hipsterman#5353
Yield is realized during harvests. Strategists maintaining Yearn Vaults have different harvest strategies. Some harvests occur more often than others because they may be dependent on other factors – including Vault balance and market conditions.


[01/12/2023 1:44 AM] TheRealTuna#1036
Yes, I just wanted to confirm it's locked forever as I won't be able to vote on yearn v1.

[01/14/2023 8:19 AM] yakitori#2367
Hi, I have st-yCRV deposited and earned some yCRV. How can I harvest that earned yCRV? Is there any interface for that? (like harvesting CAKE in PancakeSwap)


[01/14/2023 8:30 AM] Crolev#3404
You don't need to make manual harvests. They are done automatically through keep3r jobs. While the amount of st-yCRV tokens in your wallet will remain constant the price per share will grow which means you will be able to withdraw more yCRV in the future than you deposited in the past.


[01/14/2023 8:32 AM] Crolev#3404
If the decoded input data of harvest tx has _job parameter then it's a keep3r job executed by a bot.

I need some assistance.  It has been a while i since I visited yearn.  I have a holding in the Curve stETH pool.  Site says I have to migrate to the current vault.  When I try the transaction fails or says I do not have enough for gas.  I do have enough ETH for gas.  How do I resole this?


[01/16/2023 11:15 AM] DukeMittens#2494
How exactly does one withdraw their st-yCRV? Vault shows how much st-yCRV I have in Yearn, but I cannot find a way to withdraw. The docs don't seem to indicate how to do this with the redesigned site. Thoughts?


[01/16/2023 12:02 PM] Crolev#3404
Try to instead make a withdrawal from the vault and deposit into the other steth vault.


[01/16/2023 12:04 PM] Crolev#3404
You can withdraw yCRV using either https://yearn.finance/vaults or https://yearn.finance/ycrv UI.
Then if you want to sell your yCRV then you can do it on Curve: https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-192/swap


[01/16/2023 6:53 PM] youngest investor#0289
There is no where to withdraw.  This is what it shows.  I try to migrate but the transaction either fails immediately or says I do not have enough ETH for gas, but there is enough.

No, there is no transaction.  It just shows transaction failed or says not enough gas.

I let our web team know about this issue. Sorry about this.
If you need those funds urgently then let me know and I will walk you through how to make a withdrawal in etherscan by interacting with the smart contract directly. If it is not urgent then I recommend to wait until web team fixes the frontend.


[01/17/2023 11:18 AM] ONI#6888
So you don't get a transaction to sign in your wallet or you do and sign it but it shows failed on etherscan?

Can you try again? I dont see any that have reverted on the migration contract recently @Tomz84 I do however see a few that were sent with low gas and are still pending?

What's the difference between Gross APR and Net APY?Are they after tax(I mean the performance fee)?


[01/18/2023 11:29 AM] Crolev#3404
Net APY is what you get and this is the APY shown in Yearn UI.
Gross APR is the yield before fees and can be seen in the tooltip that shows when you hover your mouse over APY.


[01/18/2023 1:25 PM] Tomz84#4527
Thing is when I go to that page : https://yearn.finance/vaults I can see the pool Curve stETH Pool with the migration button and which ask well for approbation, approbation works well (i nevertheless limit it with an amount a little bite higher that my real possession) and then nothing else happens, same migration button remains and if I click on it again i am asked for approbation again :/ I could try again but already did 4 times and fees go up quickly :/

[01/19/2023 12:09 PM] ONI#6888
the factory vault or? The factory vault has yet to have a harvest so yes its normally this could take 2 to 3 weeks to show yield on your deposits.


[01/19/2023 12:09 PM] bryankerr#1194
Yes that's right. I migrated from the old version and haven't seen any apy in weeks

{Reactions}
👍 

[01/19/2023 12:10 PM] ONI#6888
The apy your getting is shown on the main site its just that the rewards (CRV) has yes to be harvested. It will happen soon


[01/19/2023 2:23 PM] screwTheJustice#0314
What's the frequency of reinvesting?Does it work by calling harvest function by some bot periodically?


[01/19/2023 5:44 PM] ONI#6888
Harvest is permissionless so whenever anyone wants to call harvest on the factory vaults it will compound the rewards into the base token. 

If you want to know how much is available to claim before calling harvest you can check this way.

For curve you can go to https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/dashboard and put in Yearn's curve voter proxy address (curve-voter.ychad.eth). It will show, for your vault, how much is available to harvest from the curve strategy.

For convex strategies and frax
claimableProfitInUsdc()
On the strats will tell you how much usd has accumulated to harvest


[01/19/2023 5:46 PM] ONI#6888
So for stETH this is what is currently claimable in the curve strategy (not the 8k, that is over all vaults, just the 574$)

I have some questions about ybribe:
1- do I need to claim everytime before current period ends?
2- does it accrue everyday? every block? how does it work for the current weeks payout formula


[01/20/2023 1:21 PM] defiglenn#3350
Hey, you do need to claim everytime. 1- The period runs from Thursday to Thursday. Otherwise you are locked out the rewards till the nexy week. 2- pretty sure it accrues daily but not 100%


[01/20/2023 1:29 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
"Otherwise you are locked out the rewards till the nexy week." i dont understand. Do I lose it permanently? or just cant withdraw that amount until 2 weeks ahead?


[01/20/2023 1:29 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
right now i have x$ claimable. if i dont claim now, can i claim several weeks in like 2 months from now?


[01/20/2023 1:30 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
or only the "previous period" will be available all rest void


[01/20/2023 1:30 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
regarding question 2 would be interesting to know also


[01/20/2023 1:46 PM] Worms#0026
AFAIK

1 - Yes, you need to claim any claimable rewards before the current period ends
2 - Rewards accrue on a weekly basis (the payout formula is based on the total amount of veCRV votes for the chosen gauge and the amount of the overall bribe)

connect wallet to etherscan, go to write contract call 25 withdrawal()


[01/20/2023 4:33 PM] ONI#6888
that will withdrawal all funds and give you the deposit token back. Sorry this is the easiest way to do this will look into how we can fix the website on this

thanks, i see that regarding 1, its really necessary to claim, otherwise it will be splitted across future week's payouts


[01/20/2023 4:45 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
however regarding the "snapshots" not sure if i understand, example: i joined mid previous period and i have some claimable balance. i wanted to understand if it was the "full week" regardless of me entering in the middle, or if i just received part


[01/20/2023 4:46 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
from your reply i see its like binary, so my veCRV votes were accounted, and i received the same proportion, as people who joined previous week from the beggining


[01/20/2023 5:09 PM] Worms#0026
understood, will go after the info for you, not sure if I will answer it today though!


[01/20/2023 5:23 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
i received more than the announced token/veCRV


[01/20/2023 5:23 PM] joaorcsilva#2787
so i assume it may have accounted for full week PLUS, unclaimed amounts from prev period

Hello. I need some help. Turns out that I just went back to check my old wallets, and find out that in Yearn site says, under the Portfolio tap, that I have a few bucks on Holdings, but I don't know where is that deposited. Any clue on how I can verify that?

what is the cheapest way to start staking yCRV?


[01/21/2023 1:37 PM] italianfoot#3914
I was buying ETH from coinbase, then swapping it to CRV via curve.fi, and then staking it through yearn


[01/21/2023 1:37 PM] italianfoot#3914
there must be a cheaper way...


[01/21/2023 2:23 PM] Hipsterman#5353
Try cowswap - I had to manually add the st-yCRV address to the token list, but it allowed me to trade ETH to st-yCRV and was significantly cheaper gas-wise.

?


[01/21/2023 2:46 PM] italianfoot#3914
can i buy with fiat? buying ETH first also involves spending more gas...


[01/21/2023 2:47 PM] ONI#6888
on cowswap no you cannot


[01/21/2023 2:47 PM] ONI#6888
its just for swapping tokens, but yes at cowswap you can swap into vaults > v0.3.4


[01/21/2023 3:18 PM] Hipsterman#5353
If you need to buy with fiat first, cheapest way I know of is going to be a cex you trust that accepts fiat payments, followed by some dex's. 
- A cex like binance or coinbase may have less fees associated with your purchase, but there may be a hold on the ETH you purchase until the bank transfer clears.
- Some dex's have the ability to use fiat purchases (like Moonpay; which can also be utilized via Metamask), but those fees can be a bit higher. These funds are usually immediately available.

[01/22/2023 11:30 AM] defiglenn#3350
Yeah it should show how much you have earned so far. How long ago did you deposit in the vault? It can be every few days to a few weeks for a harvest occur, up until your first occurrence of this your earnings would be 0

Hi, i have converted my crv into st-ycrv

when i try to see if i can swap from st-yCRV into yCRV the max button is greyed out and when i enter any number in it says insufficient balance, but when i click the drop down menu to choose what I want to swap from it shows my st-yCRV amount correctly

More than a few weeks ago. Earnings work, just does not display. Maybe because I now hold a staking composit or however you call it ? yvBoo and it earns Boo, but shows no Boo earned.


[01/23/2023 6:50 AM] defiglenn#3350
Ok thanks for letting us know. I will pass this issue on and we will get it fixed. So you are managing to earn but u can't see it on the UI? Are you finding out the amount earned by looking at the etherscan contract?


[01/23/2023 6:51 AM] GroagJI#2849
Sure. Yes either that or if I click on withdraw it also shows the correct amount with earnings included.


[01/23/2023 6:52 AM] GroagJI#2849
I guess the UI just shows the yvBoo holding,  which is static

[01/24/2023 4:58 PM] ONI#6888
Yes we have yet to harvest any rewards last I checked, they will be getting this set up this week to sell the rewards accumulated by the factory vaults. Best to just wait for now, you're earning the apy shown on the website no worries.

Currently, I'm running into a problem about swap. I want to swap yvUSDT for eth via zerion, but the liquidity is insufficient, and I also can’t swap it for other stable coins.
And then, try to withdraw via  yearn website.After linking the wallet on the yearn official website (https://yearn.finance/vaults/1/0x3B27F92C0e212C671EA351827EDF93DB27cc0c65 ), my yvusdt assets are not displayed? what should I do?

[01/26/2023 4:34 PM] defiglenn#3350
Your yv tokens are like a receipt so these will track your earnings once you deposit into that vault. Even if you move these to ledger or something and then back, or transfer it to someone else whoever has it in their wallet can redeem in from the yearn vault


[01/26/2023 8:39 PM] bryankerr#1194
So why aren't I seeing my earnings then? Lol the earnings read zero


[01/26/2023 8:42 PM] defiglenn#3350
Ok I see what you are saying. So you can see your Yearn balance which includes your deposit amount and the amount you have earned. But you can't see the amount you earned in one separate figure. Is this just saying 0 for earned? If this is what you mean I can understand your frustration. I will look to see an alternative way for you


[01/26/2023 8:47 PM] j.#6352
as mentioned above, UI spazzing out etc etc

Ok yeah I can see that is frustrating. As J says above re the UI spazzing out,  sorry about this. We will work on fixing this asap. Please be assured though that the amount you are earning hasn't changed, and will continue as normal. It will just show as your balance

I will chase this tomorrow. I'm still getting back up to speed with all things Yearn after being away for a bit, but I believe you will be able to track the earnings of your vault in the meantime by looking at how the share price changes over the period your looking at https://yearn.vision/d/eybEevXnzz/v2-vaults?orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now

[01/27/2023 9:27 AM] defiglenn#3350
So, afaik, when you are interacting, you have to approve the use of the WETH first (This is why it says on etherscan: ApprovedyvWETH For Trade On Wrapped Ether). And then also withdraw it. So there are 2 separate transactions each with gas. If you try withdrawing again, it shouldn't say approve and you can withdraw it.

Looks like rewards were just sold and it has yield now. https://yearn.vision/d/apkUMx6nz/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-exp=false&var-vaults=yvCurve-stETH-f+0.4.5&var-address=0x5B8C556B8b2a78696F0B9B830B3d67623122E270&var-version=v2 can be seen under harvest. Vault is working normally

[01/27/2023 4:03 PM] Tomz84#4527
on UI we still can't see anything :/ if i go on withdraw looks like the amount claimable is a little bit higher than the yearn deposited but yield seems working since today whereas i migrated a week ago :/ Can you confirm that the vault was never "paused" or anything ? Thanks


[01/27/2023 4:33 PM] ONI#6888
vault is working fine, harvests and yield take time best to leave it for 2 weeks or a month then come back and youll see it but the rewards are now being added to the vault as you can see above


[01/27/2023 4:33 PM] ONI#6888
all factory vaults are working normally


[01/27/2023 5:43 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
when you say time, how often is that? How often are rewards added to the principal? (I'm trying to calculate how often you compound)


[01/27/2023 5:48 PM] ONI#6888
should be once a week if it has > 500$ to claim


[01/27/2023 5:49 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
Got it, thanks. What about <$500?


[01/27/2023 5:49 PM] ONI#6888
then it will wait a week till it has 500$ of rewards or more


[01/27/2023 5:52 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
hmm.. so you're saying if rewards never cross the $500 mark, they will never be recognized?


[01/27/2023 5:53 PM] ONI#6888
It will be harvested sometime when its deemed cost efficient. This could be a month or so just depends for now the strategists are overseeing harvest but we are looking to fully automate it.


[01/27/2023 5:54 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
so if I have 1 BTC Deposited ($23K) on FTM Network (currently paying 2.82% APY) I will not recognize any rewards until month 8 of being deposited?


[01/27/2023 5:55 PM] ONI#6888
where did you get 8m from?


[01/27/2023 5:55 PM] ONI#6888
the vault factory isnt on fantom


[01/27/2023 5:55 PM] ONI#6888
this only applies to curve vaults from the vault factory on eth


[01/27/2023 5:56 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
assuming same APY (which I know fluctuates), 1 full year = $648, 3 months = <$500, so 12 months minus 3 months. 9 months not 8


[01/27/2023 5:56 PM] ONI#6888
this is for total vault tvl not your deposit


[01/27/2023 5:57 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
aaaah I see I see, sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm referring to normal vaults


[01/27/2023 5:57 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
isnt that the same? 5% of total vault, = same as 5% of portion of vault


[01/27/2023 5:57 PM] ONI#6888
depends on the strategies used, but all strategies have a max time till harvest. After that is reached the strategy should be harvested this can vary from 1m to 3m.


[01/27/2023 5:57 PM] ONI#6888
no


[01/27/2023 5:58 PM] ONI#6888
you can see harvest stats and strategy info for vaults at this dashboard https://yearn.vision/d/apkUMx6nz/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-exp=false&var-vaults=yvCurve-stETH-f+0.4.5&var-address=0x5B8C556B8b2a78696F0B9B830B3d67623122E270&var-version=v2&from=now-1h&to=now

[01/27/2023 6:08 PM] WARAMSKY#1252
Talk to me a little more about this? Or point me in a link if possible. For simplicity, lets say there are two depositors, a whale and a fren. If there's $1M deposited in a vault, and that $1M earns 10% (100K), the whale who was 900K deposited will earn 90K, and the fren who was 100K will earn 10K. 

10K out of 100K is 10%, and 90K out of 900K is 10%. What am I missing?


[01/27/2023 6:11 PM] ONI#6888
ok yes that is correct. Vault pools funds and harvests compounding rewards into the want token for all in the vault.

Hey guys! I deposited like a week ago on de st-yCRV Vault however rewards in yCRV are 0$, has there been any issue with the vault? Just farmed rewards before depositing again and everything was working fine. Should I withdraw and redeploy the funds or any fix?


[01/27/2023 9:07 PM] defiglenn#3350
Just an error in the UI. Vault working fine. Wouldn't bother withdrawing. Fix should be soon

You can see that harvests are working in the vault. Search this to see: in:🌽mainnet-harvest ycrv

You can withdraw manually using etherscan, what’s the token address?

i'm looking at the contract and there are 4 withdraw functions. which one do i use?

no need to give your address to a random person who just joined. just connect your wallet to ether scan and click withdraw under **25. withdraw**

I’ve got kind of strange issue. I withdrew coins from the 
Curve CVX-ETH Factory vault.  And I selected I wanted to receive YFI coins.  It looks like the transaction went through, I no longer have anything in the vault but the coins aren’t showing up in my wallet. 

My wallet is not registering the receipt of the coins. It also shows up in the history of my YFI coins in the wallet, but not in the history of the wallet in general. Does anyone know why the heck is going on?


[01/28/2023 11:26 PM] MarketPsychology#1663
It’s like it got lost in the cow protocol or something. Here’s the transaction hash on ether scan 0xcc0f3b019d69ce61a977f496a3892669e35a9c3c37cd981549d9a3f05b1c8009

Hi, how can I withdraw "earned yCRV" from LP and Staked Yearn CRV Vault?


[01/29/2023 8:23 PM] Hipsterman#5353
The vaults add your earned yCRV to your positions automatically. You can track your yCRV position as it grows on a wallet tracking site like debank


[01/29/2023 8:25 PM] Hipsterman#5353
You can withdraw your lp or st positions at any time - ideally when you’ve reached your yield goals, when gas is cheap, and the base CRV price is high 🙂

Hi @Crolev , been looking on yearn.vision and was surprised by the debt allocation of the stETH 0.3.0 vault
(https://yearn.vision/d/apkUMx6nz/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-exp=false&var-vaults=yvCurve-stETH%200.3.0&var-address=0xdCD90C7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770B4325&var-version=v2&from=now-2y&to=now)
Why was all debt withdrawn from StrategystETHCurve by end of May 2021, and not allocated to another strategy until June 2022?

Hey Leon, the chain says it was a strategy migration, probably not caught by vision. The harvest sent all the tokens back to the vault after setting the debt to zero. The old strat (0x979843B8eEa56E0bEA971445200e0eC3398cdB87) was changed for a new one (0x6C0496fC55Eb4089f1Cf91A4344a2D56fAcE51e3) in this transaction from May 27 2021 like 5 hours after the first strat was removed

[02/02/2023 2:43 PM] ONI#6888
I believe harvest needs to be called to allocate funds to the strategy in the gear vault


[02/02/2023 2:44 PM] dudeman9001#2830
the vault needs to be harvested to stake in the gauge?


[02/02/2023 2:44 PM] ONI#6888
yes harvest allocates debt to strategies


[02/02/2023 2:44 PM] dudeman9001#2830
so the first harvest is only based on cvx/trade fees?


[02/02/2023 2:45 PM] dudeman9001#2830
and the apy displayed doesn't take this into account?


[02/02/2023 2:45 PM] ONI#6888
No.. did you read the updated docs?


[02/02/2023 2:46 PM] dudeman9001#2830
yes, and i'm not sure what you think i missed


[02/02/2023 2:47 PM] dudeman9001#2830
if the lp isn't staked in the gauge then it isn't earning GEAR and the APY is wrong


[02/02/2023 2:47 PM] ONI#6888
the APY is correct if funds were allocated, they will be allocated when someone calls harvest on the vault. We are still working on optimizing keepers for factory vaults but the strategists should call it soon


[02/02/2023 2:50 PM] dudeman9001#2830
it just blows my mind that yearn is claiming 75%+apy for weeks on a vault that isn't even staked in the gauge yet


[02/02/2023 2:51 PM] dudeman9001#2830
so when it finally does stake i'll have missed about a month of rewards


[02/02/2023 2:51 PM] dudeman9001#2830
if it ever does considering the apr of trade/crv rewards and the size of the position


[02/02/2023 2:54 PM] Peanuckle#5973
wait, what?


[02/02/2023 2:54 PM] Peanuckle#5973
i've been pushing this vault on the gear discord :/


[02/02/2023 2:56 PM] ONI#6888
This is specific to the gear vault with lower tvl vaults they can take longer to start up. If you would like to allocate the funds to the strategy you're free to call harvest


[02/02/2023 2:57 PM] Peanuckle#5973
harvest would change the contract for the trade handler, too?


[02/02/2023 2:57 PM] ONI#6888
what do you mean? no


[02/02/2023 2:57 PM] Peanuckle#5973
he linked these


[02/02/2023 2:58 PM] ONI#6888
no its not related rewards arent showing up because there are no funds in the strategy, there are no funds in the strategy because harvest wasnt yet called on this permisionless vault.


[02/02/2023 2:58 PM] dudeman9001#2830
it looks like the gear token isn't even considered in the deployed contract

The vaults will farm and sell all reward tokens accumulated


[02/02/2023 3:01 PM] dudeman9001#2830
that's my point with the images of the two different factory vaults that have another token emission

If that is from events its probably because a harvest wasnt called on gear-eth yet is my guess


[02/02/2023 3:05 PM] ONI#6888
see totalDebt=0


[02/02/2023 3:06 PM] ONI#6888
debtRatio means this strategy should take 100% of all funds in the vault

gm, I see this on deBank so it seems I have some YFI locked in a governance pool, but I don't see it in the dashboard

Just checked out the old @iearnfinance staking contracts:

~30 YFI unclaimed in the original staking pools
~8.5 YFI staked in v1 staking contract
~764 YFI still staked in v2 staking contract with $750k in claimable yCRV 😬

Almost $29m in staked LPs, YFI, and claimable rewards 👇

In yearn.finance will I find somewhere the address of the pool on curve.fi where I need to add liquidity to deposit in yearn.finance


[02/03/2023 10:48 AM] Crolev#3404
On the vault page you see the same name of the pool that you can find on curve.fi
For example yvCurve-3pool is 3pool.

Alternatively, if you want to see the token address of the pool token, then you can click on the etherscan link on the vault page and check the base token on the vault contract address.

If you'd like to avoid doing two transactions on Ethereum (first deposit on Curve, then on Yearn) then you can consider using either something like transaction builder in Gnosis safe so you can bundle the transaction yourself or zap provider such as portals.fi that will do it for you for a small fee.

can anyone tell me if im earning rewards with my BOO in the vault as yvBOO? im confused since i didnt get the memo on what yvBOO is and how it relates to BOO?


[02/05/2023 8:10 PM] defiglenn#3350
The prefix yv stands for Yearn vault. This is your receipt for when you deposit. Each yvBOO should go up in value over time if the vault strategies performs well and so when you redeem your yvBOO you get more BOO back


[02/05/2023 8:18 PM] defiglenn#3350
Here you can see the price per share of yvBOO increasing over time https://yearn.vision/d/1fEBl8I4k/share-price?orgId=1&refresh=1d&var-networks=FTM&var-exp=false&viewPanel=21&from=now-6M&to=now


[02/05/2023 8:57 PM] Satori#6734
Thank you. What about the staking though? It was at 25% apy earlier today. Is that including in what I have or do I need to do something in addition to make it staked?


[02/05/2023 9:12 PM] divine_comedian#5493
coming back around to this - still looks to be broken. The APY also looks to be incorrect

Wanted to ask a similar question about the OHMfraxbp vault. 
Not seeing the rather OHMFRAXBP-f number go up (thought that would track the overall yield made from the vault).


[02/06/2023 11:41 AM] defiglenn#3350
Vault balances won't change but as share price increases you will earn more of the deposit token and be able to withdrawal more when you exit (your yield earned).

[02/06/2023 11:41 AM] donnysoldier#4338
Thanks for replying. 
That’s fine, I understood that. Just thought the last tab would increase to show how much I’ve earned?


[02/06/2023 11:43 AM] donnysoldier#4338
Strangely even though I’ve been in this vault for a few days. The yvToken has not increased against the original crvLP token I used 
Identical number. 

Makes me think is the vault working?


[02/06/2023 11:50 AM] defiglenn#3350
hasn't been a harvest - thats why! When there is a harvest you will see some earnings. APY comes from here: https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/mim/deposit


[02/06/2023 11:55 AM] donnysoldier#4338

Ohm-fraxbp share price is 1. 
Any idea why it’s not increasing?

@defiglenn


[02/06/2023 11:57 AM] defiglenn#3350
Hey so vault has not harvested yet. I have just checked on yearn.vision too. This is because this is a new vault. Harvests can be every few hours to every few weeks depending on when is a profitable time to harvest. Strategists wait till an optimal time when gas is low and rewards are highest. I recommend checking back in a week or so and see if there has been a harvest. You can check the #🌽mainnet-harvest to get an idea for how often other vaults are harvesting


[02/06/2023 12:05 PM] donnysoldier#4338
Cool makes sense, wasn’t sure about the harvesting time. Nice to know. 
I’ll have a look at the others

i see where i can swap from st-ycrv  to ycrv but how do i get my harvest to crv?


[02/06/2023 1:28 PM] j.#6352
vaults are autocompounding over time. you dont need to perform a harvest to realize its yield


[02/06/2023 1:28 PM] j.#6352
but you can always sell/swap your st-ycrv


[02/06/2023 1:30 PM] Dawg56#8798
what options do i have to swap or sell? Confused


[02/06/2023 1:36 PM] j.#6352
you can swap your st-ycrv back to ycrv on yearn, then swap that to crv on curve


[02/06/2023 1:54 PM] Dawg56#8798
Thanks is there any strategy other than letting it compound ?


[02/06/2023 1:57 PM] j.#6352
you could watch CRV price and CRV/yCRV ratio and trade accordingly based on how st-yCRV performs

@ONI looks like a strategy of the factory pool


[02/07/2023 8:04 PM] divine_comedian#5493
@ONI this is the vault in question if that helps


[02/07/2023 10:39 PM] ONI#6888
There has been no harvests that have realized profits yet


[02/07/2023 10:43 PM] divine_comedian#5493
@ONI Then where does this harvest go then? It is the same underlying curve LP token


[02/07/2023 10:44 PM] ONI#6888
yes but the vault has so little tvl that it is not yet profitable to call harvest on it for now best to keep waiting


[02/07/2023 10:45 PM] divine_comedian#5493
I can see the difference you're talking about but this Curve MIM Pool is where?


[02/07/2023 10:45 PM] divine_comedian#5493
Curve MIM vs. Curve MIM factory

wdym? they are seperate vaults not related


[02/07/2023 10:48 PM] ONI#6888
Your in the factory that vault has like 15k tvl so while your funds are earning yield it will take time to harvest because of the low tvl. But your still earning yield at the rate shown on the site


[02/07/2023 10:48 PM] ONI#6888
I will see if we can harvest this vault since its been a month


[02/07/2023 10:49 PM] divine_comedian#5493

[02/07/2023 10:50 PM] ONI#6888
we have a new factory vault that has 0/10 fees, factory vaults are permissionless, anyone can deploy them. You can read about them here https://docs.yearn.finance/getting-started/products/yvaults/vault-factory. We are recommending people migrate because the fees are cheaper thus you will over time earn more


[02/07/2023 10:51 PM] ONI#6888
Factory vaults are only atm for curve pool of which mim is a curve pool lp token vault


[02/07/2023 10:51 PM] ONI#6888
will check looks like the old one


[02/07/2023 10:51 PM] divine_comedian#5493
if that is so then that vault is still making pretty good bank


[02/07/2023 10:51 PM] ONI#6888
you can see harvests here as well https://yearn.watch/vault/0xa540744DEDBDA9eF64cf753F0E851EfE4a419EA9/0x9430A2501e5f2Cd66741375baAbB9576E8FB5f48

[02/07/2023 10:52 PM] divine_comedian#5493
by A LOT


[02/07/2023 10:53 PM] ONI#6888
It appears that way because if has more tvl, but each depositor in the factory vault is and will be earning more when the rewards are swapped for the deposit token on the factory vault. As I said a big reason why is the low tvl, for now you can expect harvests once a month or so unless tvl increases. I would suggest you not withdrawal since share price = 1 ie no rewards have been added back to the vault increasing share price which you can watch here https://yearn.vision/d/apkUMx6nz/vault-overview?orgId=1&var-networks=ETH&var-exp=false&var-vaults=yvCurve-MIM-f+0.4.5&var-address=0xa540744DEDBDA9eF64cf753F0E851EfE4a419EA9&var-version=v2&from=now-30d&to=now under harvest section

🥲 yfi 

[02/07/2023 10:56 PM] ONI#6888
So they have the same deposit token right from the same curve pool, so they both have the same apy. Execpt the factory has lower fees thus it will give depositors a higher apy over time


[02/07/2023 10:56 PM] ONI#6888
sorry I know it can be frustrating seeing a harvest not being called for a month on a low tvl vault but he worst thing you can do is withdrawal or you lose a month of rewards and give it to everyone else who stays in the vault

Excuse me, I have a deposit in st-ycrv, I check its increase amount every day, but today I found that it has no increase amount, and it has been more than 12 hours, what is going on?


[02/08/2023 9:58 AM] Crolev#3404
It increases with each harvest made. After a harvest the share price of the vault token grows linearly over 6 hours, but the harvest themselves can be spaced out by days or even weeks.


[02/08/2023 9:59 AM] Crolev#3404
I recommend using this chart to track the token share price growth (select st-ycrv on the list on the right):

This is normal for Yearn vaults. The yield is not linear and can vary over time. There can be periods of no yield when vault is waiting for the next harvest.


[02/08/2023 10:07 AM] Crolev#3404
Eventually there will be a harvest and the vault tokens will go up again


[02/08/2023 10:10 AM] 仓又加错| Sui Global#5159
No, no, I mean, the number of ycrv was increasing all the time before, how come it suddenly needs to be harvested again?


[02/08/2023 10:12 AM] Crolev#3404
The harvests were made more often than every 6 hours.


[02/08/2023 10:13 AM] Crolev#3404
Right now the spacing could be bigger because for example it takes longer to get enough yield so it's worth it to pay for eth gas to extract it.


[02/08/2023 10:16 AM] 仓又加错| Sui Global#5159
The income of st-ycrv does not need to be harvested, it is automatically increased by the system


[02/08/2023 10:25 AM] Crolev#3404
The automation is a keep3r job. Effectively the vault still needs a blockchain transaction to get yield. It's not linear over time like aave interest for example. There needs to be a transaction for the number to go up.


[02/08/2023 1:33 PM] *ɮʀɛǟKɛʀ*#4974
hey there, sorry for that lame noobish question… i’ve started a yCRV staking position (st-yCRV vault) days ago. it is said that i’ve already won some yCRV. how do i get them as staking rewards on yearn.finance ?


[02/08/2023 1:34 PM] j.#6352
the st-yCRV vault is autocompounding its yCRV so you do not need to do anything else


[02/08/2023 1:35 PM] *ɮʀɛǟKɛʀ*#4974
So the balance of st-yCRV should automaticaly grow, right ?


[02/08/2023 1:35 PM] j.#6352
no. st-yCRV amount remains constant, while its value increases


[02/08/2023 1:40 PM] *ɮʀɛǟKɛʀ*#4974
so this is when i swap back from st-yCRV to yCRV that i « get » the rewards with more yCRV than i had at the beginning


[02/08/2023 1:42 PM] j.#6352
Yes. you can then swap yCRV for CRV


[02/08/2023 1:43 PM] *ɮʀɛǟKɛʀ*#4974
Ok got it thanks

its not letting you withdrawal into the base curve pool token? You probably cannot zap out of it due to slippage being high


[02/10/2023 5:16 AM] brincnomics#2509
hi, what is `Want` exactly in the yearn `brownie-strategy-mix` contract?


[02/10/2023 5:17 AM] brincnomics#2509
function estimatedTotalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
        // TODO: Build a more accurate estimate using the value of all positions in terms of `want`
        return want.balanceOf(address(this));


[02/10/2023 5:17 AM] Crolev#3404
the token that the vault is compounding


[02/10/2023 5:18 AM] Crolev#3404
so for yvWBTC it's WBTC, for example


[02/10/2023 5:19 AM] brincnomics#2509
the invested currency in the vault then yea?


[02/10/2023 5:19 AM] Crolev#3404
you could say so too (as long as it wasn't exchanged from some other token on the way to the deposit, i.e. via zap)


[02/10/2023 5:28 AM] brincnomics#2509
ok thanks and what is _debtOutstanding? its the want tokens deposited or the number of vshares ?


[02/10/2023 5:30 AM] Crolev#3404
it's what the vault "owes" to the depositors
when you make a deposit to the vault you get a vault token and you eventually want to use it to withdraw the coins you initially deposited + interest from the vault


[02/10/2023 5:31 AM] Crolev#3404
in the context of the vault it's what it owes to the depositors and in the context of a strategy within that vault it's what a strategy owes to the vault


[02/10/2023 5:31 AM] brincnomics#2509
so if a user deposited 100 USDC to the vault; he would get **100 vUSDC shares** and this is the DebtOutstanding?


[02/10/2023 5:32 AM] Crolev#3404
the number of vault tokens will be different depending on the current pricePerShare


[02/10/2023 5:33 AM] Crolev#3404
let's say that current pricePerShare is 1.1 - this means that within its history the vault has already earned 10% yield


[02/10/2023 5:33 AM] brincnomics#2509
understand yes


[02/10/2023 5:33 AM] brincnomics#2509
what happens if the value falls in the strategy?


[02/10/2023 5:33 AM] Crolev#3404
if you deposit at that point 100 USDC you will get ~90.909 vault tokens


[02/10/2023 5:33 AM] Crolev#3404
then debt outstanding of the vault will increase by 100


[02/10/2023 5:34 AM] Crolev#3404
if vault gets a harvest and let's say pricePerShare grows to 1.21


[02/10/2023 5:34 AM] brincnomics#2509
still return the same number of vault tokens just with the lower pricePerShare?


[02/10/2023 5:34 AM] Crolev#3404
then you will be able to withdraw 90.909*1.21 = 110 usdc and the debt will also be 110


[02/10/2023 5:35 AM] Crolev#3404
to clarify - do you mean a situation when you want to make a withdrawal, but the tokens are still in strategy?
if that is the case then your withdrawal will pull those funds from that strategy so nothing exceptional will happen, just maybe a higher eth gas cost for transaction


[02/10/2023 5:36 AM] Crolev#3404
the current pricePerShare is what you get when you make a withdrawal


[02/10/2023 5:36 AM] Crolev#3404
it does not grow linearly


[02/10/2023 5:36 AM] Crolev#3404
it only grows every time a harvest is made


[02/10/2023 5:37 AM] brincnomics#2509
ok understand. So the value of the vTokens can go up or down; but the debtOutstanding is in terms of number of vTokens.


[02/10/2023 5:39 AM] brincnomics#2509
and the Strategy.sol contact essentially just acts as the mechanism to deposit and withdraw funds based on specific parameters. Then after the funds are desposited into the Strategy contact....how are the funds actually deposited to say a specific curve pool to generate yield?


[02/10/2023 5:39 AM] Crolev#3404
generally it only goes up in relation to the deposit token


[02/10/2023 5:39 AM] Crolev#3404
it is exceedingly rare for pricePerShare to go down


[02/10/2023 5:39 AM] Crolev#3404
something would have to go very wrong for that to happen


[02/10/2023 5:40 AM] Crolev#3404
that depends on a specific strategy contract, you can check the contract code directly on the blockchain
you can look up the vaults on yearn.watch, for example:

and in the contract tab you can read the source code


[02/10/2023 5:51 AM] brincnomics#2509
thank you. In general, does the actual investment of the deposited funds into the vault get deployed directly to the curve pools or is this done manually?


[02/10/2023 5:52 AM] Crolev#3404
when a user makes a deposit then the funds are stored on the vault contract until a keep3r job distributed them to strategies


[02/10/2023 5:53 AM] Crolev#3404
this is done like that so deposits are as cheap in gas cost as possible


[02/10/2023 5:53 AM] brincnomics#2509
ok i guess my question is is "strategies" = deposit in to curve pools?


[02/10/2023 5:55 AM] Crolev#3404
depends on the vault, if the vault has Curve in the name then it deposits either directly to curve pools or through convex if it offers higher yield, if the vault does not have Curve in the name then usually it farms several different protocols


[02/10/2023 5:56 AM] brincnomics#2509
what i mean is regardless of the protocol, does the "strategy" contract auto deploy the funds to the pools/protocols or is this done manually?


[02/10/2023 5:57 AM] Crolev#3404
something in-between
the vaults funds don't "automatically" go to to strategies because there is no true "automation" on eth blockchain and depositing directly to strategies would be gas expensive for depositors
instead there are keep3r jobs that make harvests of the profits in the vaults and as they do that they also distribute the funds from the vaults to strategies


[02/10/2023 5:58 AM] Crolev#3404
there are also rare cases when strategist multisig will trigger the distribution of those funds if too much of them pile up or if the strategies need rebalancing


[02/10/2023 5:59 AM] brincnomics#2509
understand. So do the Keep3r's actually move the funds from the vaults or strategies to the pools/protocols? and this is done manually


[02/10/2023 6:00 AM] Crolev#3404
keep3r jobs are ran by bots, there isn't a human manually clicking the transaction


[02/10/2023 6:00 AM] Crolev#3404
but from the perspective of the eth blockchain it does look like manual transaction done by EOA


[02/10/2023 6:01 AM] brincnomics#2509
interesting


[02/10/2023 6:01 AM] brincnomics#2509
and crazy 🙂


[02/10/2023 6:02 AM] brincnomics#2509
my last question for today: is it possible to deploy strategies to uniswap pools and on arbitrum?


[02/10/2023 6:04 AM] Crolev#3404
theoretically yes, in practice usually not
vaults farm specific tokens so if you deposit that into a uniswap pool then you are a subject to divergence loss (previously known as impermanent loss), they can be hedged with options, but unfortunately usually that hedge is more expensive than what the uniswap pool earns


[02/10/2023 6:04 AM] Crolev#3404
afaik there are some uniswap farming strategies on eth mainnet already, but they didn't get too big because of above


[02/10/2023 6:05 AM] Crolev#3404
generally it only makes sense if there is additional incentive on the pool beyond just the pool fees


[02/10/2023 6:06 AM] brincnomics#2509
Would it be possible for us to do this then: 1) vaults on Arbitrum 2) USDC deposited into vaults 3) funds transferred to strategy (uniswap pools) <-- done via multsig? i.e. replace the keep3r bot with a multi-sig


[02/10/2023 6:07 AM] Crolev#3404
yes, it would be possible, but Yearn vaults are generally up-only so if you deposited that into for example ETH-USDC pool then you'd get divergence loss at times


[02/10/2023 6:07 AM] Crolev#3404
but you could still make a deposit into a stable pool if you trust the other stablecoins in it


[02/10/2023 6:08 AM] brincnomics#2509
Yes, there would be divergence loss, but, would that cause a problem to the vault/strategy contract logic?


[02/10/2023 6:09 AM] Crolev#3404
no, the vault/strategy code will work normally and handle the loss


[02/10/2023 6:09 AM] Crolev#3404
it's just that people generally don't deposit into vaults to see those ups and downs


[02/10/2023 6:11 AM] brincnomics#2509
yea, understand. How could we set this up on Yearn? It looks like the factory vaults are only offered for curve pools atm


[02/10/2023 6:13 AM] Crolev#3404
You can't. The vaults and strategies within are set up by the strategist team (except for the factory vaults). If you are a holder of YFI then you could start a topic on yearn dao forum to propose those alternative vaults as an idea which then could become a DAO vote.


[02/10/2023 6:14 AM] brincnomics#2509
i see. actually is there any plan to open the factory vaults to protocols beyond curve any time soon?


[02/10/2023 6:15 AM] brincnomics#2509
This seems a little too focused on Curve only


[02/10/2023 6:27 AM] brincnomics#2509
or could we allow our users to invest in the yearn vaults indrectly through our branded vaults?


[02/10/2023 6:32 AM] Crolev#3404
yes, that can also be done along with profit sharing from the vaults

Have you tried seeing if you tokens are on v1.yearn.finance?


[02/10/2023 5:18 PM] arberx#3367
Or v2.yearn.finance


[02/10/2023 6:00 PM] ONI#6888
I wouldnt post trx details to reddit since it will let people know you crypto address, but those are only approvals. I would hard refresh yearn.finance (cntrl+shift+r) connect your wallet and it should show the migration button (not approval). You already approved the migration contract for your vault tokens, now you just need to do the actual transaction to migrate your funds. It should show on yearn.finance.


[02/10/2023 6:45 PM] ONI#6888
Will look into the approvals and see if we cant fix it


[02/10/2023 6:56 PM] Gaoez01#6811
Ok thank you!


[02/10/2023 8:57 PM] ONI#6888
I would try to revoke your approve for the vault migrator then reapprove it see if that works this is the contract to revoke `0x9327e2FDc57c7d70782F29AB46F6385afaf4503C`


[02/10/2023 8:58 PM] ONI#6888
You can do this here at https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker


[02/10/2023 9:09 PM] Gaoez01#6811
Hm that is strange. Using the token approval checker, there is no approval for any steCRV. I only see approvals for DAI from 2021 or earlier.


[02/10/2023 9:09 PM] ONI#6888
The manual process the website automates is 
1) set approve for the migration contract to spend your stETH (so it can migrate you) (withdrawal stETH and deposit into the new vault in one trx)
Do this go to https://etherscan.io/token/0xdcd90c7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770b4325#writeContract the vault contract write #18 approve 
spender address: is `0x9327e2FDc57c7d70782F29AB46F6385afaf4503C` our simpleVaultMigrator contract
amount is: # of vault decimals (18 in this case + the balance in yvtokens you have) if you have 100 yvstETH its 100+18 0's
connect wallet to etherscan and submit the approval

Next you call the migration function on the contract
https://etherscan.io/address/0x9327e2fdc57c7d70782f29ab46f6385afaf4503c#writeContract
write 2 migrateAll
vault from old stETH `0xdCD90C7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770B4325`
to new factory stETH `0x5B8C556B8b2a78696F0B9B830B3d67623122E270`
submit and it will migrate you

hm ok I will have to take a look at this later. Is there no easy way to just withdraw my tokens? When I click Details it brings me to the Old Vault page. But similar similar to the Migrate function, the Withdraw does not work either.


[02/10/2023 10:21 PM] ONI#6888
yes you can withdrawal simply by calling 25 withdrawal all https://etherscan.io/token/0xdcd90c7f6324cfa40d7169ef80b12031770b4325#writeContract

hello - have my funds in WBTC and WFTM (on Fantom Network) in Vaults for 16 days now and see 0 earnings on the dashboard. Are Vaults paused?


[02/12/2023 5:32 AM] mumblealtos#2506
Hi, can someone explain me the apy 18.18% on ycurve 3crypto. I have the funds in it for the last 5 days. In last earning (2 days 3hours and 40minutes) I get 0.01692916%. Instead of 0.10721%. So actual apy for me is like 3%???


[02/12/2023 6:01 AM] defiglenn#3350
May be an error in the UI. WBTC and WFTM on fantom are harvesting regularly, have a look on the #🌱fantom-harvest channel to see

[02/12/2023 6:11 AM] defiglenn#3350
Returns aren't regular, or continuous. They fluctuate. So to see that 18% you will have to wait and see. It's an estimate based on the past. Depends how much people use Curve to trade in the future.  Maybe last 5 days there hasn't been much traded in that 3crypto pool on Curve so thats why the return is lower.


[02/12/2023 6:13 AM] mumblealtos#2506
I do not buy this answer. Trading on curve is worth like 0.5-1.5% from apy, the rest is from curve tokens....


[02/12/2023 6:14 AM] mumblealtos#2506
When last harvested for 2.1525 days it was harvested like 1200usd when it should be harvested like 5k usd


[02/12/2023 6:16 AM] mumblealtos#2506
apy 18% or 3% is way away, we are not talking 17.5-18.5%


[02/12/2023 6:23 AM] defiglenn#3350
Here's some info from Curve about how the APY is calculated:  https://resources.curve.fi/lp/understanding-curve-pools#base-vapy , https://resources.curve.fi/reward-gauges/boosting-your-crv-rewards

[02/12/2023 6:25 AM] defiglenn#3350
The strategy being used by Yearn is: supplies crv3crypto to Curve Finance and stakes it in gauge to collect any available tokens and earn enhanced CRV rewards thanks to locked CRV boost. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more crv3crypto which is deposited back into the strategy.


[02/12/2023 6:27 AM] mumblealtos#2506
I totaly understand how the vaults works. I'm in defi from the start when was TVl in defi like 2B, and I'm in 3crypto on convex for years...


[02/13/2023 8:23 AM] donzetti#5369
Hey, team! One quick question. Before the new website, for the " Staked Yearn CRV" Vault I was able to zap ETH from my Metamask directly to yCRV. Is this no longer the case or am I missing a functionality somewhere? 🙂 Thank you!


[02/13/2023 8:28 AM] Crolev#3404
Currently the zap functionality is disabled, but if you still want to use it then you can do it using the previous zap provider website: https://app.portals.fi/#/swap?chain=mainnet
Alternatively you can also use a smart wallet or gnosis safe (if you set them up) to build a transaction that will withdraw and trade the tokens for you in one ethereum tx.

[02/13/2023 8:30 AM] donzetti#5369
Thank you so much for that explanation, @Crolev ! And thanks for the options - portals.fi seems like the most straight-forward one 🙂 . Out of curiosity - do you know the reason why Zap functionality was disabled?


[02/13/2023 8:31 AM] Crolev#3404
I don't know for sure - I will ask internally and get back to you.

Is there a way to approximate when harvests will happen. For example the ohm - FRAXBP vault has been on going getting close to 2 weeks now and no harvest. 

Is a month or so the usual time frame?

harvests and swap logic is decoupled in factory vaults. It is harvesting putting farmed crv into the strategies now they are waiting to be swapped. This should happen in the next couple of days. After its done you will get the deposit token into the strategy address, then next harvest will donate them to the vault and share price will increase. Vault is working normally.

Hello Yearn team, we are looking to integrate Yearn vaults to our dApp. I am applying for the partnership program, however, we would also like to know where the partner ID for the vaults are. Could anyone help with that please?


[02/15/2023 9:57 AM] defiglenn#3350
Hey, partnerId is just the wallet of the partner who is doing the integration. It's where the fee sharing fees go to also. More info here: https://docs.yearn.finance/partners/partner-tracker

Hello, I staked yfi token about a month or so ago. But cannot get to the staking page anymore.

What's the link? And do I automatically collect apy for staking or do I have to participate in voting?


[02/15/2023 7:49 PM] jonathan00713#5427
This is the link I originally used for staking yfi. It's not working now 

https://ygov.finance/


[02/15/2023 8:05 PM] Crolev#3404
Are you sure it's that one?
veYFI is on this page: https://yearn.finance/veyfi (no staking rewards yet, though)
If you are sure that you deposited to the old and defunct contract then please post the etherscan transaction list and I will explain how to make a withdrawal by interacting with the contract directly in etherscan.


[02/15/2023 8:07 PM] jonathan00713#5427
Hello guys I am new here ...and getting messages in my DM about how to solve my issue with staking .. how do I know that I am talking to the appropriate  yearn finance support person?


[02/15/2023 8:07 PM] Crolev#3404
What exactly is the problem?

You should be able to withdraw using https://yearn.finance/ycrv and withdrawing yCRV from st-yCRV.

How to stake YFI?
Holding YFI gives the right to claim your shares in the yearn.finance rewards contract.

To stake your YFI tokens, simply visit https://ygov.finance/ and initiate the staking transaction to the governance smart contract.


[02/15/2023 8:15 PM] Crolev#3404
They must have not updated that in 3 years. That website was used back in 2020.


[02/15/2023 8:15 PM] Crolev#3404
Anyways - please post the link to transaction on etherscan. I don't have the old contract address handy so I will need to take it from there.


[02/15/2023 8:16 PM] jonathan00713#5427
Post here ?


[02/15/2023 8:16 PM] Crolev#3404

[02/15/2023 8:19 PM] Crolev#3404
I don't think there are any anymore. That website hasn't been in use since 2020. It was kept up until recently only for people that for some reason forgot to withdraw their tokens from there.


[02/15/2023 8:25 PM] Crolev#3404
Okay, I think I might have found the old contract address: 0xBa37B002AbaFDd8E89a1995dA52740bbC013D992

To make a withdrawal follow these steps:
1) make 100% sure this is the correct contract address by comparing against your transaction in etherscan - it should be the same as the contract you interacted with in that transaction
2) go to https://etherscan.io/address/0xBa37B002AbaFDd8E89a1995dA52740bbC013D992#writeContract
3) click Connect to Web3 and connect with your wallet
4) click on option 2. exit and then on Write
5) it should prompt a new transaction in your wallet that will be a withdrawal transaction

I tried to withdraw 2x but I end up paying a fee instead of it converting back into yCRV


[02/16/2023 1:37 PM] defiglenn#3350
Maybe you didn't do enough gas for the transaction

[02/16/2023 2:34 PM] joshuaraycampo#4867
I had enough gas for both times. And I have transaction confirmations, however it’s still in st-yCRV collecting yield. Might just leave it and collect yield

I tried to deposit ETH and clicked on the Approve button. I showed a successful transaction. I then tried to deposit by clicking on the deposit button, however it was still and approve button.  I have plenty of ETH for gas. I tried it two more times and only the approve button was displayed and checking on etherscan I was charged for each approval transaction I. What should I check?


[02/17/2023 4:46 AM] defiglenn#3350
That is odd. I would try again and upping the gas amount. Maybe transactions failed because of too low gas
