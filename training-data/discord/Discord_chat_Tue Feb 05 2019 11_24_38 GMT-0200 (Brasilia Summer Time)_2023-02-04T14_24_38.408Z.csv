If the first one then there is a queue of strategies, when you withdraw and vault runs out of unallocated funds then funds get pulled in order specified there. On the deposit your fund initially just sit as unallocated funds and then later Keep3r job deposits them into a strategy based on strategy allocation in the vault.
If the latter then it's based on due dilligence done on protocols - the percentage allocated should match the risk/reward ratio and obviously maximize the yield as much as possible.","leon131930#3044",""

Thanks again for your support.","Crolev#3404",""
"2022-11-15,06:07:35","Crolev","#3404","> 1) Can I find the withdrawal queue of strategies for a given vault somewhere?
Go to the vault contract on chain (i.e. https://etherscan.io/address/0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c#readContract), go to the contract tab and then read contract and click on 23. withdrawalQueue. Then start by entering 0 and following with next integers until you run out of contracts.
This is the actual order configured in the vault on-chain.
The order you see in the strategies tab in year.watch should be the same. (i.e. https://yearn.watch/vault/0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c)

> 2) What statistical model do you use for simulating APY /yield? (would be great to get some more details here)
> 3) Who is doing the simulations, the strategist or somebody from governance?
The APY is based on actual past returns over the last 30 days. Yield is distributed to the vault as growth of pricePerShare every harvest so it's calculated as the pps at the end of the period divided by pps at the beginning and then annualized.
Obviously past performance is not indicative of future returns, but if someone held funds in the vault between 30 days ago and today then this is the actual yield they got.

> 4) Regarding risk categorization, is everything on https://yearn.watch/risk or am I missing something?

Isaac here from Quadency.com. 

I’m glad to let you know that we’re considering listing YFI on QUADX, our platform’s native exchange which combines CEX and DEX liquidity. 

Could anyone direct me to the right person to discuss a potential co-marketing campaign between YFI and Quadency?

We'd be interested in discussing any potential co-marketing activities we could run to educate Quadency’s 100k+ users about your project. If your team is interested, I would be happy to set-up a meeting with your representative and Quadency’s co-founder and Chief marketing officer.

Something certainly doesn't seem right though. See the image below.
The amount of yvWETH to withdraw doesn't reflect the true amount of ETH I should be able to receive for that. 
1.9605 yvWETH should be worth around 2.01 ETH. However, it shows I will only receive 1.025 ETH for that. That's a difference of almost 50%.
2.01 ETH is what I deposited more than a month ago and when I checked earlier this week on the old UI that was still the case.
Is this just a bug in the new UI or should I be more worried? Can someone explain what's going on over here?

Alternatively, if you want to see the token address of the pool token, then you can click on the etherscan link on the vault page and check the base token on the vault contract address.

If you'd like to avoid doing two transactions on Ethereum (first deposit on Curve, then on Yearn) then you can consider using either something like transaction builder in Gnosis safe so you can bundle the transaction yourself or zap provider such as portals.fi that will do it for you for a small fee.","szsemla#3508",""
