- **Info**
    - Consensus: 6/9 multisig
    - Initial Home Group: YFI Secret Admirers
    - Objective: Approve transactions
    - Signers: [[milkyklim]], [[Mariano]], [[Leo Cheng]], [[cp287]], [[banteg]], [[0xngmi]], [[Daryl Lau]], [[monoloco]], [[Lefteris]]
- **Overview**
    - yChad = "the multisig" as described in YIP-61 and elsewhere. Although it can be thought of as a yTeam, it is special and more critical than other yTeams.
    - It currently holds 3 powers:
    - - **Veto Power**: This power allows the Multisig to veto any decision and ideally should not be needed
    - - **Execution Power**: The power to execute decisions made by YFI holders and yTeams on-chain
    - - **Transitionary Power**: A temporary power enabling the Multisig to operate under the mandate of [[YIP 41: Temporarily Empower Multisig]] until the set of decision-making powers covers all needed transactions
    - Signers on yChad can only be changed via YIPs since YFI holders have the 'Change Multisig Signers' power.
- **Role**
    - Objective: *__Approve Transactions__*
    - TBD â€” let's clarify the specific expectations of yChad signers here
    - The role of yChad, the main multisig, emerged organically within Yearn. It is mainly about integrity, social capital, reputation, and availability. If 6 yChad signers colluded they could rug yearn, but at great reputational expense so the game theory is that the cost of bad actions to signers with high reputation is an effective protection.
